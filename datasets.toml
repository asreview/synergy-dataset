  eligibility_criteria = "Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) had a randomized design comparing 2 or more groups; (2) examined psychotherapy (the use of psychological methods to change behavior or overcome problems) targeting any mental health problem and delivered in any setting (including guided digital treatments); (3) compared the intervention with a control group (such as care as usual, enhanced care as usual, or waiting list); (4) reported suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), or self-harm leading to hospitalization (only included if the authors’ definition of self-harm included suicide attempts). Studies were excluded if they (1) used an intervention that did not involve any psychotherapeutic technique or support (eg, unguided self-help and community intervention) and (2) measured SI on a categorical scale, such as a single item of a questionnaire for depression. We included studies on all age groups."

  eligibility_criteria = "The first filter (abstract level) verified the following criteria: (i) empirical studies; (ii) narrative skills assessed in children or adolescents; (iii) were not case studies; (iv) published between 2010 and 2023; and (v) manuscript written in English or Spanish. Empirical studies included descriptive studies, experiments, quasi-experimental studies, ex post facto designs, and instrumental studies. In a second filter (full text), the selection was limited to those studies in which (i) statistics on the measurements are included and (ii) oral narratives are assessed (e.g., written narratives were excluded). Finally, regarding the target population, all the studies that considered participants who were children or adolescents with ID were include, even if they also included adults, TD participants, or participants with other diagnosis (e.g., studies with participant with autism but without ID were excluded, participants with autism and ID were included). The final criterion applied was the inclusion of participants with ID (third filter)."

  eligibility_criteria = "Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) Original full-text publications in English in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) Participants were adult burn survivors with any level of burn severity treated at a health care facility (both inpatient and outpatient samples were eligible); (3) in the case of mixed-trauma populations, separate statistics for burn survivors needed to be available; (4) a non-selective sampling method was used (e.g., including all consecutive burn survivors at a certain burn facility or after a disaster); (5) PTSD (or PTSD symptomatology) was assessed by a (semi) structured interview based on recognised diagnostic criteria for PTSD or a validated self-report PTSD questionnaire; and (6) sufficient information was provided to calculate prevalence rates and their standard error (i.e., the sample size and the number or percentage of PTSD cases). Studies of paediatric burns populations were excluded to focus on a homogeneous sample. Studies that reported the combined prevalence of a wider population (e.g., ‘injuries’) and studies with likely epidemiologically selective samples, such as qualitative studies, case reports, randomised controlled trials, effect studies, reviews, studies with sample sizes of fewer than ten participants, or studies including only combat casualties or complex multi-trauma survivors were also excluded. After the quality appraisal and data extraction, one post-hoc exclusion criterium was applied for the meta-analysis: studies that did not measure PTSD prevalence within 3 months around a specified time point following the event leading to the burn or discharge from hospital, and study estimates after 24 months post-burn, were excluded from the meta-analysis (see statistical analyses)."
