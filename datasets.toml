Still, we acknowledge the importance of various neuropathologies underlying the clinical manifestation of dementia.

Population. The population included in this review is adult or pediatric patients with spasticity or a musculoskeletal condition. We defined spasticity as muscle spasms associated with an upper motor neuron syndrome. Musculoskeletal conditions were defined as peripheral conditions resulting in muscle or soft tissue pain or spasms. We excluded obstetric and dialysis patients, and patients with restless legs syndrome or nocturnal myoclonus. Senate Bill specifically excludes patients with HIV and patients with cancer.

Drugs. We included the following oral drugs classified as skeletal muscle relaxants: baclofen, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, dantrolene, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, and tizanidine. Other medications used for spasticity but considered to be in another drug class, such as benzodiazepines, quinine, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and clonidine, were not considered primary drugs in this report, but were reviewed when they were directly compared to an included skeletal muscle relaxant. We excluded trials in which an included skeletal muscle relaxant was combined with an analgesic medication unless the comparison arm included the same analgesic medication and dose, trials which evaluated skeletal muscle relaxants not approved in the United States, and trials which only compared one dose of an included skeletal muscle relaxant with another dose.

Outcomes. The main efficacy measures were relief of muscle spasms or pain, functional status, quality of life, withdrawal rates, and adverse effects (including sedation, weakness, addiction, and abuse). We excluded non-clinical outcomes such as electromyogram measurements or spring tension measurements.

Study Types. We included the following study types: Systematic reviews of the clinical efficacy or adverse event rates of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity or musculoskeletal conditions, OR Randomized controlled trials that compared one of the included skeletal muscle relaxants listed to another included skeletal muscle relaxant, an antispasticity medication from a different drug class, or placebo in adult patients with spasticity or musculoskeletal conditions, OR Randomized controlled trials and large, high quality observational studies that reported adverse event rates for an included skeletal muscle relaxant. We did not systematically review case reports and case series in which the proportion of patients suffering an adverse event could not be calculated. We excluded “single-dose” studies, abstracts and unpublished trials unless a pharmaceutical company submitted the full data."""

Japan was included, as previous studies have shown that the Japanese healthcare system is comparable to the western health care system [9,10]. We excluded conference abstracts, non-original research, studies on paediatric population (defined as younger than eighteen years old), as well as studies addressing specific ethnographic subgroups within western healthcare systems. For meta analysis purposes, studies were filtered on reporting data from the Control Preference Scale (CPS), which is a questionnaire to assess the patients’ preference for their role in treatment decision making (Table 1)"""

eligibility_criteria = "We screened records to find original experimental studies that manipulated the condition of animals in independent treatment groups through their diet, via both dietary quantity (i.e. partial restriction, complete deprivation or enrichment) or quality treatments (e.g. protein restriction or enrichment), and including both short-term and longer-term manipulations up to extended periods of weeks to months. We screened for studies that then subjected those animals to behavioural observations in contexts relating to risk (e.g. novel environments, novel object, risk-sensitive foraging, predator response) in independent trials (for inclusion and exclusion decision trees see Appendix S1). we excluded studies using species with compromised genetic diversity and/or evolved adaptive responses (e.g. domesticated animals, laboratory breeds, genetically modified organisms; as per Kelly et al., 2018) as well as studies on humans. Studies manipulating the micronutrient content of diets, or subjecting animals to high-fat diets were also excluded as the relationship between these diet manipulations and body condition is not clear and was considered beyond the scope of this review. Dietary treatments were excluded as ‘non-independent’: (i) where the behaviour was measured in the presence of high and low food availability, or dietary treatments such as periods of deprivation were applied within the novel environment (i.e. non-independence of treatments from the behavioural assay); (ii) where the dietary treatments were coupled with additional non-dietary factors (e.g. temperature; i.e. non-independence of the diet factor within treatments); or, (iii) the dietary treatments were applied longitudinally (within individuals) rather than crosssectionally (i.e. non-independence between high and low treatments)."

In order to be eligible for inclusion, studies had to satisfy eligibility criteria specified by the PECO statement (Table 1). 

Population: Human or animal (whole organism) without restriction based on age, sex, or life stage at exposure or outcome assessment

Exposure: Any exposure/stressors at any life stage as long as the study design (i.e., outcome measurement stage) was transgenerational in nature (Fig. 1)
Comparators Humans: a comparison population exposed to lower levels (or no exposure/exposure below detection levels) of the stressor than the more highly exposed subjects

Animals: comparable animal populations exposed to vehicle-only treatment in experimental studies or a comparison animal population exposed to lower levels (or no exposure/exposure below detection levels) of the stressor than more highly exposed animals in wildlife/farm animals. Note: the comparison groups are defined at the time of exposure and therefore apply to the F0 generation (which in a gestational exposure would include exposure of the offspring (F1) and its gametes (F2); see Fig. 1)

Outcomes: Inherited diseases were excluded. No other restrictions on health outcome or effect measures

The following additional criteria were also used for exclusion:
• articles without original data (i.e., reviews, editorials, commentaries)
• studies of non-animal organisms (e.g., plants, fungi)
• in vitro exposure studies
• non-English publications"""
