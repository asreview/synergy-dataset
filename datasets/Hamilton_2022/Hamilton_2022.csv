Cross‐linguistic contributions of acoustic cues and prosodic awareness to first and second language vocabulary knowledge.,"Background: Several studies have revealed that prosody contributes to reading acquisition. However, the relation between awareness of prosodic patterns and different facets of language ability (e.g., vocabulary knowledge) in school‐age children remains unclear. This study measured awareness of prosodic patterns using non‐speech and speech stimuli. Methods: Hierarchical regression equations were computed to examine links among auditory cues (e.g., amplitude rise time, pitch contour and interval), language‐specific prosodic awareness and children's vocabulary knowledge in Mandarin as a first language (L1) and English as a second language (L2) after controlling for age and nonverbal IQ. Results: Results revealed that (1) amplitude envelope rise time discrimination predicted Mandarin L1 and English L2 vocabulary knowledge, (2) Mandarin tone perception and rhyme awareness did not predict Mandarin L1 vocabulary and (3) English rhyme awareness better predicted English L2 vocabulary than did stress production. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that (1) amplitude rise time, which signals syllable boundaries, is a cross‐linguistic predictor of vocabulary knowledge and (2) the development of English L2 vocabulary may depend on phonological more than prosodic awareness. Highlights: What is already known about this topicRise time discrimination is important to reading acquisition.Prosodic awareness is important to word reading.Phonological awareness is more important to English L2 word reading than is English stress production. What this paper addsRise time discrimination is important to not only Mandarin L1 but also English L2 vocabulary knowledge.Pitch discrimination is not a significant predictor of L1 vocabulary knowledge in a tone language like Mandarin.Phonological awareness is more important to English L2 vocabulary knowledge than is English stress production. Implications for theory, policy or practiceThe mechanism(s) of the links between prosodic and phonological awareness, vocabulary and reading in a second language should be further examined.English L2 reading instruction might put emphasis on phonological awareness first and on prosodic awareness later.L2 learners' prosodic awareness should be assessed with perception and production tasks taken into consideration.

How effective is it to teach a foreign language in the Foundation Stage through songs and rhymes?,; Songs and rhymes are common techniques used in the Foundation Stage and may play a vital role in developing children's interest for another language. This study focused on two sample groups revealing that songs and rhymes provide a basis for a more effective methodology for teaching languages to young learners,1
The Seuss boost: Rhyme helps children retain words from shared storybook reading.,"This study examines the potential benefits of rhyme on young children’s word retention during shared reading. In two experiments, 2- to 4-year-old children heard their parent read either a rhymed or non-rhymed version of the same animal story, and were then tested on how many animal names they subsequently recognized from the story in Experiment 1 and could correctly identify in Experiment 2. In both experiments, children performed better in the rhyme condition across the age range despite differing levels of word familiarity. While there were no other differences between conditions in parents’ reading styles or the emphasis placed on the animal names, parents’ dramatic pausing just before reading animal names may have promoted children’s ability to anticipate animals before they were initially named. These findings supported the hypothesis that rhyme combined with parental behavior can facilitate active prediction on the part of children, which in turn may contribute to their word retention and learning from the storybooks.

The impact of the integrative perceptual approach on the teaching of Chinese characters in a Hong Kong kindergarten,"; This study investigated the effectiveness of the integrative perceptual approach (IPA) to enhancing Hong Kong kindergarten children's Chinese character learning. The study applied the IPA to an experimental group of 29 lower form (K2) children. A group of 30 upper form children taught via traditional methods the year before, served as the control group. Quantitative data consisted of pre- and post-test scores, analysed using dependent and independent t-testing. It was found that the pupils in the experimental group had significantly improved their ability between pre- and post-testing in three aspects of Chinese character mastery: shape, sound and meaning recognition. The progress made was significantly superior to that made by control group counterparts. Qualitative data gathered through teacher and parent interviews indicated that the pupils in the experimental group displayed increased awareness of the composition of several components and structures of Chinese characters",1

Phonological skills and ability to perceive auditorily the structure of a word at the level of a single phoneme at ages 2–6.,"The present study is the first part of a longitudinal research project investigating whether children become more aware of phonemes or rhyming when they learn letters or letter sounds or even begin to read, and if so how. For the present paper, the phonological awareness of young children aged 2–6 years was analyzed, particularly their auditory knowledge of the phonemic structure of words as well as their knowledge of rhyme. Altogether, 110 children from Finnish day-care centres performed seven phonological tasks and a vocabulary size test. The results showed a clear age-dependent improvement in phonological awareness. Blending words of phonemes, separating rhyming words from each other and correcting words by substituting the wrong phoneme with the right one were found to be easier tasks for 2- to 5-year-old children than producing rhymes, twisting words or detecting an initial letter.

Accelerating early language development with multi-sensory training,"; This paper reports the outcome of a multi-sensory intervention on infant language skills. A programme titled ‘Rhyming Game and Exercise Club’, which included kinaesthetic–tactile mother–child rhyming games performed in natural joint attention situations, was intended to accelerate Finnish six- to eight-month-old infants’ language development. The participants were 20 infants (10 training group children and 10 control children). Their cognitive skills and both receptive and expressive language skills (Bayley Scales III) were tested three times (pre-, post- and follow-up assessments). The groups differed significantly in receptive language skills at the baseline, in favour of the controls. The results showed that the performance of the training group children in cognition and receptive language increased after the intervention. The training group girls showed more acceleration in receptive language skills than the boys. The results suggested that training consisting of rhyming games and kinaesthetic-tactile stimulation is a useful tool for accelerating early language development and for enriching mother–child interaction",0

Phonological awareness and emerging reading skills of two- to five-year-old children.,"This study, conducted in Finnish private and Montessori child care centres, aimed at investigating the development of the phonological awareness (PA) of two- to five-year-old preschool children within a six-month period in relation to emerging letter knowledge and reading skills. The children (N = 72) performed five phonological tasks and a vocabulary test, a letter knowledge test and a reading skills test twice; in the beginning, when knowing no letters, and at the end of the study. The results show that the children's performance in the different phonological tasks improved over a six-month period. Detecting word structure or blending phonemes were easier than producing rhymes or twisting. The children who had learned to recognize letters performed better in phonological tasks than the children who had not learned any letters, but children able to read precociously exceeded all. Our results appear to indicate that learning letters does not require previous PA ability but affects PA. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

Do Chinese- and English-speaking preschoolers think differently about language?,"Metalinguistic awareness is the ability to identify, reflect upon, and manipulate linguistic units. It plays a critical role in reading development. The present study investigated Chinese- and English-speaking preschoolers’ metalinguistic awareness development and the role of cognitive and linguistic abilities in its development. Forty-two Chinese-speaking and 36 English-speaking monolingual children completed a series of metalinguistic awareness, false belief, inhibitory control, and receptive vocabulary tasks. The results revealed distinct pathways for the two language groups. English speakers had a more advanced level of rhyme awareness. Chinese speakers developed homonym understanding faster during the preschool years. Inhibitory control was more important for Chinese speakers to develop synonym and homonym understanding, whereas receptive vocabulary was crucial for English speakers to develop rhyme awareness. These differences may be attributable to the characteristics of the Chinese and English languages, as well as the patterns of cognitive development in the two populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Children perceive speech onsets by ear and eye.,"Adults use vision to perceive low-fidelity speech; yet how children acquire this ability is not well understood. The literature indicates that children show reduced sensitivity to visual speech from kindergarten to adolescence. We hypothesized that this pattern reflects the effects of complex tasks and a growth period with harder-to-utilize cognitive resources, not lack of sensitivity. We investigated sensitivity to visual speech in children via the phonological priming produced by low-fidelity (non-intact onset) auditory speech presented audiovisually (see dynamic face articulate consonant/rhyme b/ag; hear non-intact onset/rhyme: –b/ag) vs. auditorily (see still face; hear exactly same auditory input). Audiovisual speech produced greater priming from four to fourteen years, indicating that visual speech filled in the non-intact auditory onsets. The influence of visual speech depended uniquely on phonology and speechreading. Children – like adults – perceive speech onsets multimodally. Findings are critical for incorporating visual speech into developmental theories of speech perception. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

"Developing multimodal communicative competence: Insights from ""semantic gravity"" and the Knowledge Process framework.","This article explores how EFL students' multimodal communicative competence can benefit from a pedagogical design, informed by ""semantic gravity"" (i.e. the extent to which meaning is dependent on a context) and the Knowledge Process framework (i.e. epistemic moves of experiencing, conceptualizing, analyzing, and applying). 68 Chinese EFL students were enrolled in a workshop-style course on becoming effective communicators. The study focused on a thematic unit about multimodal communication, which included two 90-min lessons and a take-home assignment (i.e. an essay on four subtitled versions of a nursery rhyme). The students were engaged in semantic waves between concrete multimodal products/practices and a multimodal metalanguage and pedagogical weaving between experiencing, conceptualizing, analyzing, and applying. Thematic analysis of the students' essays showed that the students were able to (a) analyze the metafunctions in the four subtitled videos; (b) analyze modal contribution and intersemiotic complementarity; (c) evaluate the subtitles from a semiotic perspective; (d) offer ideas to recreate the subtitled nursery rhyme as a multimodal ensemble; and (e) recognize the multimodal nature of communication. Implications are drawn for EFL teachers to use ""semantic gravity"" and the Knowledge Process framework to move pedagogies in the direction of multimodality. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Pilot study evaluating the impact of dialogic reading and shared reading at transition to primary school: early literacy skills and parental attitudes.,"Previous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of shared reading (SR) and dialogic reading (DR) on young children's language and literacy development. This exploratory study compared the relative impact of parental DR and shared reading interventions on 4-year-old children's early literacy skills and parental attitudes to reading prior to and following school entry. Parents were trained using a self-instruction training DVD. The children's rhyme awareness, word reading, concepts about print and writing vocabulary were assessed before and after 6 weeks over the summer period and again after one term in school. Four illustrative case studies are presented, which reveal the differential impact of the interventions on the families who participated. Findings indicated that DR had a positive impact on children's enjoyment of reading, concepts about print, parent-child reading behaviours and parental attitudes to joint storybook reading. The children who experienced shared-book reading during the intervention also demonstrated improvements in word reading. There were no changes in rhyme awareness or writing vocabulary for either group. Changes in print concept awareness were not maintained at follow-up, but improvements in writing vocabulary and word reading scores were noted. The reasons for this are discussed with reference to the formal literacy instruction the children received during their first academic term. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Preserving Guam's culture with culturally responsive children's stories.,"Regardless of where schools are located, teachers face the challenge of teaching and mentoring children, not only in academic achievement but in social emotional development. When faced with challenges, young children are especially vulnerable because they lack the life experience and developmental maturity to adequately cope. Relying on the lead author's personal experiences in leading Guam's university teacher preparation program and in developing an early childhood education literacy program, this article demonstrates how teachers adapted popular Mother Goose nursery rhymes, tales, and local indigenous stories, making stories relevant to the local culture in Guam. Stories, specifically aligned with local cultures and traditions, are recommended as an intervention strategy to strengthen children's emerging literacy skills and to strengthen children's self-identity and resilience. In particular, offering opportunities for students to see oneself and one's culture in children's literature builds cultural esteem and a sense of community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"Less Generation Z, more Jumanji.","Welcome to the second issue of the journal for 2021. As we enter what will hopefully be the final chapter of the current pandemic (although we seem to recall that we said exactly the same thing back in the last DATE editorial four months ago), this issue provides opportunities for sharing recent research alongside some speculation about how things might change, what lessons have been learned, and what future research may focus on. The issue includes five research articles, a reflection piece and a book review. The research articles fall broadly into two categories with the first two reporting on research into the implementation on digital technologies in design and technology classroom activities whilst the final three articles are more focused on pedagogy, with the final two articles focused on undergraduate industrial and product design learning and teaching approaches. The last year has shown us what living through a global pandemic is really like, and surprise, surprise it's not much like what Hollywood predicted. Gun toting virus infected monkeys (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014) and a zombie dodging Brad Pitt (World War Z, 2013) are nowhere to be seen, although London did look reminiscent of a scene straight from Danny Boyle's 2002 film 28 Days Later for most of 2020. What has been most people's reality, especially for those of us working in education, has been a year spent learning and applying new learning and teaching technologies, fighting for limited resources, and dealing with the inevitable and very real human issues, both our own and those of others around us. In this issue's reflection piece Deborah Winn compares the difficulties faced by teachers of practical subjects in the last year or so as like being in the rope bridge scene in the 2019 film Jumanji: The Next Level, having to move forward at all costs while being chased by psychotic monkeys. We are sure that we can all empathise with her. So while Hollywood may have got it wrong in their many depictions of post pandemic scenarios, we can perhaps all agree that there are some movie scenes that seem to fit the bill quite well, hence the title of this editorial (it does rhyme if you say it in an American accent, which we are sure you have all have done in your heads). Hopefully this issue will provide us with some food for thought and allow us to reflect on our own educational practices as we consider how best to approach the next stage of this saga. The first research article focuses on the use of augmented reality (AR) in practical classroom situations. In Using augmented reality (AR) in vocational education programs to teach occupational health and safety (OHS), Renk Hülagü and Önder Erkarslan from Izmir Institute of Technology, Turkey present research from a study into the teaching of occupational health and safety (OHS) in Turkey within secondary schools and universities, with a view to designing a new system of teaching OHS using AR to raise awareness of risk, make students more cautious and appreciative of the task at hand, and therefore hopefully reduce accidents. They discuss the need for students to experience risk in order to develop safe working methods in workshop activities and an appreciation of precautions and safety measures.

"Pie, fry, why: Language play in 3- to 5-year-old children.","This study examined the relationship between four common types of language play and their correlations with the verbal and social abilities of 3- to 5-year-old children. While observation has shown that children this age produce a range of play, research has not yet examined whether play is a measurable skill connected to preschoolers’ language development. In this study, we designed four language play elicitation games involving creating rhymes, word switching, word creation, and hyperbolic play. Children’s ability to produce novel play for each game was measured, and classroom teachers filled out assessments of children’s verbal and peer interaction skills. Results indicated that while children’s peer interaction scores were not related to their play scores, verbal skills scores were highly correlated with language play scores, highlighting that for preschoolers the ability to produce common types of language play may be a distinctly verbal skill.

Exploring physically active play in the early childhood curriculum from a complexity thinking perspective.,"This paper conceptualizes the teaching and learning of physically active play (PAP) in the early childhood curriculum. The conceptualization emerges from ‘doing complexivist bricolage’ and draws on complexity thinking features and concepts to position teaching and learning in PAP as children and teachers together exploring three different and coupled facets: fundamental movement patterns, group movement activities and group games. The three facets are different and coupled to highlight that they can be viewed as simultaneously separate and inseparable. This allows us to make sense of each facet and remind us that they are mutually influencing. Exploring fundamental movement patterns means focusing on exploring patterns and variations associated with one or more particular movement skills and balancing skills, and doing so in the context of individual activities, group movement activities or games. Exploring group movement activities involve children moving with their bodies as they engage in rhymes, songs and stories, thereby enabling children to develop both fundamental movement skills and literacy skills. Engaging in group games focuses on supporting children to learn the nature of games as socially constructed activities with some explicit rules agreed upon by players. I position teaching and learning as acts of joint exploration that embrace diverse learners (children and teachers) and different learning outcomes for individuals. In this joint exploration, the teacher plays two important roles: (1) fostering children’s and their own confidence and competence in PAP and (2) creating conditions that simultaneously constrain and enable as they follow, generate and sustain children’s interests in their explorations together. This approach enables teachers to respond to children’s interests and co-create learning situations with children in ways that are emergent and meaningful to all. When used in conjunction with mandated curriculum frameworks, it can open up possibilities for curriculum, teaching and learning for children and teachers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Is One Ear Good Enough? Unilateral Hearing Loss and Preschoolers' Comprehension of the English Plural.,"Purpose: The plural is one of the first grammatical morphemes acquired by English-speaking children with normal hearing (NH). Yet, those with hearing loss show delays in both plural comprehension and production. However, little is known about the effects of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) on children's acquisition of the plural, where children's ability to perceive fricatives (e.g., the /s/ in cats) can be compromised. This study therefore tested whether children with UHL were able to identify the grammatical number of newly heard words, both singular and plural. Method: Eleven 3- to 5-year-olds with UHL participated in a novel word two-alternative forced choice task presented on an iPad. Their results were compared to those of 129 NH 3- to 5-year-olds. During the task, children had to choose whether an auditorily presented novel word was singular (e.g., tep, koss) or plural (e.g., teps, kosses) by touching the appropriate novel picture. Results: Like their NH peers, children with UHL demonstrated comprehension of novel singulars. However, they were significantly less accurate at identifying novel plurals, with performance at chance. However, there were signs that their ability to identify novel plurals may improve with age. Conclusion: While comparable to their NH peers at identifying novel singulars, these results suggest that young children with UHL do not yet have a robust representation of plural morphology, particularly on words they have not encountered before.

Persistent Neurobehavioral Markers of Developmental Morphosyntax Errors in Adults.,"Purpose: Child language acquisition is marked by an optional infinitive period (ages 2-4 years) during which children use nonfinite (infinitival) verb forms and finite verb forms interchangeably in grammatical contexts that require finite forms. In English, children's errors include omissions of past tense /--ed/ and 3rd-person singular /--s/. This language acquisition period typically ends by the age of 4 years, but it persists in children with language impairments. It is unknown if adults still process optional infinitives differently than other kinds of morphosyntax errors. Method: We compared behavior and functional brain activation during grammaticality judgments across sentences with developmental optional infinitive tense/agreement errors (""Yesterday I play the song""), nondevelopmental agreement errors (""He am tall"") that do not occur in typical child language acquisition, and grammatically correct sentences. Results: Adults (N = 25) were significantly slower and less accurate in judging sentences with developmental errors relative to other sentences. Sentences with developmental errors yielded greater activation in bilateral inferior frontal gyri relative to nondevelopmental error sentences in both auditory and visual modalities. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the heightened computational demands for finiteness extend well beyond early childhood and continue to exert their influence on grammatical mental and brain function in adulthood.

Learning a second language: Can music aptitude or music training have a role?,"Some studies suggest that children receiving music training perform better than other children when learning a second language (L2). In contrast, other studies indicate that music aptitude correlates positively with L2 learning. The relationship between music (training or aptitude) and L2 is stronger for skills that are based upon perceptual-auditory skills (e.g., dictation) than for skills that are not based upon perceptual-auditory skills (e.g., grammar). We investigated the relationship between music training, music aptitude, and L2 learning in Italian students between 11 and 15 years old. We recruited students who were either receiving music training or not. The music aptitude of all students was assessed with a dedicated test (PROMS). Participants completed an English grammar and an English dictation task. Music training (and not aptitude) explained performance in both dictation and grammar, although it was significant only in the dictation; in other words, students who were receiving music training performed significantly better in the dictation than students who were not.

New evidence of a rhythmic priming effect that enhances grammaticality judgments in children.,"Musical rhythm and the grammatical structure of language share a surprising number of characteristics that may be intrinsically related in child development. The current study aimed to understand the potential influence of musical rhythmic priming on subsequent spoken grammar task performance in children with typical development who were native speakers of English. Participants (ages 5–8 years) listened to rhythmically regular and irregular musical sequences (within-participants design) followed by blocks of grammatically correct and incorrect sentences upon which they were asked to perform a grammaticality judgment task. Rhythmically regular musical sequences improved performance in grammaticality judgment compared with rhythmically irregular musical sequences. No such effect of rhythmic priming was found in two nonlinguistic control tasks, suggesting a neural overlap between rhythm processing and mechanisms recruited during grammar processing. These findings build on previous research investigating the effect of rhythmic priming by extending the paradigm to a different language, testing a younger population, and employing nonlanguage control tasks. These findings of an immediate influence of rhythm on grammar states (temporarily augmented grammaticality judgment performance) also converge with previous findings of associations between rhythm and grammar traits (stable generalized grammar abilities) in children. Taken together, the results of this study provide additional evidence for shared neural processing for language and music and warrant future investigations of potentially beneficial effects of innovative musical material on language processing.

Songs vs. stories: impact of input sources on ESL vocabulary acquisition by preliterate children.,"Research in second language acquisition has paid little attention to preliterate children learning a language which is absent from their environment outside the language class. This study examines the acquisition of English words by 24 French-speaking children aged 35–59 months, who were introduced to 57 words, embedded in stories and songs. Four stories and four songs were randomly spread across four consecutive weekly workshops consisting of play-based pedagogical activities. The impact of the input source, number of encounters with each lexical item, animacy as a feature of the lexical items, and first language (L1) lexicon size was examined. Recall of target words was assessed through the selection between four images after hearing the word, and L1 lexicon was assessed through the Peabody test. Results show significantly higher recall for animate concepts, while no difference in recall was found in relation to input source (words in songs vs. stories) or L1 lexicon size. Results also stress the need for a possibly higher number of encounters than that normally found for adults in order to achieve significant recall. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",1
Comprehension of Written Grammar Test: Reliability and Known-Groups Validity Study With Hearing and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students.,"The aim of the current study was to gather validation evidence for the Comprehension of Written Grammar (CWG; Easterbrooks, 2010) receptive test of 26 grammatical structures of English print for use with children who are deaf and hard of hearing (DHH). Reliability and validity data were collected for 98 participants (49 DHH and 49 hearing) in Grades 2-6. The objectives were to: (a) examine 4-week test-retest reliability data; and (b) provide evidence of known-groups validity by examining expected differences between the groups on the CWG vocabulary pretest and main test, as well as selected structures. Results indicated excellent test-retest reliability estimates for CWG test scores. DHH participants performed statistically significantly lower on the CWG vocabulary pretest and main test than the hearing participants. Significantly lower performance by DHH participants on most expected grammatical structures (e.g., basic sentence patterns, auxiliary ""be"" singular/plural forms, tense, comparatives, and complementation) also provided known groups evidence. Overall, the findings of this study showed strong evidence of the reliability of scores and known group-based validity of inferences made from the CWG. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
The Role of Frequency in Learning Morphophonological Alternations: Implications for Children With Specific Language Impairment.,"Purpose: The aim of this article was to explore how the type of allomorph (e.g., past tense buzz[d] vs. nod[əd]) influences the ability to perceive and produce grammatical morphemes in children with typical development and with specific language impairment (SLI). Method: The participants were monolingual Australian English-speaking children. The SLI group included 13 participants (mean age = 5;7 [years;months]); the control group included 19 children with typical development (mean age = 5;4). Both groups performed a grammaticality judgment and elicited production task with the same set of nonce verbs in thirdperson singular and past tense forms. Results: Five-year-old children are still learning to generalize morphophonological patterns to novel verbs, and syllabic /əz/ and /əd/ allomorphs are significantly more challenging to produce, particularly for the SLI group. The greater phonetic content of these syllabic forms did not enhance perception. Conclusions: Acquisition of morphophonological patterns involving low-frequency allomorphs is still underway in 5-year-old children with typical development, and it is even more protracted in SLI populations, despite these patterns being highly predictable. Children with SLI will therefore benefit from targeted intervention with low-frequency allomorphs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
Influences of Phonological Context on Tense Marking in Spanish-English Dual Language Learners.,"Purpose: The emergence of tense-morpheme marking during language acquisition is highly variable, which confounds the use of tense marking as a diagnostic indicator of language impairment in linguistically diverse populations. In this study, we seek to better understand tense-marking patterns in young bilingual children by comparing phonological influences on marking of 2 wordfinal tense morphemes. Method: In spontaneous connected speech samples from 10 Spanish-English dual language learners aged 56-66 months (M = 61.7, SD = 3.4), we examined marking rates of past tense -ed and third person singular -s morphemes in different environments, using multiple measures of phonological context. Results: Both morphemes were found to exhibit notably contrastive marking patterns in some contexts. Each was most sensitive to a different combination of phonological influences in the verb stem and the following word. Conclusions: These findings extend existing evidence from monolingual speakers for the influence of wordfinal phonological context on morpheme production to a bilingual population. Further, novel findings not yet attested in previous research support an expanded consideration of phonological context in clinical decision making and future research related to wordfinal morphology.

Using songs to enhance L2 vocabulary acquisition in preschool children.,"This article looks at the effects of a teaching sequence of song-based activities on the L2 vocabulary acquisition of a group of five-year-old Spanish child EFL learners. Twenty-five preschool children received three 30-minute lessons organized around the presentation and practice of a well-known children’s song. Vocabulary picture tests were administered to each child immediately before and after the teaching sessions, followed by a delayed post-test five weeks later. The findings of this small piece of research seem to provide some evidence to show that teaching new language through a song can lead to the development of children’s receptive knowledge of vocabulary. However, exposure to the song input was insufficient to develop productive knowledge in the majority of the children. Some implications for learning English in preschool are discussed.

"Assessing English vocabulary and enhancing young English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ motivation through games, songs, and stories.","In Taiwan, English was only officially taught at the secondary and tertiary levels before 2001. Since 2001, English courses have been formally incorporated into the curriculum in primary schools. Research on teaching and assessing English in primary school education is relatively new compared with research on other levels of education in Taiwan. The present study investigated the degree to which games, songs, and stories helped increase primary school pupils’ English vocabulary size and encouraged learning in an intensive English course. It also explored how different test techniques influenced pupils’ performance on a vocabulary test. Seventy-two primary school pupils participated in the study. The results showed that games, songs, and stories had a positive effect on learning and increasing the pupils’ English vocabulary. In the vocabulary test, the pupils in higher grades outperformed those in lower grades and performed differently in terms of test techniques. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",1
Predictors of the Instructional Strategies that Elementary School Teachers Use with English Language Learners.,"Background/Context: According to demographers, the number of English language learners (ELLs) in U.S schools has been increasing and is likely to continue to increase in coming years. For various reasons relating to language acquisition, cultural adjustment, and persistent discrimination, these students tend to experience academic difficulties. Improvement in their performance depends on teachers ' use of effective instructional strategies, but few surveys have investigated the extent to which teachers use such strategies or the conditions that encourage them to do so. Focus of Study: This study addressed the following research questions: (a) To what extent do elementary content-area teachers use various research-based practices for teaching ELLs? (b) In consideration of appropriate statistical controls, to what extent are elementary content-area teachers' professional training, attitudes, bilingualism, and their schools' characteristics, singly and in combination, associated with their reported use of a set of research-based strategies for teaching English language learners? Participants: Participants were a random sample of Ohio elementary school teachers (n = 419) in schools in the highest quartile of ELL enrollment. Research Design: The current study surveyed elementary teachers in Ohio and then used multiple regression methods to identify significant predictors of teachers' use of research-based strategies with ELLs. Findings: Findings showed that teachers reported frequent use of research-based strategies, but their preference was for strategies recommended for all learners. They were less likely to use strategies specifically intended for ELLs. In addition, regression results showed that teachers' attitudes and the percentage of ELLs in their schools were significant predictors of teachers' use of research-based strategies--a positive predictor in the first instance and a negative predictor in the second. Ancillary analyses revealed that teachers ' years of experience and bilingualism, as well as the schools' resources, were significant predictors of teachers' attitudes toward ELLs, with more experienced teachers exhibiting more negative attitudes, and bilingual teachers and those in higher resource schools exhibiting more positive attitudes. Conclusions/Recommendations: Findings point to the likelihood that continued efforts to prepare elementary school teachers to work with ELLs will entail the provision of additional resources to schools with large and increasing ELL populations. In addition, efforts to increase teachers' use of research-based strategies with ELLs will involve professional preparation powerful enough to change attitudes. Instruction in a second language appears to be an approach that bears consideration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
'Untold Stories to Tell': Making Space For The Voices of Youth Songwriters.,"The article looks at the benefits songwriting can have on English language arts (ELA) education. Drawing from her experience as a ELA teacher, the author discusses her research on songwriting among students and how schools support this hobby. She focuses on the language of adolescents, noting the importance of using common language and literacy practices to make connections to academic literacy. Information is provided on two students who write rap music and the grounded theory and constant comparison methods the author used to analyze their work. The content, style, and vocabulary of the songs are then examined.",0
Expanding the Power of Read-Alouds.,"The article discusses teachers choosing the best children's literature for read-alouds to provide their students with foundations of literacy and English language. Topics include key concepts of literacy that are touched on through read-alouds, such as vocabulary, phonemic awareness, and fluency, the use of questions for post read-aloud discussions, and using songs to present features of language such as rhythm, intonation, and stress.",0
"American Music Immersion: Influencing Factors and Its Impact on Taiwanese EFL Learners Engaged in Web-Based, Multimedia Music Study.","The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence American music immersion (AMI) in Taiwanese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners and to determine if AMI is a predictor of vocabulary acquisition and American lifestyle literacy improvement during online, multimedia music study. The results of this study suggest that those subjects 29 years old and under are more immersed in American music than their 30 years old and over counterparts and that freshmen are significantly less immersed in American music than sophomores, juniors, and seniors. It was also found that those who never or occasionally watch programs in English or speak in English are significantly less immersed in American music than those who somewhat often or frequently watch programs in English or speak in English. In addition, the findings suggest that AMI alone is not a good predictor of vocabulary acquisition or lifestyle literacy improvement during online, multimedia music study. Finally, the study found that some minimal level of English competency is required to benefit from this type of multimedia learning environment. Implications for practice are provided.

Psychological explanations: A reply to Thomas (2002).,"SummaryGary Thomas’ interesting paper (Thomas, 2002) raises issues which are relevant to both the theory and the practice of educational psychology. Whilst the author is sympathetic to his general thesis, there are still issues which are obscure. This paper attempts to offer a reply to some of these and to stimulate further debate amongst both researchers and practitioners.Psychological Explanations: A replyThomas’ central point is a negative one: that appeal to some supposed psychological faculty does nothing to explain behaviour. Opium induces sleep, but to say that it does so because of a virtus dormitiva (something sleep-inducing) tells us nothing; similarly, according to Thomas (p. 164 ff.), children’s inability to read cannot be usefully ascribed to some supposed faculty or construct, ‘phonological awareness’, which somehow underlies their performance and which the children lack. But, like many other writers, he takes this to be an empirical thesis (“findings consistent with the thesis being advanced here have come repeatedly from research over the past two or three decades”, p. 165); as if it were logically possible for it to be false. In this he follows those whom he criticises (Farnham-Diggory, 1992; Goswami & Bryant, 1990): it is as if he disagreed with them about a matter of fact, about what is actually the case although it might have been otherwise.The connection between what is supposed to explain and what is supposed to be explained in such cases is a conceptual and not an empirical one. Just as part of the meaning of virtus dormitiva is “sleep-inducing”, so (a little less obviously) part of the meaning of “being able to read” is “phonological awareness: that is, the ability to pronounce—in effect, to read—words correctly. In the same way, some supposed mathematical faculty—“being good at manipulating numbers”, perhaps could not be used to explain ‘being good at arithmetic’, since the former is conceptually part of the latter.Quite a lot of supposed psychological explanation is of this kind. To use some other examples (for which see Wilson, 1972), “People who like each other tend to get on better” and “Students who are more motivated will, other things being equal, learn more” are, pretty obviously, logical or conceptual truths rather than empirical truths or matters of fact. But often the status of the assertion is unclear. Thus an empirical enquiry into whether popular people were warm, supportive and friendly might be thought unnecessary, on the grounds that there is a conceptual overlap between “popular” and “warm, supportive and friendly”. On the other hand, the researcher might mean by “popular” something like “supported or voted for by a lot of people”: in that sense, Hitler and Margaret Thatcher would count as popular, without any implication that they were warm or supportive or friendly; and then the enquiry could be genuinely empirical. Great care has to be taken to determine what various researchers actually do mean by the terms they use, since the status of their research depends on that.Thomas gives the impression that he is actually against the existence or at least the explanatory power of mental faculties. Even after careful reading, it is unclear whether he believes in mental faculties at all (in his summary he writes of “supposed faculties (such as memory or awareness)”). But nobody with a grasp of the English language could seriously doubt that terms like “intelligence”, “imagination”, “memory”, and others stood for (fairly general) mental powers, capabilities or abilities: one would have to believe that when we said things like “He’s very intelligent”, “She’s a rather unimaginative person”, “His memory is pretty poor”, and so on we were talking about mythical objects like unicorns or phlogiston.Further, we often use faculties to explain performance. Someone is bad at history: this may be because he lacks general intelligence, or because he has a very bad memory for dates and other historical facts, or it might be because he just hates the subject, so that the cause is not a faculty or ability at all but a kind of disposition or motivational state. The question will be open, but the presence or absence or adequacy of a faculty may answer it. But, of course, we must be able to identify the faculty independently of the performance: otherwise we fall into the virtus dormitiva trap, or find ourselves saying that failure to read must be due to “verbal interpretation incompetence” (where this means no more than “being unable to read”); or, to take a topical example, that if some person cannot or will not pay due attention he must be suffering from “Attention Deficit Syndrome” as if that phrase named some disease which caused the overt behaviour. Thomas is right to warn us of this danger; but that is no reason for dispensing with mental faculties altogether.Nor is it a reason for turning our backs on the physiological preconditions, or constituents, or correspondences with mental powers and performances. Again we are uncertain about how far Thomas really wants to do this; but he talks (p. 164) of “an assumption that an ability could be understood physiologically” (his italics), and says “The assumption is dualistic: that ‘abilities’ emerge out of ‘physiological processes’ in the brain”. Now we know very well that mental powers depend on brain-states: that if people suffer from brain damage some of their mental powers lapse: even that certain types of brain-states correlate with certain mental powers. In that sense they are dependent on, or ‘emerge out of’, certain physiological conditions.That, presumably, is not what Thomas wishes to deny. What perhaps he wishes to deny, quite rightly, is the possibility of a description of some mental ability being translated into purely physiological terms: as if the expression “intelligent” meant “such-and-such neurones moving in such-and-such ways”, or as if the chess-move “pawn to king four” could be translated into statements about the movement of a wooden object. In that sense he is right to claim that an ability cannot be “understood physiologically”. But that does not mean that abilities do not have a physiological background and physiological connections or preconditions or perhaps even fairly detailed correspondence. The sentence he is criticising (from Farnham-Diggory, 1992) begins, “Exactly what this ability involves physiologically is not fully understood”; and that is harmless enough, for whilst what we mean by “being able to read” cannot be translated into physiological terms, it certainly involves certain physiological states. And it is obviously important to discover what these states are.There is a general lesson here which it is important for both researchers and practitioners to learn, and which goes far beyond the particular points that I have mentioned above. What these points demonstrate is the absolute necessity of saying clearly what we mean when we use certain words both in theory and in practice. For if we do not do this, we cannot be clear about just what actual phenomena the words are supposed to describe—we cannot even identify the phenomena properly, let alone explain them.Thus both research in reading and special pedagogies designed to improve reading will be geared, consciously or unconsciously, to some conception of what reading is or what the ability to read consists of. But that is already a misleading way of putting it: “what reading is” or “what the ability to read consists of” might be taken as the titles of some empirical enquiry, an enquiry into the constituents of water and find that if was made up of H20. We have, rather, to determine first what “reading” or “able to read” mean; and that is a logical or linguistic rather than a factual or scientific enquiry. In the same way we need to know what we mean by “intelligence” before we can enquire into what intelligence is made up of: otherwise we should not know just what is was that we were enquiring into under the heading of “intelligence” rather than some other heading.There are in fact some (fairly obvious) questions to be asked about both these concepts. The meaning of “intelligent” does not include either the idea of factual knowledge or the idea of being motivated: if a person knows little or nothing about a subject, or the person is not disposed to be interested in it, that is no criticism of their intelligence. But is there any conceptual connection between intelligence and memory? Certainly we can say “It’s not that he’s unintelligent, it’s just that he has a bad memory”; but suppose we ask someone to solve a lengthy problem which involves quite a lot of information, and by the time they come to the end of the problem they have forgotten the information we gave them at the beginning. Is that lack of intelligence? (“A is bigger than B”. “OK, I’ve got that”. “B is bigger than C”. “Fine, B’s bigger than C, I understand”. “So what can you tell us about A and C?” “Sorry, I forgot what you said about a minute ago ...”). Or, again, is being able to solve problems quickly part of what we mean by “intelligent”? Are brilliant chess-moves more brilliant if they take only a short time to think up? Is it fair to time IQ tests?It may be that we are so used to employing these words, and engaging in various practices connected with what they stand for, that we think we already know well enough what we mean. But even the concept marked by “reading” is far from clear. Thus (1) “reading” presumably involves more than just making appropriate pronounciation: it involves some kind of understanding of what is read. But how much understanding, and understanding of what? Of grammar and syntax and sentence-structure only, or of semantics also? Or (2) what kind of content does “the ability to read” involve? What vocabulary is supposed to be used; what subject matter is the person supposed to be familiar with? Nursery rhymes, shopping lists, descriptions of everyday occurrences at school, fairy tales, the lyrics of pop music, or what? Whether a person is “able to read” or not will be largely relative to this content and vocabulary. One might even ask (3) what kind of script or symbols are we talking about? A person can read English (in capital letters or minuscules), Chinese ideograms and Egyptian hieroglyphics, mathematical equations, maps and charts, graphs, musical scores, and many other things: there is no reason to suppose that there is something called “the ability to read” which is totally independent of the symbolic medium.The point here is not that we need, as it were, to be a little more precise about the words we use; as if that were something we could easily do in our spare time, before undertaking the serious empirical enquiry. It is rather that without investigating the meaning of words we literally do not know what we are talking about, so that much of our psychological theory and educational practice is disconnected from the real world. In natural science the danger is less: we do indeed know pretty well what is meant by (for instance) “planet”, “movement”, and perhaps “atom”; we can identify these things because we know what the words mean, and go on to try to explain them. But anyone who thinks that we know, just as clearly and unequivocally, what is meant by “intelligence”, “memory”, “motivation”, “cognition”, “affect” and other terms with which psychology deals needs to think again.Working out what words mean should not be conceived as a kind of (perhaps rather tiresome) preliminary to research and practice, but as part of them. Yet is seems that few empirical researchers even understand the task. For instance, in the same issue of the journal in which Thomas’ article appears there was an interesting paper on “Circle Time” (Lown, 2002), with a section entitled “Definitions of circle time”. Here we are told (p. 94) that White (1989) shares the view with other authors (Lang & Moslay 1993; Margerison 1996) that circle time is in the main a tool for improving self-esteem, but adds that in so doing it also improves learning. White (1989) also sees circle time as a method of cultivating group identity and cohesion. Housego and Burns (1994) agree with the idea that circle time can and should enhance learning ... Another frequently stated view in the literature is that circle time is a method of improving circle skills ...And so on.Now it is abundantly clear that whatever this is, it is not an attempt to say what the phrase “circle time” means. It does not even try to do that. Typically, writers ‘collect definitions’ from other people, without themselves saying what a term means or how it is used: and, worse, what they collect are not really definitions at all, but (as here) a series of remarks connected with some phenomenon (‘circle time’) which are already supposed to be identifiable. Normally we define words, not things: “Define that word ‘dog’” makes sense, but not “Define this dog”.The above points have been belaboured because it is fatally easy to see the task of defining terms—of laying out what is conceptually involved by for example, “intelligence”, or “reading” or “self-esteem” or any other term, and what is not conceptually involved—as in some pejorative sense “academic” (too “abstract”, “philosophical”, or even “nit-picking”). But it is surely obvious, even without the benefit of lengthy argument, that (for instance) what we count as “a disability” or “a learning difficulty”, what we mean by “dyslexic” or “autism”, what we take to be part or not part of the logic of the expression “gifted and talented”, “disruptive”, “hyperactive” and so on will inevitably give a certain direction to our research and hence to our practice. What we do is driven by how we think, and how we think is largely determined by the concepts we use. The author hopes that these remarks, brief and sketchy though they are, will at least show the importance of this enterprise. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
The importance of phonological awareness for the development of early English reading skills among bilingual Singaporean kindergartners.,"To examine the relationship between phonological awareness (PA) and English word-level reading among a multilingual sample, a random sample of 297 Singaporean kindergartners, stratified by ethnicity (169 Chinese, 65 Malay, and 63 Indian), were tested on their PA, receptive vocabulary, and word-level reading skills. Singaporean kindergartners are all bilingual or early second-language (L2) learners of English and learn English reading through logographic (look-say) instruction. Overall, Singaporean kindergartners scored lower than mostly monolingual US norming groups on English vocabulary and PA but higher than US norms on English reading, confirming findings in other contexts that L2 learners of English can be successful at word-level reading despite low levels of oral proficiency. However, these findings challenge the hypothesis based on Seymour's dual foundations model of reading that learning an alphabetic language logographically slows reading acquisition. Despite a curriculum which did not teach sound-symbol correspondences for reading English, PA had a larger, statistically significant influence than vocabulary (also statistically significant) on English reading with both variables in a multilevel regression model, controlling for demographic factors. These findings highlight the importance of PA to English reading, even in bilingual and L2 learning children who were taught to read English logographically. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
Nonverbal Communication: Implications for the Global Music Classroom.,"Many American schools today have richly diverse classrooms composed of immigrants with a limited vocabulary or little command of the English language. Now more than ever, music educators must explore new, creative, and effective ways to communicate with this ever-changing student population. Although most teachers rely primarily on verbal communication in the classroom, others are introducing nonverbal communication—the process of communicating through sending and receiving wordless messages with their students. This technique has become increasingly helpful in communicating with students when English is not their primary language. Music educators must be prepared to teach students from many cultures. We need to develop effective strategies of communication, which in turn will contribute to the success of our music programs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
No Hablo Inglés: Breaking the Language Barrier in Music Instruction.,"Advice for music educators on breaking the language barrier when teaching music to non-English-speaking Hispanic students is provided.  When working with English language learners (ELL), music educators should show respect, get students involved, and study the culture.  In addition, they should facilitate students in their language development, help ELL children in building a vocabulary through hand signals, select songs that include a lot of repetition so that ELL children have multiple opportunities to succeed, and occasionally sing songs in a language besides English.",0
The effect of singing paired with signing on receptive vocabulary skills of elementary ESL students.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of singing paired with signing on receptive vocabulary skills of elementary English as a Second Language (ESL) students. Eighty children attended language sessions in one of the following rehearsal conditions: sung text paired with signs, spoken text paired with signs, sung text, and a control group of spoken text only. Pretest and posttest data were analyzed to determine gains in receptive vocabulary identification. Results from this study indicate that all four groups made significant pretest to posttest gains. Children in the sung text paired with sign and the spoken text paired with sign conditions, however, made significantly greater gains in vocabulary recognition than those in the control condition of spoken text only. These findings suggest the benefits of integrating signs into second language rehearsal to provide visual cues and to engage students in meaningful physical participation. The condition yielding the highest mean gain score was that in which signing was paired with singing, indicating there may be advantages to using a combination of the two for language acquisition.

Factors That Enhance English-Speaking Speech-Language Pathologists' Transcription of Cantonese-Speaking Children' s Consonants.,"Purpose: To investigate speech-language pathology students' ability to identify errors and transcribe typical and atypical speech in Cantonese, a nonnative language. Method: Thirty-three English-speaking speech-language pathology students completed 3 tasks in an experimental within-subjects design. Results: Task 1 (baseline) involved transcribing English words. In Task 2, students transcribed 25 words spoken by a Cantonese adult. An average of 59.1% consonants was transcribed correctly (72.9%when Cantonese-English transfer patterns were allowed). There was higher accuracy on shared English and Cantonese syllable-initial consonants /m,n,f,s,h, j,w,l/ and syllable-final consonants. In Task 3, students identified consonant errors and transcribed 100 words spoken by Cantonese-speaking children under 4 additive conditions: (1) baseline, (2) +adult model, (3) +information about Cantonese phonology, and (4) all variables (2 and 3 were counterbalanced). There was a significant improvement in the students' identification and transcription scores for conditions 2, 3, and 4, with a moderate effect size. Increased skill was not based on listeners' proficiency in speaking another language, perceived transcription skill, musicality, or confidence with multilingual clients. Conclusion: Speech-language pathology students, with no exposure to or specific training in Cantonese, have some skills to identify errors and transcribe Cantonese. Provision of a Cantonese-adult model and information about Cantonese phonology increased students' accuracy in transcribing Cantonese speech. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
Literacy as a Leisure Activity: Free-Time Preferences of Older Children and Young Adolescents.,"Purpose: Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in school-age children and adolescents. For example, by reading a variety of books, magazines, and newspapers, students gain exposure to complex vocabulary, and reading becomes a prime opportunity for learning new words. Despite the importance of reading for lexical development, little is known about the pleasure reading habits of today's youth. The first goal of this investigation was to examine the preferences of older children and young adolescents with respect to reading as a leisure-time activity and its relationship to other free-time options that are likely to compete for their attention. The second goal was to examine the amount of time that young people spend reading for pleasure each day and the types of materials they most enjoy reading. The third goal was to determine if preferences for free-time activities and reading materials would evince age-and gender-related differences during the period of development from late childhood through early adolescence (ages 11-15 years). The findings could serve as a reference point for understanding what is reasonable to expect of students during this age range. Method: The participants were 100 sixth graders (mean age = 11;7 [years;months]) and 100 ninth graders (mean age = 14;8) attending public schools in western Oregon. Each group contained an equal number of boys and girls, all of whom spoke English as their primary language and were considered to be typical achievers. All participants completed a survey concerning their preferred free-time activities and reading materials. They also reported the average amount of time they spent reading for pleasure each day. Results: The most popular free-time activities were listening to music/going to concerts, watching television or videos, playing sports, and playing computer or video games. Least preferred activities were cooking, running or walking, writing, and arts and crafts. Reading was moderately popular. The most popular reading materials were magazines, novels, and comics; least popular were plays, technical books, and newspapers. Interest in pleasure reading declined during this age range (11-15 years), and boys were more likely than girls to report that they spent no time reading for pleasure. Clinical Implications: Given the importance of reading to lexical development in school-age children and adolescents, reading should be promoted as a leisure activity during these years. School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs), in their role as language consultants, can benefit from understanding the pleasure-reading patterns of today's youth. It is especially important for SLPs to monitor these patterns in students who have language disorders, as it is common for these young people to experience deficits in reading and in lexical development. Fortunately, much can be done in school settings to encourage strong literacy habits in all students if SLPs work collaboratively with teachers, principals, psychologists, librarians, parents, and students. Suggestions are offered for ways to encourage young people to spend more time reading for pleasure. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.",0
"Caregivers' suffix frequencies and suffix acquisition by language impaired, late talking, and typically developing children.","Acquisition of regular inflectional suffixes is an integral part of grammatical development in English and delayed acquisition of certain inflectional suffixes is a hallmark of language impairment. We investigate the relationship between input frequency and grammatical suffix acquisition, analyzing 217 transcripts of mother-child (ages 1; 11-6 9) conversations from the CHILDES database. Maternal suffix frequency correlates with previously reported rank orders of acquisition and with child suffix frequency. Percentages of children using a suffix are consistent with frequencies in caregiver speech. Although late talkers acquire suffixes later than typically developing children, order of acquisition is similar across populations. Furthermore, the third person singular and past tense verb suffixes, weaknesses for children with language impairment, are less frequent in caregiver speech than the plural noun suffix, a relative strength in language impairment. Similar findings hold across typical, SLI and late talker populations, suggesting that frequency plays a role in suffix acquisition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
"Observing young children's creative thinking: engagement, involvement and persistence.","This paper looks at young children's creative thinking as inferred through observations of their activities. A total of 52 episodes of child-initiated and adult-initiated activities in 3- to 4-year-olds in an English Children's Centre were analysed using the Analysing Children's Creative Thinking (ACCT) Framework. Results showed that activities such as gardening and construction were as valuable for supporting creative thinking as ones traditionally associated with creativity, for example, music and painting. Outdoor play of all kinds and socio-dramatic play were particularly effective contexts. All adults played a significant role in facilitating children's initial engagement in activities, and at supporting their speculative thinking and use of prior knowledge. Teachers were often more successful than other adults in supporting the acquisition of new knowledge. Child-initiated activities featured the highest levels of involvement, and were associated with trying out and analysing ideas, flexibility and originality, imagining and hypothesising. This was particularly evident in group or pair play. Children were also more persistent in child-initiated activities. Evidence of risk-taking behaviour was low, although more apparent in child-initiated activities than adult-initiated activities, or activities in which adults were present. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",0
The Use of Labels to Describe Pitch Changes by Bilingual Children.,"This study assessed the ability of first-grade bilingual children, who speak both Spanish and English, to label two-octave pitch shifts in a musical context. Prior to testing, children were asked to describe extreme changes in pitch and loudness using their preexisting vocabulary. In both languages, children were significantly more accurate in their application of terminology to describe changes in loudness than changes in pitch. Following the pre-test, children received training in the use of the English and Spanish pitch terms “high/low” and “agudo/grave.” Finally, children were asked to verbalize pitch changes heard in a familiar song that contained randomly placed 2-octave register shifts-using any of the previously learned pitch labels (English and/or Spanish). Children who responded in English were significantly faster to respond than those who chose Spanish. However, verbalizations were applied more accurately in Spanish than English.

Toward tense as a clinical marker of specific language impairment in English-speaking children.,"A critical clinical issue is the identification of a clinical marker, a linguistic form or principle that can be shown to be characteristic of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI).  In this paper we evaluate, as candidate clinical markers, a set of morphemes that mark Tense.  In English, this includes -s third person singular, -ed regular past, BE, and DO.  According to the Extended Optional Infinitive Account (EOI) of Rice, Wexler, and Cleave (1995), this set of morphemes is likely to appear optionally in the grammars of children with SLI at a rate lower than the optionality evident in younger controls.  Three groups of preschool children participated: 37 children with SLI, and two control groups, one of 40 MLU-equivalent children and another of 45 age-equivalent children.  Three kinds of evidence support the conclusion that a set of morphemes that marks Tense can be considered a clinical marker:  (a) low levels of accuracy for the target morphemes for the SLI group relative to either of the two control groups; (b) affectedness for the set of morphemes defined by the linguistic function of Tense, but not for morphemes unrelated to Tense; and (c) a bimodal distribution for Tense-marking morphemes relative to age peers, in which the typical children are at essentially adult levels of the grammar, whereas children in the SLI group were at low (i.e., non-adultlike) levels of performance.  The clinical symptoms are evident in omissions of surface forms.  Errors of subject-verb agreement and syntactic misuses are rare, showing that, as predicted, children in an EOI stage who are likely to mark Tense optionally at the same time know a great deal about the grammatical properties of finiteness and agreement in the adult grammar.  The findings are discussed in terms of alternative accounts of the grammatical limitations of children with SLI and implications for clinical identification.

The acquisition of plural marking in English and German revisited: schemata versus rules.,"A study examined whether the acquisition of plural marking in English and German is rule-based or whether the assumption of pattern association is more adequate to account for the facts.  The research of Berko (1958), Mugdan (1977), and Baker and Derwing (1982) was reanalyzed.  Results suggested that their interpretation of zero responses had only partial validity.  Results showed that children were clearly sensitive to the extent to which stimuli approximated high cue strength plural schemata, even when this was only a weak approximation, but with Mugdan's data, this observation was less remarkable.  The observation was all the more remarkable with regard to the English research, which suggests that, underlying the ultimate establishment of item and process rules in the speaker's linguistic competence, there may be a schema-learning mechanism that guides the sorting out of singular and plural lexical forms and the acquisition of plural morphology.",0
Specific language impairment as a period of extended optional infinitive.,"English-speaking children with specific language impairment (SLI) are known to have particular difficulty with the acquisition of grammatical morphemes that carry tense and agreement features, such as the past tense -ed and third-person singular present -s.  In this study, an Extended Optional Infinitive (EOI) account of SLI is evaluated.  In this account, -ed, -s, BE, and DO are regarded as finiteness markers.  This model predicts that finiteness markers are omitted for an extended period of time for nonimpaired children, and that this period will be extended for a longer time in children with SLI.  At the same time, it predicts that if finiteness markers are present, they will be used correctly.  These predictions are tested in this study.  Subjects were 18 5-year-old children with SLI with expressive and receptive language deficits and two comparison groups of children developing language normally:  22 CA-equivalent (5N) and 20 younger, MLU-equivalent children (3N).  It was found that the children with SLI used nonfinite forms of lexical verbs, or omitted BE and DO, more frequently than children in the 5N and 3N groups.  At the same time, like the normally developing children, when the children with SLI marked finiteness, they did so appropriately.  Most strikingly, the SLI group was highly accurate in marking agreement on BE and DO forms.  The findings are discussed in terms of the predictions of the EOI model, in comparison to other models of the grammatical limitations of children with SLI.

Fired up by poetry.,"The Free Spirit National Poetry and Song Competition is a competition for poems and songs in foreign languages that is open to students aged 11–18 at middle and secondary schools in Great Britain.  Entries for the 2003 competition showed how young people can compose verses in a foreign language, even though they do not possess the extensive vocabulary in that language and the subtle awareness of its nuances that are usually associated with poetry.",0
Aesop's fables (Discis books),"The CD-ROM Aesop's Fables ($49.95), from Discis Knowledge Research Inc., includes ten stories of three to five pages in length.  The package is intended for older elementary students, but the teacher would need to examine the suitability of the vocabulary used.  The addition of music and sound effects and the existence of a mouse make the disc suitable for students with either visual impairments, learning disabilities, or severe motor impairments.  The package contains readings in both Spanish and English.",0
Poetry prompts: The mouse.,"The text of a poem about a mouse is provided.  With this poem, children's enjoyment of rhyming words can be used to enhance their reading skills and vocabulary.  Activities for English, math, science, art/physical education, and music classes are provided.",0
Cat came back.,"The Cat Came Back ($59.95), from Sanctuary Woods Multimedia Corporation, is a CD-ROM that is based on the story and traditional song about Old Mr. Johnson and the pesky yellow cat who just does not want to leave.  It is designed to facilitate second-language learning and pronunciation, encourage students' musical development, and help children in elementary grades to improve their reading ability, enlarge their vocabulary, and practice creative writing.",0
"The Use of Singing, Storytelling and Chanting in the Primary EFL Classroom: Aesthetic Experience and Participation in FL Learning","This longitudinal small-scale study, which is based on data collected between 2007 and 2010in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany, analyses the use of songs, stories and chants in primaryEFL classrooms. A multi-method design is applied involving quantitative researchinstruments, such as a questionnaire distributed to primary school teachers, as well asqualitative research instruments, such as extensive participant observation and in-depthinterviews with learners as well as teachers.Questionnaire data indicates regular use of songs, stories and chants in primary FLclassrooms in the area under investigation. Audio-recorded classroom and interview discoursereveals that musical and literary texts spark learners’ interest due to the aesthetic qualities theyexhibit. Learners’ non-verbal and verbal responses show that they construct meaning fromvisual and acoustic cues that accompany songs, stories and chants and that they are eager toparticipate in the performance of these texts. Learners imitate language items immediately,their verbal participation increasing with every encounter of a song, chant or story. Learnersare able to recall individual and multi-word sequences from high-interest musical and literarytexts shortly after repeated exposure as well as 12 to 15 months later. There is evidence ofthem breaking up memorized language chunks and recombining them for generative languageuse. Furthermore, learners are able to jointly reconstruct the storyline of a picture book 12months after their first and only encounter with it, suggesting that a meaningful context hasbeen created which is accessible over an extended period of time.On the basis of these findings, it is argued that the aesthetic qualities of songs, storiesand chants foster FL learning in various ways. They support comprehension and retrieval,sustain learners’ interest and invite joint performances, all of which paves the way for themastery of multi-word sequences and creative FL use.",1
Rhythmic perception and entrainment in 5-year-old children,"Phonological awareness is an important component of early literacy and many children struggle to master its key elements, such as the ability to hear syllables and rhymes within the speech stream. The hypothesis explored within this study is that since music and language have parallel auditory perceptual mechanisms then training in rhythmic activities, such as music, could lead to increased understanding of the rhythmic nature required to decode early language and literacy skills. Previous research investigating the relationship between the constructs of music perception and phonological awareness has been promising, but generally inconclusive. Within the study I examine whether there is a link between the temporal processing required to process rhythmic entrainment in both phonological awareness skills and music. The data are interpreted with respect to a theoretical framework linking music and language based on temporal sampling. The ‘temporal sampling theory’ (Goswami, 2011) suggests that the decoding of both language and music is linked to the perception of accent and beat, and that the ability to hear the onset of these accents is critical within a stream of auditory events. To this end rhythmic entrainment tasks were presented in a range of musical activities including drumming along to music and singing nursery songs and rhymes. The musical and rhythmic activities were given in several different forms, to see which would be most effective in showing the children’s ability to synchronise to a beat. These were all presented at four pulse rates (400 ms, 500 ms, 666 ms, 1000 ms). Data were collected over a period of 2 years commencing in November 2009. In Study1 93 4 and 5-year-old children were tested and in Study 2 data were collected from a further 99. In addition to psychometric tests for IQ, Word Recall, teachers from the schools provided information from the children’s Foundation Stage profiles. Phonological awareness skills (syllable and rhyme) were also measured, as was reading development. Overall, children showed greater temporal accuracy (rhythmic entrainment) in keeping time with a musical piece than in keeping time with a metronome. Entrainment accuracy was greatest at the 500 ms rate, the only rate for which entrainment was as accurate with music and metronome. Individual differences in rhythmic entrainment whilst drumming were not linked to I.Q. Children were more temporally accurate when singing than in the rhythmic entrainment tasks and temporal accuracy at pulse rates of 500 ms (2 Hz) and 666 ms (1.5 Hz) showed some significant links to rhyme awareness and to reading. Temporal accuracy in singing a rhyming word on time was also greatest at 500 ms, although simply singing along to music did not show a preferred rate. Unexpectedly, temporal accuracy in singing was linked to I.Q., and was not linked independently to syllable and rhyme awareness. However, temporal accuracy in singing at the 500 ms rate was linked to reading. In Sample 2 of the PhD I report on the results of a seven-week three group matched intervention study of 99 children. The intervention was designed to investigate whether a short intervention of either music or ‘rhythmic speech’ based around the preferred rate of 500ms would lead to improved phonological awareness skills. Group 1 was given a programme of music games and songs, and group 2 was given a matched programme of games and ‘rhythmic speech’, without musical accompaniment or singing, to promote syllable and rhyme awareness. A third group, who received no additional training acted as a control. The results show that an intervention based on rhythmic structure in either a rhythmic speech form or in musical form can be successful in improving children’s phonological awareness skills. The rhythmic speech programme proved to be a more successful vehicle than the music intervention in improving the phonological skills of this group of 90 children. Both interventions were successful in improving both rhyme and syllable awareness, but the greatest improvements came in the syllable tests. There was further evidence that an intervention in either rhythmic speech or music would impact on the children’s future reading skills. Both interventions produced significantly higher correlations with a Word Reading test than the control group. There was no evidence to suggest that a musical intervention based on tapping along to a beat was of more benefit than one based on rhythmic speech. Overall the evidence gathered from the data in this study does suggest that there are direct links between rhythmic awareness, as measured by tapping to an isochronous beat, and the children’s capacity to decode phonological information. The favoured rate at which the brain processes information in both domains, thus linking them together, is at a pulse rate with an Inter Onset Interval set to 500ms. This study’s results could be used to support the development of rhythmic based interventions, in both a rhythmic speech and musical form in support of early literacy skills in 4 and 5 –year –old children.",1
"[""The Development and the Effects of an English Phonics Program linked with Phonological Awareness for Young Children in an EFL Context"", ""음운인식과 연계한 유아영어 파닉스 프로그램의 개발 및 효과""]","The purpose of this study is to develop a phonics program suitable for 5-year old children learning English in South Korea in connection with phonological awareness. While children who learn English in South Korea have less awareness of English phonology compared to children who learn English as their native language, they have some awareness of  phonology and phonics skills in Korean. Based on the results of recent studies on cross language transfer, phonological awareness and phonics activities in Korean are also performed in parallel. Sixteen lessons were given to 26 five-year old children. Short animations and chants about the 26 alphabet letters, nursery rhymes, and picture books both in English and in Korean were used. Test results of students’  phonics skills, phonological awareness, and reading skills after the program were compared to before the program. This study concluded that children’s phonics, phonological awareness, and word reading improved significantly. In the post-test, While the success rate in the task of the phonics and the phonological awareness reached 70% and 80%, the children could read successfully only 22% of the words. The results of this study and of the children’s responses in the lessons were discussed in relation to previous studies.     PU  - The Research Institue of Korean Education",1
ASL Nursery Rhymes: Exploring a Support for Early Language and Emergent Literacy Skills for Signing Deaf Children,"Nursery rhymes in American Sign Language (ASL) can be used in parent-infant and early childhood programs to support early acquisition of sign language, ASL literacy, and emergent English literacy. As a form of children's ASL literature, ASL nursery rhymes manipulate the abstract, sublexical, or phonological structure of signs to provide children with playful language experiences. As such, these rhymes provide early sign language phonological awareness, which allows Deaf1 children to develop ASL vocabulary to bridge to English words as well as a vehicle to segment printed letters when reading words. This paper aims to: (1) provide an overview of the benefits of nursery rhymes; (2) compare the structure of English and ASL nursery rhymes; (3) describe how ASL nursery rhymes support ASL and English literacy, encouraging language play and thus reducing linguistic neglect; (4) describe studies showing benefits of ASL rhymes; and (5) provide implications for practitioners.

LITERACY EVENTS IN ENGLISH CLASSES OF A RURAL PRESCHOOL,"An engaging learning environment is vital for successful mastery of reading and writing skills of young children. This study investigated the literacy events that occurred in the English classes of five-year old children from a Chinese preschool in a rural area. Teachers were interviewed, audio and videotaped during English lessons over a period of five months to offer a closer look on interactions between preschool children and their teachers to assess the effectiveness of the pedagogical approach of teachers. Interviews too provided supporting details necessary for the research. Data collected from the interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. The analysis of the data shows that literacy events during the English classes involved mainly the teaching of phonics and vocabulary using the MELS program. Most of the time, students were asked to read words and memorize spellings of words at home for tests after a few days. At times, students were asked to write out each word taught several times, a task aimed at improving their ability to spell accurately. Recitation of Nursery rhymes and storytelling, two common interactive practices in preschool classes, were totally absent in class. Students were rarely asked to read aloud in class and this resulted in the lack of practice in sight-reading of longer sentences in class. Due to the teacher-centered approach adopted in class, students were hardly engaged or motivated. Clearly, there is a need for intervention to bring about greater motivation and consequently a more satisfactory environment for the acquisition of basic reading and writing skills.

"[""A study on the development of remedial teaching and learning materials in the primary English education"", ""초등영어 보정교육 자료 개발 연구""]","A strong concern has been expressed over the increasing number of students with learning difficulties and their being left behind in the primary English education. The government proposed a strategic plan, No Child Below-Basic, which provides remedial instruction with materials especially designed for children with learning difficulties. The present research aimed to develop remedial teaching and learning material to help children with literacy problem at the primary English classroom. Literature review and a survey and in-depth interviews were conducted to find out what teachers’ needs were in the remedial education. The findings from the survey and interviews revealed that access to remedial materials is limited and teacher support is needed as well as material development. To accommodate the needs, the remedial materials were developed according to six steps: letter recognition, phonemic awareness, phonics, sight words, vocabulary, and comprehension. At the first step, a variety of activities are provided to help children recognize the alphabet. The phonics level includes a variety of activities to recognize how sounds are related to spelling. At the sight words step, children learn 300 sight words including the most frequently used function words. Then, a list of basic vocabulary is presented according to themes with a variety of activities, including the primary-level words proposed in the national curriculum. At the comprehension level, reading materials are sequenced from nursery rhymes to stories.     PU  - Pan-Korea English Teachers Association",0
The influence of prosodic input in the second language classroom: does it stimulate child acquisition of word order and function words?,"This paper reports on an intervention study with young Polish beginners (mean age: 8 years, 3 months) learning English at school. It seeks to identify whether exposure to rhythmic input improves knowledge of word order and function words. The 'prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis', relevant in developmental psycholinguistics, provided the theoretical framework for the study. Eighty-seven children were randomly assigned to a treatment group exposed to rhythm-salient input in the form of nursery rhymes, a comparison group exposed to prose input, or a control group with no extra input. Results established that prosody can be an important factor in second language acquisition, as in first language acquisition. Children in the treatment group showed improvement in metalinguistic knowledge of English word order but not of function words. This has implications for teaching methods and classroom materials.

"Making a Difference: English Learning, ICT and the School Library Hand-in-Hand","Teaching English as a foreign language to students who are 8 to 11 years old (especially when you are used to working with teenagers) can be really challenging, but also highly rewarding. You must definitely leave your ""comfort zone"" and risk new approaches. Introducing ICT in the scenario and making use of the school library space conditions and resources (books, iPads, digital tools) can lead to countless ideas and initiatives, which arise gradually as time goes by and imagination takes the lead. As an English teacher and librarian teacher of a joint group of schools in the centre of Portugal, I developed this project with about 100 primary school students (plus 20 kindergarten children), in the course of two school years (2016-2018). The project became ""Merit Idea 2016"", supported by the Portuguese School Libraries Network. Not to lose its dynamics, it has been reconfigured and further developed with the previous primary students, later attending the 5th (2018/2019) and 6th grades (2019/2020).In this project, ICT tools are not an END, but a MEANS to learn English and become digitally (cap)able in a modern world. English children's books and other school library resources are also great instruments to develop one's vocabulary, pleasure in reading, creativity, sense of citizenship and opinion about the world. Songs, nursery rhymes, videos, English apps and games are also on the core of this project, which I consider worth spreading to other teachers around the world. A lot of effort, but also a lot of pleasure, are definitely involved in the process. There were steps forward and some backwards, but motivation to learn a foreign language and the pleasure of playing and sharing were/are always present in the English classes.

How the Use of Music and Movement Impacts the Learning of Reading Skills by Preschoolers,"The preschool years are considered the 'prime time' for children to develop physically, socially, cognitively, and linguistically. The most critical issue in current education is the poor development of reading skills among children. Research indicates that integrating music into children's daily activities promotes literacy development, particularly with English language learners. Unfortunately, music is not emphasised in Malaysian government preschools, as music teachers lack the appropriate knowledge and teaching skills. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of music and movement on the reading skills of 40 five-year-old preschoolers at a university preschool. This study sought to evaluate three reading skills or subtests - Print Knowledge, Definitional Vocabulary, and Phonological Awareness. The intervention comprised musical activities that included songs or singing nursery rhymes with body movements. This quasi-experimental design utilised the Test of Preschool Early Literacy which measures early literacy skills for preschoolers. The results showed that music and movement activities impacted preschoolers in their overall reading skills (p = .02), print knowledge (p = .005), and definitional vocabulary (p = .03) after the intervention, but did not impact on their phonological awareness skills (p = .18). These findings confirmed that music and movement enhanced literacy skills for a duration of six weeks. Many opportunities should be included for children so that they can be thoroughly engaged in music and literacy activities. Teachers should be equipped with sufficient skills and knowledge and also implement a high-quality music programme to develop effective reading skills.

Phonological Awareness in German-Speaking 3-Year-Olds - A Pilot Study,"Background: Phonological awareness (PA) is an important metalinguistic skill which is closely linked to language acquisition. The aim of the study was therefore to assess PA in 3-year-old children.Method: 33 monolingual German-speaking children aged 3;6-3;11 were assessed. Different syllable-and onset-rhyme-tasks were administered.Results: In general, test scores showed high variability. The majority of children successfully completed the syllable awareness tasks (84.8, 97 and 100 % above chance level). Results for the onset-rhyme tasks varied considerably. Most children were able to complete verbally presented nursery rhymes (90.9 % above chance) and to blend onset-rhymes into words (63.3 and 72.9 %, respectively). However, the identification of rhymes (if presented with semantic and phonological distractors) and the production of rhyme words were difficult for many of the children (21.2 and 15.1 %, respectively).Discussion: Our results underpin the assumption that PA is already present at the age of 3 years. Implicit PA skills at syllable level are observable and a considerable number of children are able to successfully complete rhyme awareness tasks. The performance levels seem partly dependent on task demands and instructions.     PU  - GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG     PI  - STUTTGART     PA  - RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0
"Songs, stories, and vocabulary acquisition in preschool learners of English as a foreign language","Songs and stories are regarded as popular and effective resources in the preschool classroom, but questions remain as to what effect each has on incidental vocabulary acquisition when Spanish preschool children learn English as a foreign language (EFL). This study investigates the effects that listening to stories, songs and the combination of both have on EFL vocabulary growth. One group of children (N = 17) aged two and three years old were exposed to 15 target words embedded in one story, one song, and the combination of a story and a song. Descriptive measures were employed, as well as a one-way repeated measures ANOVA test with Time and Condition as intra-subject factors; video recordings were also conducted in order to check for behavioural learning patterns. Results indicate that the Story condition yielded the highest scores, while the Song condition was the least effective. Implications are taken into consideration for content planning and incidental vocabulary learning in preschool EFL contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

POSSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES IN TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES USING CHILDREN'S LITERATURE TO ELEMENTARY STUDENTS IN AN AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAM,"This article describes how foreign languages can be taught to elementary students using Krashen's (2003) comprehensible input framework. Krashen posits that students learn best when they understand the target language as supported by their native language. Guided by this hypothesis, we developed and designed a program integrating bilingual children's literature to engage and teach students Spanish and French. Challenges in implementing the foreign language afterschool program included issues regarding time constraints and student-teacher ratio in a multigrade-level class. On the other hand, the possibilities of using children's literature to teach foreign languages in a meaningful way outweighed the issues we encountered. Using bilingual children's literature to teach native English speakers Spanish and French enabled us to bridge foreign language teaching and second language acquisition in a purposeful way. Among the benefits of the foreign language afterschool program includes elementary students understanding and using Spanish and French greetings, basic conversation, simple phrases, and songs while also learning in the company of other children.

"[""Development and application of an English instructional model based on a rhythmic pattern in a middle school. Modern English Education"", ""중학교 영어 리듬 패턴 교수Â·학습 모형 개발 및 적용""]","The goal of this study is to develop and apply an English instructional model using poetic language with rhythmic patterns. Poetic language as learning materials in the EFL classroom has repetitive rhythms, which make patterns. These rhythmic patterns are known to be helpful for memory, contributing to language acquisition. In this study, the instructional model was applied to the students of two classes in S middle school for 10 periods. The experimental group was given an instructional model that deals with poetic materials in the textbook, whereas the control group was given a traditional method that treats the same materials in the textbook. The poetic materials were found in the sources like nursery rhymes, children’s poems and songs, etc. The students’ cognitive and affective ability was measured by a diagnostic test for English and an affective test developed by the researchers. The test result was analyzed by the independent samples t-test. As a result, it showed that the students that used the poetic model improved in both the cognitive and affective domain. Likewise, the data from class observation sheets and students’ after-class response sheets showed a positive result. The study proves that the instructional model, which focuses on learning with poetic language with rhythmic patterns, is efficient in developing middle-school students’ English ability.

Professional Learning through Coaching: toward the Enhancement of the Teachers' Pedagogical Competence,"Coaching is mainly purposed to build teacher capacity to enhance the success of learning and the quality of education in general. This paper is aimed at describing the coaching materials, methods, and the effectiveness of coaching in English Foreign Language (EFL) learning to strengthen the teachers' pedagogical competence. Six Junior High School EFL teachers of Central Java, Indonesia (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6) attended three-month weekly coachee-centered coaching leading to the implementation of student-centered learning. Observation of the teaching-learning process, review of the lesson plan, and an interview with the EFL teachers through Focus Group Discussion were done before coaching was carried out to identify the coachees' preliminary pedagogical competence and needs. The coaching materials encompassed using songs in EFL class, learning principles and activity-based learning, teaching methods, teaching vocabulary, teaching grammar, teaching the four language skills, assessing attitude, knowledge, and skill, and process skills. Coachee-centered coaching was implemented to present the materials through such methods as Demonstration, Scientific Approach, Lecturing and Discussion, Problem-Based Learning, Task-Based Learning, Inquiry Learning, Presentation-Practice-Production.

"[""A Qualitative Analysis of the Role of Music in Second Language Learning of Preschool ESL Students"", ""미국 유치원 ESL학생들의 영어학습을 위한 음악사용 사례연구""]","For ESL learners, preschool is likely the first time they are completely immersed into an English-speaking environment. Methods of teaching English as a second language are qualitatively examined with teachers from four preschool/kindergarten classrooms at a school whose majority of students come from households where English is not the primary spoken language.Teacher questionnaires, interviews, and classroom observations reveal multiple roles music has in the preschool context, such as creating a classroom environment where learning is promoted, capturing students’ attention, making learning fun and interesting, and improving aspects of language acquisition and comprehension. Teachers’ limited teaching and musical experience are not indicative of their frequency of music use in language learning. In fact, most teachers are comfortable with including music into activities despite their lack of musical background and offered no external barriers that prohibit their use of music.Implications include creating professional development specifically aimed at effective uses of music in second language acquisition and developing ready-to-use resources that are accessible to teachers regardless of their background and experience. The potential transfer of application of music on the adult learning population is also of importance.     PU  - The Society For Korean Music",1

A group of Basque/Spanish speakers (n = 117) and a group of Spanish speakers (n = 70) divided into three proficiency levels (elementary, intermediate and advanced) completed two written (a fill in the gap task and a written description task) two oral production tasks (an oral elicitation and a picture description). Our findings show that previous linguistic knowledge and proficiency level in English seem to have an influence on the type of errors attested in the L2 and the L3 groups.

Investigating Indonesian EFL Learners' Learning and Acquiring English Vocabulary,"The process of how EFL learners' learning and acquiring English vocabulary has become the popular issue since English has considered as an International language in Indonesian schools. In this study, the researchers focused on verifying learners' strategy in enhancing their English vocabulary. This study was quantitative research that employed longitudinal survey. The subject of this study was learners of junior high school in Parepare. The data gained through questioner, which was distributed to 100 students at the junior high school in Parepare. The findings indicated that the EFL learners' strategy in learning English vocabulary such as doing the assignment, practicing English pronunciation, learning English tenses, practicing English dialogue, English translation exercise, reading English text, memorizing and writing practice. In addition, the Indonesian EFL learners acquired English vocabulary through the dictionary, reading English book, listening to and watching English songs and movies, playing the game, the internet, and reading English advertisement.

The effect of the use of English media on English vocabulary acquisition: an empirical study with Flemish youngsters,"Several experimental studies have demonstrated the short term effects of watching foreign language television on children and youngsters' foreign language skills. This article reports on an empirical study in which the long term effects of media use on vocabulary acquisition were tested. In the study, the self-reported use of English language media Of 374 Flemish pupils in the last year of primary education was compared with their scores on an oral English vocabulary test. The analyses of variance reveal that pupils who frequently watch subtitled English television programmes and films perform significantly better on the vocabulary test. While listening to English music does not seem to significantly influence the size of the pupils' vocabulary, it does have a positive impact on the level of difficulty of the lexical items learned (i.e. the proportion items not cognate to the Dutch equivalent). The same applies to playing English computer games, albeit only with male pupils.     PU  - UITGEVERIJ BOOM BV     PI  - AMSTERDAM     PA  - PRINSENGRACHT 747-751, AMSTERDAM, 1017 JX, NETHERLANDS",0
Music videos in primary English class for the improvement of reading fluency,"Reading is a key skill in any type of learning process. Spanish students' results are low in national and international assessment scales. Reading processes are complex and the skill transferences between languages are not always positive. This action-research study analyses a fourth primary students' population with Spanish as the language of schooling and English as a foreign language. The research instruments used were phonemic awareness, literacy and vocabulary tests. It is shown that, when a reading intervention programme is carried out with English subtitled musical videos, phonemic awareness improves as sounds, prosodic elements and vocabulary are practiced. Students improve their reading fluency, text comprehension and their learning motivation.

Self-efficacy and Anxiety in Learning English as a Foreign Language: Singing in Class Helps Speaking Performance,"Learning is a process that involves both cognitive and affective components and that requires appropriate educational strategies. The present study investigates the links between self-efficacy and anxiety in second language learning, and the effectiveness of the singing songs teaching strategy upon students' speaking performance. In particular, we tested whether singing songs in class during English lessons affects the relationship between self-efficacy, anxiety and performance in a group of Italian high school students learning English as a second language (N = 132; age ranging 16-19 years). The data were collected through a production task in which the vocabulary extension, the number of words, and the fluency of speech were coded and calculated as a general indicator of students' linguistic competence. In addition, students were asked about their use of singing as an educational activity during English lessons. Results of bootstrapping analyses confirmed our prediction that foreign language self-efficacy is correlated to performance, through the mediation of anxiety. Our results also showed that the use of a singing songs strategy moderates the association of low self-efficacy to anxiety and performance, thus suggesting its plausibility as a positive pedagogical tool in second language learning activities. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.     PU  - EDIZIONI UNIV LETTERE ECONOMIA DIRITTO-LED     PI  - MILAN     PA  - VIA CERVIGNANO 4, MILAN, 00000, ITALY",0
A blended collaborative writing approach for Chinese L2 primary school students,"This paper outlines an adaptable collaborative writing approach employing a wiki to address the typical weaknesses of young Singaporean Chinese students learning Chinese as second language (L2) in Chinese writing. These students' problems in writing include limited and incorrect use of vocabulary, English-style grammar, badly structured passages, and so on. The collaborative writing approach, V.S.P.O.W., can be characterised as a recursive, bottom-up writing process that requires the students to collaboratively carry out wiki-based ""word/phrase pooling"" (V), ""sentence making"" (S), ""paragraph writing"" (P), and ""outlining"" (O); and eventually individual essay writing (W). We analysed the potential learning effects of the writing process among Primary 4 (10-year-old) students - especially in addressing and leveraging students' individual differences. Through teacher and student-initiated customisation of the original V.S.P.O.W. process, we hope to improve the students' micro-skills for writing. The results of the pilot study show that the target students' micro-skills for writing were significantly improved, which could be attributed to emerging peer coaching practices among them.

Foreign Language Teaching Within 4+4+4 Education System in Turkey: Language Teachers' Voices,"Problem Statement: In 2012 Ministry of National Education in Turkey has revised the education system so that the new 4+4+4 system requires a three-tier model of education with primary, secondary, and high school components. As with many changes in the curriculum, foreign language (FL) teaching has also been changed and the starting age for learning a FL has been lowered to 6.6 years of age (second grade). As one of the parties of the education process, teachers' views about this curriculum change and their understanding of teaching English to young learners (TEYL) have great importance.Purpose of Study: The current research aims to investigate English teachers' ideas towards the starting age for FL learning, how it should be conducted with young learners, and finally what their current practices are when teaching children.Methods: The data for the study is gathered from 203 primary school English teachers from seven different regions of Turkey via a questionnaire consisting of three parts concerning the aforementioned issues. The first part has closed and open-ended questions and aims at finding teachers views about the starting age/grade for language learning. Second part investigates teachers' beliefs about TEYL and third part investigates teachers' classroom implementations while teaching YLs. The reliability is taken for each part of the questionnaire. As a result, all sections of the questionnaire are found reliable with alpha values .758, .796, and .806 consecutively. Frequency analysis, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and ANOVA were used to make the analysis.Findings and Results: The results indicate that teachers prefer language education to start at the first stage of primary school and even earlier during pre-school. Pertaining to teacher's beliefs about TEYL, most of the teachers revealed that FL teaching in primary school should be mainly based on listening and speaking rather than grammar; within a context through visual/kinesthetic activities, songs, and games rather than worksheets. However, the Wilcoxon signed rank test results revealed that there are significant differences between the participants' beliefs and their implementation.Conclusions and Recommendations: Consequently, teachers are in favor of the recent changes in the curriculum; however, some teachers might need some in-service training regarding the use of appropriate techniques with YLs. These in-service training courses should involve practical tips to implement theoretically sound language teaching to children. Contribution and understanding of teachers, parents, and other educational institutions/organizations should be supported for a successful implementation of a language policy.

"[""A Study on the Effect of Music on English Education"", ""음악이 영어 교육에 주는 효율성 연구""]","This study examines the effect of music education, in particular musical aptitude and music training, as factors relevant to the prediction of success on English or foreign language learning. The studies reviewed in this study reveal that there is indeed a correlation between music and English or foreign language learning. This correlation between music training and second language acquisition appears to be lower for adults than for children; the playing of a musical instrument does not appear to modify an adult's second or foreign language learning (Lowe 1998, Harrison 1979, Eterno 1961). Conversely, listening and singing in the language studies appear to promote the learning of pronunciation in English or a foreign language for both adults and children(Tomatis 1991, Anton1990). Therefore, not only is there a possible relationship between musical aptitude and English phonetic learning, but also between musical training and English phonetic learning. On the basis of this study, it is evident that musical aptitude and musical training are important factors in English or foreign language pronunciation success, especially for children.

"[""Developing an English Musical Course for Pre-service Elementary School Teachers"", ""교대생들을 위한 영어뮤지컬 지도법 수업모형 개발""]","The purpose of this study is to investigate ways to improve an English musical theater course for pre-service elementary school teachers. To achieve the objective, an English musical course was offered to 15 undergraduate students at a national university of education for one semester, in 2014. Then a survey and two open-ended questionnaires were conducted for the students who took the course. The data were analyzed based on the observation of the researcher, who taught the musical course, and the in-depth interview of the three students among the subjects. The primary results of this study are as follows. First, the content of the course needs a balance between the teaching methods of English musicals and the production of English musicals. In other words, the main content of the musical course should focus on the performance English musicals after writing scripts and creating songs and dances. In addition, pre-service teachers need to learn how to use English musicals for elementary school children while studying the English musical teaching materials specifically developed for Korean EFL children. Second, literature-based musical movies should be used to meet the needs of the pre-service teachers who want to improve their listening skills and learn high-level vocabulary and grammar. Also, through studying and singing the lyrics of the songs in the musical movies, they can improve their English pronunciation. Third, regarding the recommended teaching procedures, for the first five weeks students can improve their English skills through musical movies that fit their level of English proficiency and learn how to use English musicals for children through reviewing children’s English musicals. For the next four weeks, they can write a musical script and create songs and dances. For the last five weeks, they can focus on practice and perform their own creative English musial. The results of this study are expected to serve as practical material for per-service teacher trainers who plan to organize an English musical theater course to promote students’ creativity and character as well as their English skills.

"Musical aptitude, working memory, general intelligence and plurilingualism: When adults learn to read fluently in a foreign language","Studies over the past two decades have provided relevant data on the relationship between music and reading abilities although they fundamentally refer to aspects of the first language reading process of young children. The foreign language reading acquisition process of adult learners has, in this sense, been less explored. Research in this area refers to working memory as a ""common cognitive marker"" for musical aptitude and reading ability, but little is known about the relationship between musical aptitude and silent reading fluency of adult foreign language learners, the hallmark of skilled readers. Specifically, this study seeks to determine whether musical aptitude as well as cognitive factors such as working memory, general intelligence and plurilingualism could contribute to the understanding of adults' silent reading abilities in a foreign language. For this purpose, thirty-eight undergraduates, native speakers of German and learners of Spanish, were tested. Additionally, their FL reading comprehension level and their musical training were controlled to categorise the learners. Our data shows a strong association of musical aptitude, working memory, general intelligence and plurilingualism with learners' foreign language silent reading fluency. In addition, a multiple linear regression analysis reveals that musical aptitude and knowledge of different foreign languages influence their silent reading fluency. But when in a second linear regression the lower reading proficiency level (A2) was introduced as a controlling variable, only musical aptitude is significant. In conclusion, further studies on the silent reading capacity of adult foreign language learners need to consider abilities such as musical aptitude and plurilingualism to better understand the whole reading acquisition process.

Images as a Resource for Supporting Vocabulary Learning: A Multimodal Analysis of Thai EFL Tablet Apps for Primary School Children,"In 2011, the Thai government introduced a national project, One Tablet per Child (OTPC), with the aim of supporting students' learning in the digital world. The project commenced with Grade 1 in 2012 and Grade 2 in 2013. The applications embedded in the OTPC tablet given to each child feature multimedia teaching applications (apps) on various subjects, including English as a foreign language (EFL). Using the Grade 1 and 2 English apps as a case study, this article investigates how one section of the apps (song videos) uses images and language to create meaning and considers the potential of visual-verbal relations to support vocabulary teaching and learning. The article concludes with a discussion of related pedagogical implications for the use and design of EFL materials integrated into multimedia technologies: the critical role of teachers in guiding EFL learners' use of such materials, the need for an increased awareness of the potential and limitations of images and visual-verbal relations to support EFL teaching and learning, and understanding the relationship between the multimodal design of EFL materials and related learning outcomes at different stages of EFL learning.

First and foreign language early reading abilities: The influence of musical perception,"There is a growing body of literature that recognises how music perception affects first-language learning, but much less is known about its influence on foreign-language reading skills. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of music perception abilities on the acquisition of some foreign early reading skills based on their transference from first language. Data for this study were collected from 63 Spanish-speaking English-language learners studying second grade of primary school. We used a music perception test and the Early Grade Reading Assessment battery, which measures early reading skills in both languages. A mediation analysis using structural equation modelling was performed, integrating music perception and letter-sound knowledge, initial sound identification, and familiar word and pseudoword reading in Spanish and English. This research provides new insights into how music perception affects early reading skills in both languages. These findings indicate a transfer of music perception abilities to first-language alphabetic principle, phonemic awareness and word recognition skills that affect foreign language early reading abilities.

Using Song Lyrics in the Classroom: Assessing the Utility of Song Lyrics for the Acquistion of a Foreign Language,"This study examines the effect of the song lyrics in acquiring a foreign language. Moreover, it shows how the use of the song's lyrics, such as the lyrics of the famous songs, increases the pupils' ability to understand the spoken and written form of English, and their ability to recognize the written form of the new vocabulary. Moreover, it shows the usefulness of song lyrics in practicing grammar of the target language. Furthermore, this study examines the effect of using song lyrics in increasing pupils' motivation in learning a foreign language. The main objective of the study is not just to discover whether the lyrics of the songs have a positive effect in acquiring a foreign language, but to discover why the use of song lyrics in the classroom is effective in English language learning. To achieve this aim, twenty-three eight grade and thirty-four seven grade learners were examined so fifty-seven pupils who study English as a foreign language. This research took place in the primary school Nuri Mazari in Dollogozhda, Struga. The learners were divided into two groups, the control and the experimental group. Each group contains one eight-grade class and one seven-grade class. Both of the groups took a pre- and a post-test. At the beginning of the study, pupils took the pre-test. It examined the learners' current knowledge about English. At the end of the study, pupils took the post-test, which examined the learners' knowledge after the study took place. In this way, the learners' progress in learning English and the effect of song lyrics in pupils' motivation is more obvious. The pre-test results of the control group were a little bit higher than the experimental group. However, the results gathered from the post-test indicate that the experimental group who used song lyrics outperformed the control group who did not use song lyrics.

TEACHING SPANISH IN THE AMERICAN COLLEGE: A GLOBAL APPROACH,"Those trained to teach foreign languages with the Rassias method back in the late 1960' s and into the 1980' s, now look back and cannot help note how this method defined the approach to language pedagogy of a whole generation of teachers. After all, the Rassias method was a response to the somewhat anachronistically and ancient grammar-translation approach, which was not fully discarded or discredited then. On the other hand, the ALM (Audio-Lingual Method) approach continued to be the preferred method for foreign language teachers in high school and undergraduates college professors alike. Nevertheless, 1990' s arrives with the so-called TPR (Total Physical Response) method burring and implicitly ridiculing all previous pedagogical approaches gaining few followers.All of these varying methodologies used to impart Spanish seem to have worked in particular settings, and thus no one is in any way suggesting that they will be discarded. This paper instead is about an approach that has been working in many Spanish classrooms, and keeping all concerned parties happy: the students, the faculty, the Dean of Arts and Sciences, and even those who are profoundly terrified when it comes to fulfilling a language requirement. This method is called ""The Global Approach.""Although the implementation of the five C's (Culture, Communication, Community, Comparisons and Connections) stipulated by the National Standards is an essential part of this proposal, The Global Approach calls for a more interdisciplinary application than the National Standards in order to reach all learners. The latter also include those who experience extreme difficulty in acquiring a foreign tongue, among them many who have a documented learning disability. Based on careful observations over a period of twenty years and, after having used The Global Approach, there is enough evidence of its effectiveness. The incorporation of The Five Cs, the use of technology, music, and film, and an intense segment of culture taught in English can, and does, reach all learners in a global way. It is an approach that reflects the era of globalization and multiculturalism, with both their content and discontent realities.The inclusion of multiple areas in foundation courses comes at the price of a reduction in the amount of grammar and verb tenses taught. This is perhaps the most significant change, for it means teachers of foreign languages in general have to resign themselves to the fact that college students, after taking the requisite two or three semesters of Spanish, will only be able to communicate in two or perhaps three tenses. To compensate for this, however, students would be significantly familiarized with the music, arts, film, politics and media of a given country or countries. Even more, they would be trained to describe simple thoughts with simple vocabulary in the target language. Since most of the focus on stultifying grammatical concepts would be significantly reduced, the opportunities for oral communication would increase considerably. At the same time, rather than fighting the use of English in the Spanish classroom, its use would become a teaching aid. Thus, students would learn more about the culture of Hispanicity (The Culture of Spain in the United States) and become enthusiastic about the language itself. The globalization of foreign language foundation courses not only reflects the student's daily reality but also that of our times.

Learning grammar through singing? An intervention with EFL primary school learners,"Singing has been advocated as an efficient supplementary strategy in language teaching, but little is known about its effect on grammar learning. We conducted an intervention study (five lessons) with primary EFL learners (N = 57, mean age = 8.67, SD = 0.60) who were taught new vocabulary and grammar through either singing or speaking lyrics. The control group had new vocabulary introduced during regular lessons. Language gains were assessed through pre-, post-, and follow-up tests; affect was measured after each lesson. Students in the singing group showed similar vocabulary gains to students in the control group and larger gains than students in the speaking group. Importantly, singing students outperformed both groups on spelling and grammar learning. Positive affect was similar across intervention groups, but only the singing group showed significantly enhanced positive affect compared to the control group. Overall, results indicate a potential benefit of singing for grammar learning.y     PU  - PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD     PI  - OXFORD     PA  - THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1
Sources of individual differences in the acquisition of tense inflection by English second language learners with and without specific language impairment,"The goal of this study was to investigate whether individual difference factors influence the second language (L2) learning of children with specific language impairment (SLI) and children with typical development (TD) differently. The study focuses on tense inflection development in English L2 children. The roles of age of L2 acquisition, length of L2 exposure, and first language (L1) were examined. Twenty-four pairs of 4- and 5-year-old English L2 children with SLI and English L2 children with TD participated in the study. Children's responses on the third person singular and regular past tense probes of the Test of Early Grammatical Impairment (Rice & Wexler, 2001) were analyzed using logistic mixed regression modeling and classification procedures. For all children, those who started learning English later performed better than children who started learning English earlier, but the advantage of an older age of acquisition was particularly present in the L2 with SLI group. For children in the L2 group with TD, their accuracy with tense inflection clearly increased with longer L2 exposure, but this was not found for the L2 children with SLI. Finally, L2 children with TD were better able to transfer L1 knowledge than L2 children with SLI.

Text-setting Constraints in English Songs Sung by Native Korean Speakers,"This study explores text-setting phenomena in English and Korean children’s songs, asserting that the constraints that regulate the alignment of a specific language to music differ according to the typological and phonological difference of the language. Within the Optimality Theory framework, the two representative constraints that pertain to text-setting are tested with children’s songs in English and Korean. As a result, the metrical constraint critically operates for universal text-setting patterns in English verses, whereas the grouping constraint ranks high for Korean verses. These reversed rankings represent that English follows a stress-to-beat mapping system while Korean versification works at a syllable-to-note mapping system. Based on this difference, this study attempts to observe the text-setting patterns in English children’s songs by native Korean speakers. Through the analysis, it is observed that English versification by native Korean speakers shows different text-setting patterns from the universal patterns by native English speakers. The Korean participants prefer to fulfill the grouping constraint rather than the metrical constraint in English text-setting. In addition, the native phonological grammar also affects English syllabification since vowel epenthesis occurs after an obstruent coda in English lyrics. This nativization process of English verse causes idiosyncratic text-setting form by native Korean speakers. Through the analyses, it is suggested that the relative importance of constraints depends on a specific language, and that the native phonology can affect the versification of a foreign language.

Gaming as an English Language Learning Resource among Young Children in Denmark,"This article presents a study of Danish young English language learners' (YELLs') contact with and use of Extramural English (EE) (N = 107, aged 8 [n = 49] and 10 [n = 58]). They have received little formal English instruction: two lessons per week for one year. Data on EE-habits were collected with a one-week language diary (self-report with parental guidance). Participants reported minutes spent each day on seven EE-activities: gaming, listening to music, reading, talking, watching television, writing, and other. Vocabulary proficiency scores were obtained using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVTTM-4). The results show that most time was spent on gaming, music, and watching television. Boys gamed significantly more (p < .001) than girls (235 minutes/week vs. 47 minutes/week). Additionally, the results show that gaming with both oral and written English input and gaming with only written English input are significantly related to vocabulary scores, in particular for boys. By investigating the EE-habits of YELLs and relations with second language (L2) English vocabulary learning, this study adds valuable new insights and knowledge about a topic that is becoming increasingly important for children in a globalized world.

"[""Analysis on English vocabulary acquisition by accomplishment levels with an integrated teaching model for English and music through songs"", ""노래를 활용한 영어ㆍ음악 통합 수업에서 성취 수준별 영어 어휘 습득 분석""]","This study aims to investigate whether an integrated teaching model, English and Music Through Songs(EMTS), has the possibility to decrease the deepening disparities in students’ levels of English ability by using EMTS to help the vocabulary acquisition of elementary English learners. To evaluate how EMTS affected participants’ vocabulary acquisition, the progress of the sub-groups’ (high-level, mid-level, low-level) English acquisition was measured between the experimental group and a control group. Also, based on the results of the tests for normalized distributions, the progress of the experimental group was analyzed. Finally, a short survey with the participants in the experimental group regarding their opinions of EMTS was conducted. The analyzed data showed the following: First, the exposure to vocabulary through English songs in the CBI encouraged the participants, regardless of levels, to build their vocabulary substantially. Second, the participants’ accurate vocabulary acquisition was perceived as a salient factor influencing the use of songs, indicating the distribution of the post-test is not normally distributed. Third, most of the participants showed a positive perception and attitude toward EMTS. The findings of the study suggest that EMTS may have potential for helping to reduce the deepening disparities in students’ levels of English ability.

IMPROVING IRANIAN EFL LEARNERS' VOCABULARY RETENTION AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS ENGLISH THROUGH DIGITAL STORY TELLING: A TASK-BASED APPROACH,"According to Bull and Kajdar (2004), digital storytelling is the combination of still images with a narrated soundtrack containing voice and music at the same time, providing a semi-video clip. As the societies have grown up, and technology has penetrated into almost all families in towns and cities, traditional methods provide little impetus for children to learn and progress; thus, they need to be replaced by new ones. This study aims to illuminate the effects of digital storytelling on Iranian EFL elementary male learners' vocabulary retention. The researchers actually presented a story via video projector and power point software which contains audios, videos, and texts. This study also checks Iranian participants' attitudes towards this new educational instrument, applying a task-based approach. The researchers sought to explore whether digital storytelling has any significant effects on Iranian EFL elementary male learners' vocabulary retention. Besides, they were eager to know the learners' attitudes' toward modern method. The obtained results out of the comparison between the pre-test, posttest, and delayed posttest, revealed that digital storytelling significantly affected EFL learners' vocabulary retention. This means that the experimental group displayed a greater improvement in vocabulary retention than the control one. At the same time, learners were asked about their attitudes and ideas towards digital storytelling (experimental group) and traditional storytelling (control group). Regarding the achieved data, the results indicated that majority of students in the experimental group had positive attitudes towards applying digital storytelling for learning English.

On the other hand, learners in the control group believed that studying eight stories in the traditional manner was a little difficult.

"MUSIC, POETRY AND FUN ACTIVITIES IN ENGLISH TEACHING: AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION EXPERIENCE","This Pedagogical Project, developed within the Teachers Training framework, aims to achieve a better acquisition of meaningful knowledge of a foreign language in Early Childhood Education through practical experiences in the classroom. The use of music in teaching a second language allows students to explore their voices, improve their ear, develop their natural rhythmic sense, express themselves with their bodies through the use of games, and lose their fear of communicating in another language that is different from their mother tongue, improving their pronunciation and in general their listening and speaking skills in the form of poems, chants, rhythmic language, movements and songs in English in a creative way.This study aims to explore the possible improvements students can make in pronunciation as well as in the acquisition of oral skills through pronunciation and listening activities, facing the challenge that gradual implementation of bilingual English teaching involves.The used methodology supports English teachers in Early Childhood Education classrooms who want to incorporate music, movement, poetry and rhythm into their classes, offering a new teaching model.We will conclude by offering the results of this teaching pattern based on the integration of those musical and rhythmic elements.

THE EFFECT OF USING SHORT STORIES AND SONGS ON THE SECOND LANGUAGE ACHIEVEMENT OF IRANIAN YOUNG LEARNERS,"THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AN ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF USING SHORT STORIES AND SONGS ON THE SECOND LANGUAGE ACHIEVEMENT OF IRANIAN YOUNG LEARNERS. TO DO SO, SIXTY IRANIAN YOUNG LEARNERS WHO WERE STUDYING IN THE KINDERGARTENS AND PRESCHOOL CENTERS WITH THE AGE RANGE OF 5 TO 7 WERE SELECTED AS THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE STUDY AND WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS EXPOSED TO A LOT OF ACTIVITIES ENRICHED WITH SHORT STORIES AND SONGS, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ENGAGED IN THE ORDINARY PROGRAM OF THE CLASSROOM. AFTER 24 SESSIONS OF TREATMENT, THE POSTTEST OF YLE WAS ADMINISTERED. THE OUTCOME OF THE POSTTEST DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING THE TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED THE CONTROL GROUP ON THE TOTAL ACHIEVEMENT TEST. SECONDLY THE DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS' MEANS ON THE COMPONENTS OF SPEAKING TEST IN THE TWO GROUPS. THEREFORE, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT IN ALL FOUR SUB-SKILLS OF SPEAKING TEST, NAMELY, PRONUNCIATION, FLUENCY, GRAMMAR, AND VOCABULARY, AND THE TOTAL TEST OF SPEAKING, THE LEARNERS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OUTPERFORMED THE ONES IN THE CONTROL GROUP. ALTHOUGH THE BENEFITS OF EMPLOYING SONGS, MUSIC, AND STORIES HAVE VASTLY BEEN CONFIRMED IN THE ELT RESEARCH, THE PRESENT STUDY EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPOSING EFL YOUNG LEARNERS TO SUCH ACTIVITIES AND SHOWS THAT THE COMPONENTS OF SPEAKING ALSO WILL BE AFFECTED IN THE PROCESS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY THE PRESENTATION OF SONGS AND STORIES TO THE LEARNERS.

"Effects of Input Properties, Vocabulary Size, and L1 on the Development of Third Person Singular -s in Child L2 English","This study was designed to investigate the development of third-person singular (3SG) s in children who learn English as a second language (L2). Adopting the usage-based perspective on the learning of inflection, we analyzed spontaneous speech samples collected from 15 English L2 children who were followed over a 2-year period. Assessing the contribution of a wide range of predictors, we show that word frequency, allomorph, lexicon size, inflectional properties of the first language (L1), and months of exposure to English all have impact on English L2 children's use of 3SG s in obligatory contexts. This study enhances both our understanding of the development of 3SG s and of child L2 acquisition. The outcomes support a usage-based approach to learning inflection and emphasize the importance of a multifactorial analysis of language development.

The potential of music in promoting oracy in students with English as an additional language,"The ways in which we are able to communicate are, most of the time, dominated through speaking and listening. The ability to speak, listen and understand speech is the basis of oracy; a necessity within society today. The purpose of this study was to examine the interconnectedness of music and language to identify if music can assist in the promotion of oracy in everyday communicative contexts in students who have English as an additional language (EAL). Through the creation of a purpose specific music program, five primary school participants were taught six Western songs, paired with appropriate questions, over a six-week period to determine their oral capacity. Methods within this action research study included observations, informal interviews and graphic melodic contouring. The results indicate that all participants demonstrated an increase in oracy, but to varying degrees, as well as the improvement of pronunciation and vocabulary acquisition. Recommendations for future studies within this area are discussed.     PU  - SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD     PI  - LONDON     PA  - 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1
Creative Approach to Teaching English as a Foreign Language,"The article highlights possibility of using popular and traditional American songs in the language classroom. Using songs does not mean only their singing. This method proves to be successful in teaching English as a foreign language for students of any level: from secondary school to universities. For English learners who have chosen language to be their profession it can be used in teaching practical disciplines, like grammar and phonetics, but also in teaching theoretical subjects, like lexicology, stylistics, etc. Any activity connected with songs use in educational process contributes to students' creative development and thus has educative value.

The development of English tense and agreement morphology in Welsh-English bilingual children with and without specific language impairment,"This study investigated whether third person singular -s and past tense accuracy and error types can reveal distinct developmental patterns of agreement and tense acquisition in younger and older Welsh (L1) sequential bilingual (L2) English children with typical development (L2-TLD) and in younger children with language impairment (L2-SLI_Y). A group of older (L2-TLD_O; mean age = 93.72 months) and younger (L2-TLD_Y; mean age = 67 months) Welsh-English (TLD) bilingual children and a group of young (mean age = 63 months) children with SLI (L2-SLI_Y) age matched to the L2-TLD_Y group were administered the screening component of the Test of Early Grammatical Impairment. Results indicated that the three groups differed in their production of third person singular -s and regular past tense but not in accuracy on irregular past tense verbs, when vocabulary skills were considered. The L2-SLI_Y children produced similar error types to the L2-TLD_Y children, who differed from their L2-TLD_O peers in this respect. L2 children's vocabulary size, nonverbal intelligence, and item-level factors, such as frequency and morphophonology, differentially contributed to their performance across the various morphemes. We discuss these results within current accounts of language development and impairment.

"[""The effects of teaching English song through Korean song in vocabulary acquisition and affective attitude"", ""우리 동요를 활용한 영어 노래 지도가 어휘력과 정의적 태도에 미치는 영향""]","The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of teaching English song through Korean song in vocabulary acquisition and affective attitude in the elementary school environment. For this purpose, the experimental group and the controlled group were divided with second graders in an elementary school. The experimental group were taught vocabulary with English song through korean song. On the other hand, The controlled group were taught the same vocabulary with flash cards during the same period. The findings of this study were as follows: Firstly, as a result of teaching English song through Korean song, There were significant differences between two t-scores. Teaching vocabulary with English song through korean song proved to have a better effect on vocabulary listening, comprehension of vocabulary meaning, and  speaking skills.  Secondly, as a result of surveying the questionnaire, between the controlled group and the experimental group, there was not a significant difference in affective attitude. The study indicated that teaching English song by using Korean song could increase not only vocabulary listening and comprehension of vocabulary meaning but also speaking skills. This was due to the fact that they already had an understanding of the meaning of the words in Korean.     PU  - The Korea English Education Society",1
"[""A Study of English-Teaching Model through Stories and Songs"", ""영어동화와 노래를 결합한 정의적 영어수업모형의 적용 효과""]","This study aims to develop and apply an English-teaching model through stories and songs for English-learners in elementary school.  The study of English teaching model focuses on not only how learners increase their listening and vocabulary skills, but also how they improve their affective learning attitudes toward English. This study was conducted in an after-school English class in an elementary school for two months. The participants were 20 subjects in a control group and 20 in an experimental group. The control group learned English using an English textbook, while the experimental group learned English using stories and songs.The study tested two hypotheses. First, affective learning attitudes such as interest, motivation, confidence, and learning demeanor of the students in the experimental group would be more positive after the learning period than those of the students in the control group. Both language abilities and affective factors would be shown with tests and surveys administered before and after the two-month learning period. Second, the subjects in the experimental group, learning with English stories and songs, would make greater progress in listening and vocabulary ability than those in the control group, using the English textbook and the grammar translation method.The results of this study are summarized as follows. First, the model using English stories and songs made a meaningful difference on learner attitudes compared with the controled group. Affective survey results showed that the experimental group subjects had a significant advantage in interest, motivation, confidence, and attitude beyond the control group subjects at the end of the study period. Second, the English-teaching model using stories and songs increased listening and vocabulary abilities when compared to the teaching model using an English textbook. While both groups improved their listening and vocabulary scores, pre-tests and post-tests showed that the experimental group received significantly more enhanced scores than did the control group.According to an analysis of these results, this study advises that the English-teaching model be adopted for learners in after-school English classes in elementary schools. In particular, the teaching model through English stories and songs may improve learners’ affective learning attitudes as well as their listening and vocabulary abilities. This model seems to be effective for learners in elementary school.     PU  - Institute of Research in Humanities",1
"[""Sheng, Language of Protest, Culture of resistance"", ""‘쉥’(Sheng), 저항의 언어, 저항의 문화""]","Sheng is a Swahili-based patois or slang-based sociolect, originating in Nairobi, Kenya, and influenced by the many languages spoken there. The word is coined from the two words - (S)wahili and (Eng)lish.While primarily a language of urban youth, it has spread across social classes to the halls of the Kenyan parliament and geographically to neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda.Originating in the early 1970s in the Eastlands area of Nairobi (variously described as a 'slum', 'ghetto' or 'suburb'), Sheng is now heard among matatu drivers across the region, and in the popular media. Most of the Sheng words are introduced in various communities and schools and given wide exposure by music artists who include them in their lyrics, hence the rapid growth. It can be assumed to be the first language of many Kenyans in urban areas. Like all types of slang, it is used mainly by the urban youth and is part of popular culture in this country. It also evolves rapidly, as words are incorporated into or derived from slang use. It is gaining wide currency among East African hip hop artists -both mainstream and ""underground"", whose music facilitates its spread and contribute to rapid changes or shifts in its lexicon, but also among university and secondary-school students. Although the grammar, syntax, and much of the vocabulary are drawn from Swahili, Sheng borrows from English and from the languages of various ethnic groups in Kenya, such as, the Gikuyu, the Luo and the Kamba. Notable however, is the borrowing of words that are not from any local language or English -- such as the Sheng word dame ""lady"" -- which has a similar meaning in French, or morgen ""morning"" - a Sheng word used in some areas with a similar meaning in German.Sheng vocabulary can vary significantly among regions of Kenya and East Africa, and even neighbourhoods of Nairobi. Most of the youth living in Nairobi often use Sheng as their everyday language rather than speak fluent Swahili or English.     PU  - Institute of African Studies",0
Acquisition of the Third Person Singular -s by L1- Korean Adult/Child Learners of English,"This study explores whether children have an advantage over adults in learning second language (L2) inflectional morphology. L2 theories such as the Fundamental Difference Hypothesis and the Less Is More Hypothesis would predict that children have an advantage over adults in the acquisition of L2 inflectional morphology. The study focuses on the English third person singular -s, which is notoriously difficult for L2 speakers to acquire. Korean adult (n = 51) and child (n = 40) L2 learners completed a picturenarration task designed to assess their implicit knowledge of the target morpheme. The analysis found no difference in the performances of proficiency-matching children and adults, contra the Fundamental Difference Hypothesis and the Less Is More Hypothesis.

HOW NORWEGIAN UPPER SECONDARY STUDENTS LEARN SPANISH OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM AND THROUGH COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,"In this presentation, we look at different artefacts that mediate the learning of Spanish. We focus on students at the age of 17 and 18 in upper secondary education in Norway and how they use material and symbolic tools in order to improve their communicative skills. We ask how the students take advantage of learning opportunities outside the classroom.In Norway, English as a foreign language is a compulsory subject. Usually, the students choose a third language in year 8 (age 13), and Spanish is the most popular language. Globalization and rapid developments in digital media technology have transformed Norwegian society by making it more diverse and Spanish forms part of this diversity.In 2015, we conducted a survey comprising 181 students of Spanish in year 13 (age 18). The topic was their opportunities for practicing Spanish outside the classroom in everyday life and when traveling. Further steps involved qualitative in-depth interviews informed by the analysis of the questionnaire. In 2016, we carried out the interviews, where 24 subjects were asked to describe in what situations they communicate in Spanish and their future plans and goals. Our purpose was to identify the meditational means that they use as they pursue their Spanish learning goals and to examine the role Spanish plays in their lives.In the analysis and discussion, we draw on Vygotsky's educational theory in cultural context [3] [4] and theory in second language acquisition [1] [2]. The subjects report that the digital tools allow them to practice Spanish in their spare time and that they practice Spanish online for amusement (music, tv series, movies, football news, fashion blogs, etc.). To a great extent they give attention to comments in Spanish on the chat in social media, but they seldom contribute with comments themselves. The subjects show willingness to communicate in Spanish in real life situations, in Norway and abroad. They report that practicing Spanish outside the classroom helps them to improve their communicative skills. Almost everyone is convinced that knowing Spanish gives them an advantage when it comes to getting acquainted with new people and when networking.Our research project can give new insights into how learning of Spanish takes place outside the classroom. We intend to further increase our knowledge about how and to what extent students use the target language, and we are now in the process of designing an additional survey, which we will carry out during the school year 2017/18. By November 2017, we will be able to show some preliminary results of this new project.

First, what effects does learning English through singing children’s literature have on primary school students’long term memory? Second, what effects can the use of the songs have on the student’s grammar learning? Lastly, what affective responses and evaluations do the students make for learning English through singing children’s literature? The participants of the study are 60 primary school students in the fifth grade.Whereas the experimental group is exposed to 12 week English instruction through songs of children’s literature, the control group simply reads aloud the same children’s books for the same period. The findings indicate that there is significant difference between the two groups in terms of long-term memory. The experimental group had better long-term memory than the class of read-aloud. In grammar learning, there was no significant difference between two groups but both groups showed that their grammar learning was enhanced. Lastly, in the affective domains, many students in the class of songs showed increased interests and motivation in learning English.

For this study, the participants are 11 fifth-graders in a normal class and 18 fourth-graders in a CLIL class in a countryside elementary school near a metropolitan city in Korea. During the first semester of 2019, an experimental group was instructed in a CLIL course focused on English integrated with six subjects; science, social studies, art, music, P.E., and home economics. The study employed a pre-test and a post-test to investigate students’ vocabulary improvement. The participants were assigned to write their reflective notes and fill out the survey with open-ended questions. The results revealed that both groups improved their vocabulary scores, but the CLIL group had a more significant difference statistically on the t-test result. In addition, the CLIL curriculum, based on three competences (3Cs): communication competence, community competence, and knowledge information process competence, enhanced not only students’ English abilities and other subject comprehension abilities simultaneously but also their positive perceptions toward the CLIL class.

"Cue reliability, salience and early comprehension of agreement: Evidence from Greek","Previous studies across languages (English, Spanish, French) have argued that perceptual salience and cue reliability can explain cross-linguistic differences in early comprehension of verbal agreement. Here we tested this hypothesis further by investigating early comprehension in Greek, where markers have high salience and reliability (compared to Spanish and English) predicting early comprehension, as in French. We investigated two and three-year-old Greek-speaking children's ability to distinguish third person singular and plural agreement in a picture-selection task. We also examined the frequency of these morphemes in child-directed speech to address input effects. Results showed that three-year-olds are sensitive to both singular and plural agreement, earlier than children acquiring English and Spanish, but later than French, and despite singular agreement being more frequent than plural agreement in the child corpus. These findings provide further support for the role of salience and reliability during early acquisition, while highlighting a potential effect of morpheme position.

Language activation in dual language schools: the development of subject-verb agreement in the English and Spanish of heritage speaker children,"Cross-linguistically, monolingual children produce target-like inflected verbs much earlier than they can reliably distinguish between singular and plural subject-verb agreement morphology in comprehension (i.e. Johnson, V., J. de Villiers, and H.

In heritage speakers, Spanish agreement morphology shows optionality due to reduced input, especially when children transition to English schooling (i.e. Montrul, S. 2004.

Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 15 (1): 22-38). We investigate how simultaneous heritage bilingual children's interpretation and use of subject-verb agreement in English and Spanish may be modulated by increased input and activation of Spanish in dual language education (DLE). 125 participants aged 3-7 (42 heritage children, 40 English monolinguals, 39 Spanish-dominant children) took part in a fill-in-the-blanks task and a picturematching task. In English, bilingual comprehension accuracy surpassed that of the monolinguals. In Spanish, bilingual production lagged behind that of the Spanish-dominant children and language output was found to be a greater predictor of productive accuracy than increased activation of Spanish in DLE. The implications of these results for theories of bilingualism and DLE are discussed.

Noun plural production in preschoolers with early cochlear implantation: An experimental study of Dutch and German,"Objectives: Studies investigating language skills of children after cochlear implantation usually present general measures of expressive/receptive vocabulary and grammar and rarely tackle the acquisition of specific language phenomena (word classes, grammatical constructions, word forms, etc.). Furthermore, research is largely restricted to children acquiring English. Cross-linguistic comparisons among children acquiring different languages are almost inexistent. The present study targets the acquisition of noun plurals (e.g., dogs, balls) by Dutch- and German-speaking children implanted before their second birthday. Given its structural complexity and irregularity, noun plural formation is a good indicator of grammatical proficiency in children at risk for a developmental delay.Methods: The study sample consisted of 14 cochlear-implanted (Cl) children (M = 55 months of age), 80 age-matched normally hearing (NH) controls, and 40 normally hearing controls matched by Hearing Age (HA). The children were administered an elicitation task in which they had to provide plural forms to a set of singular nouns. The analysis focussed on the following variables: Hearing status (CI, NH), Language (Dutch, German), and Suffix Predictability/Stem Transparency of the plural words.Results: There was no significant difference between children with CI and their NH peers in correct plural production. In both child groups, plural responses followed the predicted pattern of Suffix Predictability/ Stem Transparency. However, children with CI significantly more frequently replied to the test item with a recast of the singular noun instead of the plural, and the probability of these responses increased with later age of CI implantation. Furthermore, Dutch-speaking children showed an overall better performance than German-speaking children.Conclusions: The findings suggest that after 3 years of implant use, preschoolers with early cochlear implantation show age-appropriate patterns of noun plural formation, but still have to catch up with respect to associating a particular singular with its plural form.

We analyze 500 pop songs from annual hit lists in English-dominant media in the last ten years (2011–2020). We first exclude 134 songs with explicit or non-English lyrics. We then assess each of the remaining 366 songs in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and tempo, using three criteria: (a) whether over 90% of vocabulary tokens in it would be known to primary English learners; (b) whether it has three or fewer tokens of past participles, a grammatical structure not yet studied by primary English learners; and (c) whether its tempo is slow enough to facilitate the lyrics’ comprehension by primary English learners. We find 43 songs that meet these criteria. We then qualitatively examine these songs’ videos, using eight criteria to exclude any with content potentially inappropriate for primary learners (e.g., sexual or violent material), removing 37 more songs. Thus, we find six songs appropriate for use in primary English education. Pedagogical implications are discussed based on the results.

The Effects of Co-Presenting English Articles and Nouns on EFL Learners’ Vocabulary Learning,"Although article errors from Korean learners are abundant, few studies have investigated how to teach articles to overcome the specific difficulties faced by Koreans. This study aims to examine the effects of co-presenting English indefinite articles with count nouns on Korean young learners’ vocabulary learning. An experiment was conducted with 174 elementary school students divided into two groups: a present-article group and a non-present-article group. The groups were taught the same vocabulary items but with different materials; one received articles-nounscombined materials and the other received nouns-only materials. The results showed that the co-presentation of indefinite articles with singular nouns during vocabulary teaching was more effective than the presentation of nouns without articles in terms of developing L2 sentence-completion ability in students. In addition, the co-presentation group was more successful in including indefinite articles when converting plural nouns to singular nouns. The study suggests that the co-presentation of indefinite articles with count nouns during vocabulary instruction can significantly improve elementary school students’ ability to use indefinite articles.

Present tense verb morphology of Spanish HL and L2 children in dual immersion Feature Reassembly revisited,"We provide a snapshot of childhood morphology development in our investigation of two profiles of bilinguals (age 9-10) in an English-Spanish dual immersion academic setting: Spanish heritage language (SHL, n = 21) and second language (SL2, n = 41) children. Three tasks were given to the 62 bilinguals and 15 age-matched controls (Spanish first language, SL1): oral comprehension of 20 singular-plural present verbs, written sentence production of 10 similar verbs, and a meaning-focused writing task. SHL children were comparable to controls in production of number agreement, and showed no asymmetry between comprehension and production. SL2 learners showed lower accuracy than both SHL and SL1 children. A similar pattern was observed when person agreement and tense, aspect, mood and vowel errors were considered. The most common error among SHL and SL2 children was overregularization of stem vowels, a typical developmental error. The Feature Reassembly model of grammar can accommodate the range of possibilities represented by the data we present.

Korean EFL Learners’ Development of Inflectional Morphemes,"This paper examines English inflectional morpheme development among Korean EFL learners. Two groups of children, fourth graders (N=20) and sixth graders (N=19) were given both real-word sentence completion tasks and pseudoword sentence completion tasks. The task materials measuring the students’ knowledge of inflectional morpheme include six types of morphemes (plural -s, regular past -ed, 3rd person singular -s, progressive -ing, comparative -er, and superlative -est). Twenty four sentences (four sentences for each morphology) were created and children were asked to complete the sentences using a given base form of a word. The results indicated that, in learning of the regular past tense -ed, learners using L2 for communication do not seem to override EFL learners accustomed to the function of a written task, and that the grammatical morpheme, which does not exist in Korean L1, has a strong effect on the acquisition. This study concluded that Korean L1 absent morphemes seem to be difficult for Korean English learners to acquire regardless of language learning environments: namely natural language learning and classroom language learning.

Five Factors Influencing the Speaking Ability of University Freshmen:What's Their Secret?,"In Korea, the pressure for students to learn English is ongoing and often this pressure begins before elementary school, but does it actually help with the acquisition of spoken English? This study investigates which of numerous factors most influenced the speaking ability of university freshmen. Using questionnaires and oral testing with 203 female participants, it was determined that five factors had a significant influence on speaking ability. From most to least important they were: 1) concepts of themselves as learners and their feelings about English; 2) age; 3) the total amount of time spent with visual media, songs, and tutors before elementary school; 4) how often they read or surfed the internet in English; and 5) the total amount of time spent at language institutes or academies studying English. Self-esteem and age being important factors in second language learning are not new concepts. However, the results of this study also imply that children should be exposed to enjoyable English early and, later, to English in more authentic contexts, whether it be reading for pleasure or attending a language institute.

The objective of the study that is presented is to apply the children's songs in the learning of the vocabulary of the French language in the children of the initial level of the Educational Institution San Antonio de Padua Chosica-Lima 2016. A quasi-experimental study was carried out in which two groups, one of 24 5-year-old children from the ""A"" classroom, who constituted the control group, and the other 24 children from 5 years of the ""B"" classroom The experimental quasi; We used strategies for the practical learning assisted by the teacher, Autonomous and Collaborative. A knowledge test was applied to a learning session observation card and a survey applied to the parent to learn the language learning of their children.We established a general hypothesis and two specific hypotheses we used Mann Whitney's U test, proving that the children's songs used improved the learning level of the French language vocabulary in acquiring knowledge of a foreign language, to improve the process of Teaching and learning of the language in children of the initial level of 5 years.

Macapat as a Model and Method of Learning English-Javanese Vocabulary,"The purpose of this article is to offer Macapat as a model of learning English-Javanese vocabulary. Macapat is a kind of poetic meter in traditional Javanese poetry and is also known as a popular culture in Javanese society. In the formal education, from elementary until high degree, macapat is used as a lesson material in the college. Related with cross-cultural studies, the use of attractive model can give more experience for language learners and language teachers. For the learner, they can get more knowledge about macapat song and vocabulary. According to Javanese teacher competence, they must have mardawa basa, mardawa sastra and mardawa lagu, as a primary knowledge to compose language using poetic meter and also sing macapat. The teacher can improve their language competence to create a macapat song which is composed of two different vocabulary languages. It can be concluded that macapat can be used as a model of learning English-Javanese vocabulary.

Source- and product-oriented strategies in L2 acquisition of plural marking in German,"This article deals with the acquisition of the German plural system. It raises the question how morphologically complex words are represented in the mental grammar and in the lexicon of children and how this representation emerges.There are several theoretical accounts dealing with this question. These accounts are basically of two kinds. One approach models the German number system as rulebased; i.e. source-oriented rules are postulated that operate on the singular form of the noun. The second approach is schema-based. Essential to this approach is the idea that speakers form the plural of a given noun according to prototypical plural shapes. Empirical evidence can be found for both approaches, but neither of them seems to be able to fully explain acquisitional paths on its own.On the basis of the analysis of acquisitional data, this article argues for an expanded schema account that embraces both source- and product-oriented mechanisms. We propose an acquisition model according to which learners start out with storing plural forms holistically in an associative network; then they abstract productoriented schemas from these stored forms that focus on the typical gestalts of German plural forms. In a last step, they establish source-oriented schemas that relate singular schemas with plural schemas.The data for this study were gathered in a nonce word elicitation experiment from children aged 6 to 10 learning German either as their native or second language. In the latter case, the children's L1 was either Russian or Turkish.     PU  - SPRINGER     PI  - DORDRECHT     PA  - VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0
THE ROLE OF FINGERPLAYS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE SKILLS WHEN TEACHING ENGLISH IN THE KINDERGARTEN,"Fingerplays, most commonly used at pm-school age, am hand actions or movements with fingers in combination with singing or spoken-words aimed at engaging the attention and interest of the child. They have many educational benefits at pre-schools age. The article describes the neum-physiological mechanisms by which finger plays prove to be resourceful means for developing young children's fine motor skills, and how it helps them to explore the world and develop their intellectual potential.In addition to the neuro-physiological aspect, finger plays are also considered from the point of view of the psycho-pedagogical and speech development in TEFL at the pm-school period. Attention is paid to finger and hand actions as integral part of Jolly Phonics Programme. It is a fun and child centered approach to teaching literacy through synthetic phonics. With actions for each of the 42 letter sounds, the multi-sensory method is very motivating for children and teachers, who can see their students achieve. As a soruce of positive emotions, they smoothly and subconsciously introduce the child to the world of foreign language. They activate the creative imagination. develop the intellect, enrich it with skills that children can use at later stages of language acquisition - reading and writing. Finger plays stimulate listening skills and attention, oral language, pre-reading and pre-writing skills. learning vocabulary and grammar.

"[""A Case of Theme-based and Content-based Integrated English Class for Elementary School Students"", ""초등영어 주제중심 교과 융합수업 사례연구""]","The purpose of the study is to explore the effects of Theme-based integrated English class for elementary school students in terms of students’ vocabulary achievement and the perceptions of their learning experience. For data collection, 11 participants of 4th grade in countryside elementary school from April to October in 2018 participated in theme-based English class integrated with subjects; math, music, social studies, science, Korean, and art, and then took both pre- and post-vocabulary tests and were given post-survey questionnaires with open-ended questions. In addition, the participants were asked to write their perceptions of each theme-based integrated English class. The findings show that there was no significant difference between the pre- and post-vocabulary tests. However, the theme-based integrated English classes were appeared to have positive influence on the students’ motivation in English. The participants’ learning diaries were reported to be satisfactory despite the learners’ burden for acquiring diverse vocabulary of each theme and subject. Problems and concerns were mentioned for more effective future integrated English education.     PU  - Korean Association For Learner-Centered Curriculum And Instruction",0
"[""An analysis of the textbooks of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) published in China (PRC)"", ""중국의 중국어 교재 분포와 개발 현황 분석""]","This study aims to report and examine the current status of instructional materials of Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) that have been published in China (PRC). The authors analyzed 4126 CFL textbooks searched on the website of the National Library of China.As for the purposes of the materials, a lack of development is observed in the textbooks for interpretation/translation, news-based materials, materials based on songs/games and the test preparation materials for non-HSK exams. The entire proportion of Chinese for Specific Purposes (CSP) materials, of which Chinese for Business Purposes (CBP) is the majority, is also only 9.02%, which means that the development of materials for CSP or Chinese for Academic Purpose (CAP) has not been active during the 30-year history of CFL education since the ‘Reforms and Opening up’.Regarding the skills covered, the proportion of writing materials was particularly low and no writing textbook was ever identified for CSP or CAP, which indicates that the CFL education in China has centered on the teaching of Chinese for General Purposes (CGP).In terms of the levels, more than half of the overall materials were intended for beginners. Specifically, materials for speaking, Chinese characters and pronunciation follow this right-skewed distribution but those for reading, vocabulary/grammar and cultural topics show the opposite, i.e., left-skewed distribution. This means that the focus of CFL instruction shifts from speaking, characters and pronunciation to reading, vocabulary/grammar and culture in the more advanced levels. Another notable point is that the materials aimed at elementary to middle school students only account for 7.73%, which implies the lack of activity to develop educational materials or instructional models for Chinese for Young Learners (CYL). However, future trend is worth noting because a slight but steady increase in CYL materials is detected since the 2000's.To sum up, among the CFL instructional materials released in China to date, CSP, CAP or CYL materials have been underdeveloped. As the publication of these materials, however, has been on a small but continuous increase since the 2000's, it seems to deserve more attention in the future research on CFL textbooks.

"[""An analysis of errors in classroom English of pre-service teachers"", ""초등 예비교사의 교실영어 오류분석""]","The purpose of this study is to investigate the English errors of 24 university students who participated in a preparation course for the state-run teacher employment test. The data were collected from the participants' classroom English, which was produced in their 6-minute long, mock microteaching sessions. The errors they made were analyzed and categorized in terms of three aspects: grammar, lexicon and pronunciation. Their errors were more closely analyzed in four types: ommission, selection, addition and ordering. Further investigation was made in the level of English proficiency and their beliefs and expectations on the use of classroom English. The results showed that frequent errors were found in the order of grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. Also, the most common grammatical errors were found in omission of articles, third person singular s, and objects. In lexical errors, the selection or addition of words was frequently found. With regard to pronunciation, the participants made a great portion of errors in the selection of appropriate consonants or vowels. In addition, the participants of lower proficiency made errors almost twice as often as the ones of higher proficiency. On the basis of these results, some pedagogical implications were drawn for the pre-service primary teacher education.     PU  - The Korea Association of Primary English Education",0
The acquisition of the English plural morpheme by native mandarin Chinese-speaking children,"Although the acquisition of the English plural morpheme by monolingual English-speaking children (L1 learners) has been studied extensively, little is known about the processes through which native speakers of other languages (L2 speakers) acquire the English plural morpheme. To understand the similarities and differences between L1 and L2 English plural morpheme acquisition, 10 native Mandarin-speaking children who immigrated to the United States between ages 5 and 16 years were followed for 5 years. Their proficiency in English plural morpheme production was measured by a picture description task and by their spontaneous speech. In contrast to L1 learners who master the plural morpheme within 3 years of age, only 7 of these 10 L2 learners did so after 5 years of English exposure. Age of initial exposure to English and language environment explained individual differences to some extent. Participants' speech illustrated all error types made by L1 learners; however, L2 learners more frequently marked the same noun inconsistently in the same testing session, and more often overgeneralized the plural morpheme in singular or mass noun contexts. Differences between L2 learners and L1 learners with specific language impairment are also discussed.

"[""The impact of integrating music into primary English instruction using informational texts"", ""정보텍스트를 활용한 초등 영어-음악 통합 수업의 효과에 대한 연구""]","This study aims to investigate the impact of integrating music into English instruction using informational texts in a Korean primary EFL setting. Two research questions were proposed: 1) What are some of the effects derived from the change of the participants’ English learning when using informational texts about music? 2) What are some impacts observed in English-music integrated lessons from the perspective of participants’ recognition of integrated learning and extending music knowledge? To find the answers to the research questions, the data were collected from twenty 6th grade students in a primary school through a variety of methods and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The study yielded two major results. First, the students experienced different ways of learning English. For example, they started to learn new words using techniques such as inferencing and categorizing through the contexts of informational texts and improved vocabulary abilities. They also learned how to integrate other language skills such as speaking and writing based on reading informational texts. Second, the learners recognized the effects of integrating music as well as other subjects into English classes. Additionally, they expanded their musical knowledge by learning musical instruments, genres, and types of performance by linking the musical informational texts with their prior knowledge.

"[""The differences in Korean vocabulary and word fluency between young children with full-time and part-time English education experience"", ""전일제와 시간제 영어교육경험 유아간의 한국어 어휘력 및 단어 유창성의 차이""]","The purpose of this study is to compare the development of Korean vocabulary and word fluency between 5-year-old young children with full-time and part-time English education experience. In order to examine whether the experience of English education after the elementary school education will be effective, we conducted a survey on the comparison the development of Korean vocabulary and word fluency between 7-year-old young children with full-time and part-time English education experience. The subjects of the study are 23 children of 5-years-old who are receiving immersion type English education funded to 3 classes of English education institution 3 located in Busan Gyeongsangnam-do, and 3 classes of 3 kindergartens. Of the 7-year-old children who listened to the English classes after the release of English at 3 places of English education institutions, 20 children received immersion- type English education in early childhood, and part-time English education. A total of 115 subjects were included. In order to compare the vocabulary of Korean children as a research tool, we conducted a PPVT-R, which was produced and standardized according to the reality of Korea, and used a word fluency test by Song(2008). As a result of the research, first, the Korean vocabulary was lower significantly children of part-time English education experience than full-time English education experience in the case of 5-year-old. There was no difference between children of part-time English education experience than full-time English education experience in the case of 5-year-old. Second, the word fluency was no significant difference between children of part-time English education experience than full-time English education experience in the case of 5 and 7-year-old.

POETRY RECITATION CONTEST: A POWERFUL MEDIUM FOR DEVELOPING LINGUISTIC AND COGNITIVE SKILLS,"The study concerns using poetry recitation as an interrogative and creative means for developing linguistic and cognitive skills in second language learners.Every year foreign language learners (FLL) at South Urals State University (SUSU) have a chance to participate in Poetry Recitation Contest organized by the Department of Foreign languages. The aim of this competition is to encourage FLL to use foreign languages through meaning, music and the linguistic styles of poetry.The educational value of the poetry recitation contest for FLL falls within the scope of cognitive, linguistic, cross-cultural and social aspects of foreign language teaching (FLT). Firstly, poetry recitation greatly influences the way of learners' thinking and their cognitive skills, in general. Cognitive skills affected by the creative attitude to learning process stimulate mental processing in a new way. To be more exact, creative thinking is characterized by flexibility, inventiveness, ingenuity, logic, and independence which result in suggesting new decision-making approaches.Poetry also offers wonderful opportunities for developing productive and receptive language skills through reading, writing, speaking, and listening practice for FLL. Then it gives the chance to expand vocabulary knowledge, to practice pronunciation and fluency. Playing with the different rhythm and rhyme patterns, getting familiar with expressive means of the language such as tropes and figures of speech makes learners feel more confident and competent. All this stirs student's internal motivation to foreign languages learning.Moreover, working with poetry from different countries and languages is an excellent opportunity to encourage students to share cultural heritage, therefore may be useful in developing learners' cultural competency.Poetry recitation is helpful for students to practice natural language and raise their social ability. As any other public speaking activity, it demands nurturing plenty of personal qualities such as self-control, concentration, mental alertness, self-confidence, imagination, good memory, deliberateness and many others.The article discusses poetry recitation role in developing FLL skills, describes the procedure of contest organization at SUSU and the primary results achieved.

A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ALGORITHM FOR ALTERNATIVE/AUGMENTATIVE COMMUNICATION IN EDUCATION OF CHILDREN WITH SPEECH DISORDERS,"Nowadays, the number of children suffering from speech disorders and impediments is steadily growing. Difficulties in speech are especially prevalent with children with special educational needs, who might also have limited language skills and may struggle with certain words, formation of phrases and construction of sentences. Traditional speech therapy has seen a lot of innovation, has come a long way in history and is helping people with varying degrees of speech impairments. Technology, however, especially alternative and aided augmentative communication solutions, has succeeded in augmenting therapy and speeding up the improvement of language skills. Many solutions are available in widely spoken languages, such as English, French and Spanish, but for some less common languages, such as Bulgarian, such communication and speech tools are still in a state of development. These languages often exhibit a unique and complex grammar, which, in the instance of Bulgarian, can morph nouns, pronouns and adverbs depending on gender, adjacent singular/plural nouns and membership. This poses unique challenges to the development of grammar-aware software and requires new approaches to the problem. This paper aims to present a knowledge-based algorithm describing the steps required to dynamically form grammatically correct sentences in Bulgarian. This algorithm will be used in a mobile application, which will also provide auditory and graphical cues, making it an especially useful educational tool for children with speech disorders. The main aim of this development is to provide an effective tool for building language skills, especially in young children.

"[""A study on the effects of teaching web-based English songs with Korean subtitles: For 3rd grade elementary school learners"", ""한국어 자막을 제시한 웹 기반 동영상 영어 노래 지도의 효과 연구: 초등학교 3학년 대상으로""]","An English song has emerged as an effective tool for teaching English to elementary school students. While the effectiveness of text-based teaching of English songs has its limitations, the Internet with its audio and visual capabilities is a perfect tool for teaching rhymes and songs. As an experimental study, this study examines the effects of two different ways to teach Internet-based English songs on students' memorizing ability of vocabulary and the words of songs, and their interest in learning English songs. For this study, two classes were randomly selected from 3rd year classes in one elementary school. The experimental group was taught with songs with Korean subtitles on the screen and the control group was taught songs with English subtitles, but without Korean subtitles. The results of the study are as follows: The experimental group and control group initially showed little difference but as the weeks passed and as more difficult songs were taught, the experimental group showed higher interest in learning songs than the control group. Also, in later experimental period when more difficult songs were taught, the experimental group performed better than the control group in English vocabulary tests and showed better ability of memorizing the words of songs. It is believed that this study shows one practical way of teaching English songs with web-based materials and Korean subtitles.     PU  - Korea Association of Multimedia-Assisted Language Learning",1
"[""A Critical Review on English Worship for Children in Korea through an English Educator’s Lens"", ""영어 교육자의 시선으로 바라본 한국 교회 어린이 영어예배에 관한 고찰""]","This paper aims to investigate English worship for children in Korea through an English professor lens. English worship for children exists as christian liturgy and at the same time it works as a field of English teaching and learning. Therefore, as a researcher, I take a look at English worship for children with literature reviews and suggest the role of Korean churches providing English worship to children with English learning needs based on the problems of teaching English in a Korean public elementary school. The main results are summarized as follows. Firstly, a sermon is similar to storytelling, which helps English learners acquire abundant vocabulary, culture, and authentic language materials, and it is effective to improve high quality listening skills with various listening contents and by activating schema. In addition, scripture reading has an effect on reading aloud on the language comprehension, that is, listening with elementary school students. Secondly, Worship songs encourage English learnes to improve their pronunciation and the Lord’s prayer recited as lexical chunks, which have the potential to affect and improve speed of language production and accuracy of pronunciation, is an effective way to improve their language communication. Thirdly, this study suggests that English worship for children supports to normalize English education of Korean public elementary school through a sharing of the problems such as English division, poor English speakers, and traditional English teaching and learning focused on tests.

Production of Spanish Grammatical Forms in US Bilingual Children,"Purpose: The purpose of this analysis was to understand how grammatical morpheme production in Spanish for typically developing Spanish-English bilingual children relates to mean length of utterance in words (MLUw) and the extent to which different bilingual profiles influence order of grammatical morpheme acquisition.Method: Participants included 228 Spanish-English bilingual children ages 4;0-7;6 (years;months). Grammatical morpheme accuracy was evaluated using an experimental version of the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment (Pena, Gutierrez-Clellen, Iglesias, Goldstein, & Bedore, 2014). MLUw data were calculated from children's narrative samples. Production accuracy of plural nouns, singular and plural definite articles, preterite tense, imperfect aspect, direct object clitics, prepositions, subjunctive, and conjunctions was calculated and analyzed as a function of MLUw in Spanish. Level of accuracy on these forms was compared for Spanish-dominant and English-dominant groups.Results: Accuracy was significantly associated with MLUw. The relative difficulty of Spanish grammatical morphemes is highly similar across different bilingual profiles.Conclusions: There are common elements of Spanish that are easy (imperfect, plural nouns, singular articles, conjunctions), medium (plural articles, preterite), or hard (prepositions, direct object clitics, subjunctive), regardless of whether a child is a Spanish-dominant or English-dominant bilingual.

An evaluation of the effects of art on vocabulary learning through multi-sensory modalities,"This study investigates the effects of multi-sensory art modalities on vocabulary acquisition. The following art modalities were examined: (a) visuals and (tactile) (b) music (auditory) and kinetics. Thus 60 primary students of public schools were surveyed. Data were collected through the student interest inventory and three experimental pre-tests and post-tests were run before and after the treatment period which lasted three month. Independent t-tests analyses were used and the findings revealed that there was a significant difference between teaching English through visual, tactile, and the development of language learners at the beginner level. The results showed that the teaching English can be affected through visual and tactile modalities (p<0.05). This study suggests that English language teachers should be encouraged the learners to use artistic modalities more consciously than they are currently used.

Number dissimilarities facilitate the comprehension of relative clauses in children with (Grammatical) Specific Language Impairment,"This study investigates whether number dissimilarities on subject and object DPs facilitate the comprehension of subject-and object-extracted centre-embedded relative clauses in children with Grammatical Specific Language Impairment (G-SLI). We compared the performance of a group of English-speaking children with G-SLI (mean age: 12; 11) with that of two groups of younger typically developing (TD) children, matched on grammar and receptive vocabulary, respectively. All groups were more accurate on subject-extracted relative clauses than object-extracted ones and, crucially, they all showed greater accuracy for sentences with dissimilar number features (i.e., one singular, one plural) on the head noun and the embedded DP. These findings are interpreted in the light of current psycholinguistic models of sentence comprehension in TD children and provide further insight into the linguistic nature of G-SLI.

"[""An Analysis of Compliment-Response in High School Japanese Textbooks under the 2007 Revised National Curriculum"", ""2007년 개정 「고등학교 일본어Ⅰ」에 나타난 칭찬화행""]","The textbook plays an important role in Japanese Language Learning, particularly in the Japanese as a Foreign Language classroom where it provides the primary form of linguistic input. The purpose of this study was to analyze the Compliment-Response in High School Japanese Textbooks that are used in high schools in Korea under the National Curriculum revised in 2007. Using textbooks analysis methods, the study investigated the Compliment-Response in terms of compliment topic, compliment response strategies and adjacency pairs. Results are as follows. 1) In the compliment topic point of view there was no significant difference between daily Japanese conversation and topics used in high school Japanese textbooks. Personal capabilities such as skills in painting, Japanese and singing are commonly used in daily Japanese conversation as well as in dialogs in Japanese textbooks.Therefore compliment topics appeared in high school Japanese textbooks reflect the Japanese linguistic behavior relatively well. 2) In terms of compliment response strategies, 'Evade' is used most frequently in daily Japanese conversation whereasmajority of high schoolJapanese textbooks often used 'Reject' as the compliment response strategies. 3) In the context of existence of adjacency pairs, the study found that in many cases, dialogs in high school Japanese textbooks have only compliments itself without any compliment-responses. In conclusion, Compliment-Response in the Japanese textbook was different from that of the Japanese. The results show that the textbooks don’t reflect the daily life of the Japanese and also may mislead the learner with wrong perception when they learn Japanese language. Therefore, it is necessary to observe native Japanese speakers’ conversations and apply the findings of the Conversation Analysis to the textbook revision. Implications suggest that textbook developers could include authentic examples of speech acts and sufficient explanations to facilitate acquisition of communication competence.

English Verb Accuracy of Bilingual Cantonese-English Preschoolers,"Purpose: Knowledge of verb development in typically developing bilingual preschoolers may inform clinicians about verb accuracy rates during the 1st 2 years of English instruction. This study aimed to investigate tensed verb accuracy in 2 assessment contexts in 4- and 5-year-old Cantonese-English bilingual preschoolers.Method: The sample included 47 Cantonese-English bilinguals enrolled in English preschools. Half of the children were in their 1st 4 months of English language exposure, and half had completed 1 year and 4 months of exposure to English. Data were obtained from the Test of Early Grammatical Impairment ( Rice & Wexler, 2001) and from a narrative generated in English.Results: By the 2nd year of formal exposure to English, children in the present study approximated 33% accuracy of tensed verbs in a formal testing context versus 61% in a narrative context. The use of the English verb BE approximated mastery. Predictors of English third-person singular verb accuracy were task, grade, English expressive vocabulary, and lemma frequency.Conclusions: Verb tense accuracy was low across both groups, but a precocious mastery of BE was observed. The results of the present study suggest that speech-language pathologists may consider, in addition to an elicitation task, evaluating the use of verbs during narratives in bilingual Cantonese-English children.

Simulating the Acquisition of Verb Inflection in Typically Developing Children and Children With Developmental Language Disorder in English and Spanish,"Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) have significant deficits in language ability that cannot be attributed to neurological damage, hearing impairment, or intellectual disability. The symptoms displayed by children with DLD differ across languages. In English, DLD is often marked by severe difficulties acquiring verb inflection. Such difficulties are less apparent in languages with rich verb morphology like Spanish and Italian. Here we show how these differential profiles can be understood in terms of an interaction between properties of the input language, and the child's ability to learn predictive relations between linguistic elements that are separated within a sentence. We apply a simple associative learning model to sequential English and Spanish stimuli and show how the model's ability to associate cues occurring earlier in time with later outcomes affects the acquisition of verb inflection in English more than in Spanish. We relate this to the high frequency of the English bare form (which acts as a default) and the English process of question formation, which means that (unlike in Spanish) bare forms frequently occur in third-person singular contexts. Finally, we hypothesize that the pro-drop nature of Spanish makes it easier to associate person and number cues with the verb inflection than in English. Since the factors that conspire to make English verb inflection particularly challenging for learners with weak sequential learning abilities are much reduced or absent in Spanish, this provides an explanation for why learning Spanish verb inflection is relatively unaffected in children with DLD.

This study observed learner uptakes, which produced positive effects on language acquisition and correlations between learner uptakes and types of effective focus on form episodes and feedbacks. A total of 193 meaningful focus-on-form episodes from this study and 182 learner uptakes were examined among these. The types of reactive episodes were used more frequently than teacher-initiated and learner-initiated preemptive episodes, bearing contrary results to those found in adult ESL classrooms. Nine types of feedbacks were observed and among these, 'Recast Feedback' was used at the highest rate for uptakes. In conclusion, the integrated focus on form communicative instruction using English songs and storybooks showed to produce positive effects on the improvement of English competence in children. Consequently, reactive focus-on-form episodes and recast feedbacks are significantly effective methods to help childhood English language development.

THE BREADTH OF RECEPTIVE VOCABULARY KNOWLEDGE AMONG ENGLISH MAJOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,"Vocabulary knowledge is a key component for literacy skills as well as the development of communication deemed important for students to succeed in university. Gaining adequate receptive vocabulary knowledge would enhance a university student's comprehension of academic texts. This descriptive study aims to investigate the receptive vocabulary knowledge among English major university students in Malaysia and Thailand. The sample comprises 80 English major students from Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Malaysia and 86 English major students from Prince Songkla University (PSU), Thailand. A Vocabulary Size Test (VST) adopted from Nation and Beglar was employed to gather the primary data from the respondents about their receptive vocabulary knowledge. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 was used for data analysis. Results showed that, on average, UniSZA students had a higher VST score (44.64%) compared to that of PSU students (20.92%). The higher average score gained by UniSZA students was mainly due to early exposure to formal English education in schools. This study recommends preparing students with explicit academic vocabulary instruction, particularly in the beginning semester of an English programme, to meet the academic and professional needs of English major students in future.

"[""Analysis of grammatical errors in English writing of elementary students"", ""초등 학습자의 영어 쓰기에 나타난 문법 오류 분석""]","The purpose of this study is to analyze grammatical errors in English writing of elementary students and to compare the aspects of grammatical errors of students amongst three different groups in an attempt to explore effective ways of teaching grammar and writing. The grammatical errors were classified into four categories of addition, omission, substitution, and word order. Within each category, the errors were again classified into ten sub-items which include verbs, articles, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, punctuation, and capital/small letters. The number of errors and its proportion from certain sub-items were calculated to identify the frequent grammatical errors. The results of the study suggested that the most frequent grammatical errors were verb errors, which were mainly the third person singular verb errors, errors of tense, overgenerated be-verb errors. The next frequent type of errors was the omission of articles. Errors of punctuation and classification of capital and small letters also appeared frequently. In addition, the aspects of errors occurred in three leveled groups indicated similar results but showed slight differences in specific error patterns. The findings of this study are to understand the difficulties of learning English grammar rules and discover the effective ways of teaching grammar that can help the students overcome the difficulties with learning grammar aspects.

The development of determiners in the context of French-English bilingualism: a study of cross-linguistic influence,"This paper reports the preliminary results of a study examining the role of structural overlap, language exposure, and language use on cross-linguistic influence (CLI) in bilingual first language acquisition. We focus on the longitudinal development of determiners in a corpus of two French-English children between the ages of 2;4 and 3;7. The results display bi-directional CLI in the rate of development, i.e., accelerated development in English and a minor delay in French. Unidirectional CLI from English to French was instead observed in the significantly higher rate of ungrammatical determiner omissions in plural and generic contexts than in singular specific contexts in French. These findings suggest that other language-internal mechanisms may be at play. They also lend support to the role of expressive abilities on the magnitude of this phenomenon.

Education)This study aims to develop efficient vocabulary teaching methods to help third & fourth grade students master and actively use abstract words, to provide teachers with them along with their examples, and to help them teach elementary students abstract words more effectively. First, the basic vocabulary words in the English curriculum of elementary school are analyzed as follows. 1. They are divided into the two categories, function words(10%) and content words(90%). 2. They are further divided into the two categories, concrete words(35%) and abstract words(65%). 3. Among the abstract words, there are more verbs than any other word class(adjectives, nouns, and adverbs). 4. They are again divided with regard to the features of each word class as follows. Verbs are grouped into dynamic verbs and stative verbs; nouns into common, and collective material nouns; adjectives into character or state adjectives and number or amount adjectives. Next, Efficient teaching methods for each word group according to their characteristics are offered as follows: a) Action verbs: Use body movements or action, and correlations in meaning. b) Stative verbs: Use a chant. c) Common nouns: Use storytelling and drawings. d) Collective material nouns: Use the hyponym. e) Character or state adjectives: Use diagrams, sense relations, simple poems, and mime. f) Number or amount adjectives: Use picture cards.

To achieve this aim, this study wanted to find out how well 81 Korean English learners(43 middle school, 38 high school) understand the usage of non-explicit language. Furthermore 9 Korean English teachers in middle and high schools were surveyed on how to teach non-explicit language. Specifically, experiments 1 & 2 and one questionnaire were conducted. The findings of the current study suggest the following two results. First, As the Korean English learners increase their learning levels, they are able to acquire explicit language rules relatively well, but not non-explicit language. Second, Korean English teachers in schools said that they have not provided explicit teaching approaches about the non-explicit language in the schools’ educational environment.

In the Returnee Class as Sheltered Program the ultimate objective over the education period of a year or so is to help the students with insufficient capabilities of the Korean language to better understand the learning material and to assist with the classroom adaptation so that they may join a regular class soon, which in terms of the content was distinct from bilingual education or immersion English program targeted at maintaining international qualities, that are expected from the parents. However the Returnee Class as Sheltered Program has demonstrated that it can provide various layers of educational experience through its theme-based integrated curriculum, which was ran for the adaptation of returnee students in such areas as culture, school life, language and subject learning. Theme-based integrated curriculum was run based on Sheltered Content-Based Instruction, in which the core learning content is set as the Big Idea and these topics are linked to related content in various subjects so that language and subject content are naturally taught together.Also through the analysis of the Korean language class for returnee students it has come to light that teaching in this class was based on the learning objective in standard Korean language education curriculum using the regular Korean language textbooks, but the conditions in Korean language education had been adjusted to meet the needs of students whose Korean language skills are insufficient. The distinct features of the Returnee Class as Sheltered Program can be identified as providing comprehensible input, making sense of core concepts by explaining with English words, emphasizing the training of reading fluency through choral reading, emphasizing the meaning and usage of vocabulary, inducing in-depth learning by emphasizing metacognitive knowledge of Korean language, lowering the affective filter level of students by adjusting the speed of speech and teaching, and running class flexibly by restructuring the learning content and curriculum.

"[""Research on three elementary English teachers’ practical knowledge"", ""세 초등영어교사의 실천적 지식 연구""]","The purpose of this study is to analyze and understand the elementary English teachers’ practical knowledge in their teaching activities. To achieve these goals, three different English classes were observed twice and the respective English teachers were interviewed later on. Furthermore, lesson plans and supplemental documents were also submitted. The Constant Comparative Method (CCM) was used by Nvivo 10 to explore the teachers’ practical knowledge. The following conclusions were made regarding the present study: Firstly, teachers have general practical knowledge through previous teaching experience. When they plan and choose activities, they consider which factors have the greatest impact on students. With that in mind, classes were conducted according to students’ level, interests, and students’ confidence. Second, all three teachers had a common interest in learning English. Such interest was exemplified as all three teachers pursued post-graduate degrees in English education and participated in English training programs for teachers which greatly influenced their practical nowledge formation. Thirdly, teachers had a preference in using the following five activities: joyful games and vocabulary-centered activity, songs and chants which positively motivated students, collaborative group activity, drama (mini-play) which can put students in communicative situations, and displaying realistic video clips.

"Plural variation in L1 and early L2 acquisition of German: social, dialectal and methodological factors","Due to high variation and competition of different potential forms, German noun plural formation is known to be challenging for children acquiring German as their first or second language. In order to disentangle linguistic, social and methodological factors, we investigate the acquisition of German noun plurals in 56 kindergarten children living in Vienna (Austria) at four data points from mean ages 3;1 to 4;8. The groups of children were balanced for socio-economic status, language background and gender. We use two different methodologies: (1) a picture-based plural elicitation test in which the plural is formed on the basis of a singular given by the experimenter, (2) spontaneous production data in kindergarten settings. Results demonstrate effects of linguistic background, socio-economic status and methodology: Monolingual high SES children score highest in both settings, but the SES and language gap is greater in the test than in spontaneous speech. If dialect forms are treated as correct plurals, the effects of SES and language background are slightly attenuated. We argue for the use of mixed-methods designs in research projects in order to get a comprehensive picture of children's linguistic proficiencies, especially when investigating vulnerable populations.

EARLY OLD ENGLISH FOOT STRUCTURE,"The variable operation of high vowel deletion in Old English has long been a point of difficulty, both descriptively - a prehistoric form like *heafudu is attested variably as heafudu, heafdu, and heafod - and theoretically. Recent work, especially by Bermudez-Otero (2005b) and Fulk (2010), has indicated that plural forms like heafudu are most likely original, but accounting for why the medial *u is preserved in this case form, and not in heafde, the dative singular of the same word, has remained theoretically problematic. These difficulties arise from attempting to describe the prehistoric Old English process of high vowel deletion on the basis of later Old English phonology. At an earlier stage, the nominative-accusative plural *heafudu could be exhaustively parsed into two precisely bimoraic feet: *[hea][.fu.du]. The dative singular historically ended with a long vowel, *heafud?, in which the medial *u could not be accommodated within a bimoraic foot: *[hea].fu[.d?]. High vowel deletion is therefore best characterized as the deletion of unfooted high vowels in early Old English, initially operating while length in unstressed vowels remained contrastive. Both this quantitative system and the preference for precisely bimoraic units receive support from Kaluza's law, an archaic metrical phenomenon in Beowulf which prohibits resolution in secondary metrical ictus if the resulting unit would have more than two moras, and which is sensitive to prehistoric length distinctions. This original system was obscured, linguistically and metrically, in later Old English by the shortening of unstressed long vowels, triggering various morphological reanalyses of the effects of high vowel deletion. A review of these changes suggests that the system of metrical phonology described here provides a more plausible starting point for the reworkings that produced the forms found in later Old English than do alternative accounts such as those of Campbell (1983) or Ringe (2002).

Acquisition of English grammatical morphology by native Mandarin-speaking children and adolescents: Age-related differences,"Purpose: This 5-year longitudinal study investigated the acquisition of 6 English grammatical morphemes (i.e., regular and irregular past tense, 3rd person singular, progressive aspect -ing, copula BE, and auxiliary DO) by 10 native Mandarin-speaking children and adolescents in the United States (arrived in the United States between 5 and 16 years of age). The goals were to chart and compare the acquisition trajectories and levels of mastery across the morphemes, identify when age-related differences emerged and which forms they took.Method: Morphological proficiency was measured by the accuracy of these morphemes in obligatory contexts during spontaneous speech.Results: The morphemes were mastered by different numbers of participants and showed different growth trajectories. Performance variance was partially predicted by age of arrival (AoAr) in the United States, with early arrivals achieving greater proficiency than late arrivals. However, such AoAr effects took several years to occur and only existed for 2 of the 6 morphemes (i.e., 3rd person singular and regular post tense). Growth curve analysis revealed that language environment was a stronger predictor of individual differences than AoAr. Results did not uncover age-related differences in the acquisition of tense versus non-tense-related morphemes, nor in regular versus irregular morphemes, nor in the error types.Conclusion: Findings support an Environmental account for age-related differences in 2nd language (1-2) morphological acquisition. Results also indicate that the acquisition of some grammatical morphemes by school-aged immigrants takes several years to complete. As L2 learners exhibit some error types and difficulties similar to monolingual children with specific language impairment, caution needs to be taken when interpreting and using morphological errors as indicators of speech/ language learning problems in this population.

Spanish-speaking children's use of verbal inflection in comprehension,"This paper examines children's use of verbal agreement in comprehension in two varieties of Spanish with the goal of determining how the input affects their behavior. Both dialects are identical in allowing null subjects and having rich verbal morphology in contrast to English. The dialects differ however in that in Chilean Spanish a phonological lenition process affects the realization of second person singular /-s/. In Mexican Spanish, no such variation is found for the second singular. The results indicate that children acquiring languages with rich verbal morphology use agreement in comprehension in much the same way as children acquiring a language with less robust agreement. Moreover, we find that variable input for the second singular marker affects acquisition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"[""Песни и театральные постановки в обучении английскому языку"", ""Songs and drama integrated in EFL learning""]","At present there is a growing concern among language teachers about developing non-traditional approaches to bridge the gap between classroom settings and real life situations. The article is intended to reveal the rich potential of musical performances based on the use of educational drama and songs in EFL teaching. The ever-increasing amount of research articles in various fields ranging from cognitive science and psycholinguistics to anthropology and sociolinguistics - to name just a few - highlight numerous benefits of the evolving trend. However a complex approach to integrating songs and drama in EFL learning has not so far received all the attention it deserves. The authors discuss an attempt at elaborating such an approach largely targeting young students in a L1 setting, its primary goal being to make them more motivated and receptive to language learning. We start by a brief overview of the present day state of the art, then move on to outlining the concept of the ELT Theatre and its implications for EFL learning, and finally illustrate some options of systemically implementing the approach offered to organising extra-curriculum at different stages of language acquisition.

Literacy Development through Proper Technologies in Teaching English to Young Learners,"A literature review was conducted to describe the knowledge of Teaching English to Young Learners (TEYL) through technology aimed to develop literacy in this 21st century. English is one of the languages in this world which should be mastered. Related to the language, language development is one of the development aspects in early childhood education curriculum 2013. In the teaching practices, there are countless media which could be used, particularly motion picture and song through technology. The technology usage in the digital era aims to assist the teachers to deliver the materials and to assist the children to comprehend the materials through amusement ways. Moreover, literacy development for young learners through phonics method may influence the language skills in English. Hence, the teachers should be able to employ the proper media through technology in teaching English to young learners which could support the children in developing the literacy. It may provoke the teaching practices in the classroom lively for instance motivating the learners in the learning process, providing fun and joyful ambiences, improving the learners. language skills, and enriching the vocabulary. The usage of proper media through technology in TEYL may improve and enhance the children's literacy in early years.

Both teachers and students have answered that ‘games’, ‘songs’ and ‘chants’ are the most preferred teaching methods. With regard to the degree of participation for a specific method, there was some discrepancy between teachers’ and the students’ perception. This implies that teachers need to be more aware of how the students actually feel in the class. Teachers suggested that applying various teaching methods is important to increase the students’ interest and acquisition.

"[""Korean Acceptance and Misconception of Immanent Approach in Germany: Implication on North Korea Studies"", ""독일 내재적 접근의 한국적 수용과 오해: 북한연구에 대한 함의""]","This article aims to critically review misperception on “immanent approach” that Song Doo-Yul had introduced as a new approach of North Korea Studies in 1988, in terms of semantic analysis and methodology. Thus, the primary purpose of the work is not only to rectify equivocal vocabulary that Song had heedlessly interpreted, but also to think better of immanent approach in North Korea Studies. Firstly, Song may fall in etymologic inaccuracy that had not made a distinction between ‘transzendental’ and ‘transznedent’ in the German language: Song had contrasted ‘immanent’ with ‘transzendental’, but semantically ‘tranzendent’ rather than ‘transzendental’. So to speak, the antonym of ‘immanent’ is not external, but ‘transcendent’ in English.Secondly, “Immanent approach” that presented in South Korea has made a false representation of its meanings and subject matters in terms of “approach”. In this regard, Song's works could not help being insufficient owing to lack of references and adequate understanding to immanent approach.Finally, many researches wrapped around immanent approach can be “quasi-totalitarian approach” as a transmitted form in terms of the classification of approach. Because it is exhausting in internal disputes that researchers shall tell 'immanent' from ‘transcendent’, the works that reclassifies “approaches” are an unproductive endeavor. Different theorists, however, need to reflect what they are doing. As a authority cited, North Korea Studies in South Korea must reconsider meta-theoretical approach: Ontological-Normative, Empirical- analytical, Dialectical-Critical. In brief, this request may be confuted as eurocentric or German-centric, but it is convinced that meta-theoretical deliberation should be the only alternatives to surmount underdeveloped tendency of the theory in North Korea Studies.

PRONOUNS OF ADDRESS IN SPANISH-LANGUAGE TEXTBOOKS - THE CASE FOR VOS,"The voseo is a frequently used second person singular form of address in many New World varieties of Spanish. Unfortunately, most textbooks of Spanish regularly treat the use of tri, usted, ustedes, and vosotros, but ignore vos. This article includes a survey of 37 first-year secondary and postsecondary Spanish textbooks for their coverage of the voseo. All texts were carefully analyzed via a page-by-page survey of explanations, tables of contents, readings, marginal glosses, and indexes. Results of the survey revealed that only 16 percent of the analyzed texts included any reference to the voseo. The article also makes recommendations for the inclusion of the voseo in future textbooks of Spanish and in class instruction. Indeed, the vos may be considered as the simple addition of one more vocabulary item that could improve students' communicative competence in Spanish.Several factors support an increased attention on vos: our students have contact with a number of native speakers who regularly use vos. This contact is between our students and Central and South Americans both as immigrants in the United Stares and through contact with native speakers when our students travel and study in Central and South America, Therefore, the ever-increasing contact with dialect speakers exhibiting vos requires increased attention to this important form of address in pedagogical materials and class lessons at all levels.

THE AMCO METHOD,"Bases1. English language teaching through immersion in Only English classes that support the change of codes or switching process as proposed by the Generation Voice Theory.2. Development of auditory discrimination skills of English phonetic sounds through systematic and specific exercises.3. Integrated learning of language and contents in order to renew and enrich perspectives in both subject matters and motivate students at the same time.4. Enhancement of students' own capabilities through strategies based on the Theory of Multiple Intelligences.5. Emphasis on meaningful and constructivist learning through the planning of preactivities and postactivities.6. Constant flow of thinking skills through the expression of thinking processes, the application of decisions and the creation of new ideas.7. Use of mind maps to visualize connections among ideas.8. Development of group interaction strategies and planning of collaborative activities in class.With the AMCO method students learn a second language as spontaneously as they acquired their mother tongue. The Amco method is based on studies that demonstrate children learn to build relationships with the world through different communication codes; by them they express ideas, experiences, needs and feelings using gestures, attitudes, behaviors, voices and language tones in all possible shapes.These theories are based on the following concepts:- It is necessary to use both hemispheres to obtain a code of communications in the process of second language acquisition.- The sooner a child starts learning a second language, the better.- When more brain zones are stimulated through visual material, intonation, gesticulation, mimicry, facial expressions, music, games and more, the degree of comprehension and retention of the concept will be greater.- It is crucial to involve the student in the teaching-learning process in an active mode, not just as a receptor of the information provided by the teacher.- It is critical that knowledge becomes an ""experience"" for the child to ""own"" the information and use it whenever is required.- It is necessary for the child to think in the language he is acquiring. This happens when translating from his native language is avoided, and when children are motivated with games, group dynamics, and real experiences for practicing the second language rather than activities and tasks in traditional learning. The goal is thinking in the language being learnt. The child should develop communication codes in a natural way, creating ""storing spaces"" in their minds where recording the information from each language separately without translating from one to another. Our teaching methodology includes:- Multiple Intelligences, according to Ph.D. Howard Gardner's theory;- the importance of Emotional Intelligence, demonstrated among other people by Daniel Goleman;- Bloom's Taxonomy, that develops a classification of learning objectives and skills within education;- knowledge embodying tools, such as Tony Buzan's mind maps;- interaction strategies such as cooperative learning by David Johnson and Robert Johnson;- Visible Thinking, Project Zero-Harvard University, an approach to teaching and learning that emphasizes the use of thinking routines and documentation to make thinking more visible in classrooms;- project-based learning, that promotes and practices new learning habits, emphasizing creative thinking skills by allowing students to find that there are many ways to solve a problem.

Proposals to carry the grammar to the students,"The Spanish educational law for the subject of Language, especially in Secondary school, implies that students have to learn to think over linguistic contents and learn the specific metalinguistic terminology. After a hard work, most of the students learn to use correctly terms such as Subject, Direct Object, linking element, perfect aspect, etc. However, in spite of this learning, most of them still do not understand what these terms mean or why they have to learn them. Consequently, they also do not understand why morphology and grammar are not synonymous terms, why languages without grammar do not exist, why the verb of impersonal sentences is in 3rd singular person, etc. Considering this situation, it is very unlikely that these students will be able to apply that metalinguistic knowledge to learn other languages. Besides, it is also very unlikely that future teachers will be able to teach properly those grammatical contents. Given that, the aim of this paper is to show the semantic interpretation of grammatical and metalinguistic terms, and consequently make easier their learning and understanding. In order to do that two tools are used: visual representation and cross-linguistic comparisons.

The *amn't gap: The view from West Yorkshire,"The absence of I amn't for the first person Singular present tense negative form is taken to indicate that there is a gap in the paradigm. Recent accounts take a morphosyntactic approach and phonology is largely ignored. Such accounts typically focus on contemporary forms of Standard English. This paper, in contrast, compares nineteenth-century and contemporary West Yorkshire (WY) aux+n't forms and pursues a largely phonological solution. The paper sets out to demonstrate that WY has never had a *amn't gap and that changes over the past century shed light on the *amn't gap problem. Contemporary WY is known to exhibit a phenomenon called secondary contraction, whereby shouldn't [judn?], for example, may be pronounced [fun?]. I argue that secondary contraction is responsible for the creation of homophones for amn't and aren't: [amt]/[art]. I will consider the possibility that certain MIX +n't forms have become lexicalised and that this has triggered secondary contraction as a phonological repair strategy. With the analysis of WY data as a backdrop, the paper then pursues the possibility that lexicalisation may have occurred, at a much earlier date, in precursors of Standard British English (SBE). Indeed, it seems Plausible that homophony for amn't and aren't may have led to prescription against new realisations of amn't. The paper will show that grammatically amn't has evolved in exactly the same way as other auxn't forms, and it is only commentators who have treated it differently. If this is so, the *amn't gap in SBE is man-made rather than grammatical in nature.

Does Knowledge of Grammar Influence Productive Speaking Skills of the Students of Russian Departments? (on the Example of a Questionnaire of Czech and Slovak Students),"This paper presents the results of a comparative survey of university students studying Russian as a foreign language, aimed at exploring their ability to apply the knowledge of the grammar system of the Russian language in practice. The ability to produce the required forms of verbs, specifically the first person of the singular and the plural, and determine the aspect of verbs as a learning skill was studied. The survey results show a positive correlation between the level of knowledge of the grammar system of the Russian language and the ability to produce the correct forms of unfamiliar lexical units. The production of the correct form was not represented in the verbs equally. The common feature of the Czech and Slovak students was that the best and worst results were achieved with the same verbs. The best results were connected with the production of the forms of verbs such as etc. The students produced correct forms in more than 80%. The other group consisted of verbs which turned out to be the most difficult for the experiment participants. Among them were such verbs as and Unlike the previous group, the variants of the incorrect forms formed from the verbs were much more diverse. The proportion of correct answers for any of these verbs did not exceed 20%, the most difficult for students was the verb the number of correct answers averaged 6%. Determining the verb aspect was more successful than conjugation of verbs, yet many students produced the verb form incorrectly. The score of the Slovak students, compared with their Czech colleagues, was lower. In senior courses, success in determining the type of verb generally increased. A comparative study of the specific skills of students studying Russian language from two faculties of different universities is an example of how to test the skills of students in practice within the framework of competencies, the development of which is the main goal of education in the basic, secondary, and higher education     PU  - URAL STATE PEDAGOGICAL UNIV     PI  - YEKATERINBURG     PA  - PR-KT KOSMONAVTOV, 26, YEKATERINBURG, 620017, RUSSIA",0
CHANGING PLACES: TOWARD THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DANCED FANDANGO,"The fandango, as a dance craze adopted by the aristocracy of 18th century Spain and propagated in elite concert halls and salons, derived from the communal celebrations of the lowest rungs of Spanish and Spanish-American society. Indeed, its widespread popularity is inextricably linked to the great social, economic, and cultural shifts of the Enlightenment, with its elevation and representation of the popular. Yet the popular fandangos, interpreted in aristocratic settings and recorded in the cifras of court musicians, dance treatises, libretti of ballets, operas, and tonadillas, as by elite observers and foreign tourists, have themselves been lost to time. Therefore, we wonder, is it possible to reconstruct a danced fandango from the 18th century? What can primary sources tell us about the movement vocabulary, the choreography, and the rhythms of the fandango? Beyond that, how can we kinesthetically grasp the supposed lasciviousness that, along with the fandango's representation of the popular, universally characterizes this dance?

Variable Input and the Acquisition of Plural Morphology,"The present article examines the effect of variable input on the acquisition of plural morphology in two varieties of Spanish: Chilean Spanish, where the plural marker is sometimes omitted due to a phonological process of syllable final /s/lenition, and Mexican Spanish (of Mexico City), with no such lenition process. The goal of the study is to determine whether variable input for grammatical morphology affects the acquisition process. Does the ambiguous nature (sometimes present and sometimes absent) of a form affect acquisition? To address this question, Experiment 1 examines the production of the plural marker in Chilean-and Mexican Spanish-speaking children, and Experiments 2 and 3 examine children's use of plural and singular indefinite noun phrases in comprehension. The results indicate that variable input affects acquisition, with Chilean children taking longer to acquire the plural marker than Mexican children.

VALUATING THE EFFICIENCY OF NLP APPLICATIONS VIA ADAPTING SONGS TO TEACH ENGLISH VOCABULARY TO YOUNG LEARNERS,"This experimental study aims to investigate the effects of songs applied with Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques in the classroom on teaching vocabulary to young learners (YLs). To this end, the experiment was carried out with two groups of fifth grade primary school students. The students in the control group were taught the vocabulary via traditional methods and techniques without using any songs and other supplementary materials. Nevertheless, the experimental group was instructed through songs which are utilized to teach the new words through NLP techniques and principles. The treatment lasted for four weeks. In each treatment, the experimental group received an instruction of a class hour, 40 minutes. The new words to be taught in the last four units of the course book were previously chosen and included in the songs that were composed. A week later after each instruction, a post-test was administered to both control and experimental groups to observe the effects of the treatment and the difference between the test scores of the students in the control group and those of the students in the experimental group. The findings showed that the students in the experimental group received higher marks than those in the control group, which can be interpreted that songs and activities prepared according to NLP principles and techniques improved vocabulary retention of YLs while learning English.

Testing theories of plural meanings,"Plural morphology in English is associated with a multiplicity inference. For example, ""Emily fed giraffes"" is typically interpreted to mean that Emily fed multiple giraffes. It has long been observed that this inference dis-appears in downward-entailing linguistic environments, such as in the scope of negation. For example, ""Emily didn't feed giraffes"" does not merely suggest that she didn't feed multiple giraffes, but rather that she didn't feed any. There are three main approaches to explaining this puzzle: the first proposes that the plural is ambiguous, and invokes a preference for stronger meanings; the second derives multiplicity inferences as implicatures; and the third provides a homogeneity-based account. These different approaches can all account for the interpretation of the plural across upwardand downward-entailing environments. They differ, however, in what they predict for three further aspects of the plural: the status of positive and negative plural sentences in singular contexts, childreYn's acquisition of plural meanings, and the relationship between plural meanings and scalar implicatures. In this paper, we report on three experiments investigating adults' and preschool-aged children's interpretation of plural morphology in English. The experiments reveal that participants distinguish positive and negative plural sentences presented in singular contexts, and that adults assign a different status to these positive and negative sentences. It is also observed that children, unlike adults, tend to accept underinformative positive plural sentences in singular contexts - in parallel with their behavior on standard scalar implicatures - while they are relatively more adult-like when it comes to negative plural sentences in the same contexts, showing a tendency to reject the negative sentences. We discuss how the findings of the three experiments are expected on a scalar implicature approach to multiplicity inferences, and the open challenges they pose for the ambiguity and homogeneity approaches.

"A comparative study on primary pupils' historical questioning processes in Turkey and England: Empathic, critical and creative thinking","This study is part of a larger ongoing Project. In this project, the documents (video recordings and transcripts) which were collected by the recording of history lessons that were taught in different countries, have been analyzed in order to identify ways in which children are involved in historical enquiry rather than didactic teaching, as a basis for comparison, discussion and development. According to the project aim, in this study, history lessons taught in a primary school in Turkey and in England were comparatively analyzed. In the Turkish lesson, pupils work in groups to interpret information in texts, maps,and pictures, in order to reconstruct events surrounding the Battle of Ankara in poetry, art, drama and music. In the English lesson, children found out about Ancient Egypt's ways of daily life, also working in groups. The data gathered from these lessons -through a case study in England and an action research in Turkey- were recorded via video and the video recordings were transcribed. The documents were analyzed through, document and descriptive analyses. The analysis explores ways in which pupils extract information, transfer it to new contexts and express it from different viewpoints. It shows how, in discussing sources, pupils gradually become independent of adult support, spontaneously use special vocabulary introduced by the teacher in new contexts and use causal vocabulary. It is concluded that pupils arc engaged in the process of historical enquiry to the extent that, in an embryonic way, they explore the past, interrogate sources to construct interpretations which include presenting the information from different perspectives and developing arguments, using specialised vocabulary. The significance of classroom organisation and ethos in developing historical enquiry is considered.

"[""Korean primary English learners’ use of linguistic context and propositional information in the judgment of count nouns"", ""초등영어 학습자의 가산명사 판정에서 언어적 맥락과 명제적 정보의 활용""]","This study examined whether Korean learners of primary English effectively use linguistic context and propositional information to judge the acceptability of English count nouns. To this end, 44 fourth-graders at a primary school in Incheon participated in two tasks of acceptability judgment: sentence-based and picture-based. To make correct judgments about sentences containing count nouns, they had to use the linguistic contexts in the sentence-based task (i.e. determiners preceding the object nouns: e.g. two cats/*cat) and the propositional information in the picture-based task (i.e. number of the referent in each image: e.g. two dogs in a picture). Every sentence began with the 1st-person singular pronoun I and a past-tense verb and ended with a locative or temporal adverb phrase to make the number-related morpheme of the object noun less salient. While the participants showed similar levels of means and standard deviations in the two tasks, the between-task correlation was found to be insignificant, which implies that the participants varied from one another in their use of linguistic context and propositional information. In the sentence-based task, they appeared to be less capable of using linguistic context, especially when they had to reject the sentences with incorrect number forms such as a *cups. In the picture-based task, they were less able to use propositional information in the pictures to make correct judgments about count-noun forms. In particular, the mean scores were significantly lower for the items visualizing singular entities than those visualizing plural ones. Based on these findings, the present study suggests that primary English grammar education for count nouns and other basic linguistic units should systematically consider form, meaning, and use.

"What ""Mice Trap"" tells us about the mental lexicon","Level ordering has proven inadequate as a morphological theory, leaving unexplained the experimental results taken to support it as a component of innate grammar-young children's acceptance of irregular plurals in English compounds. The present study demonstrates that these results can be explained by slower access to the grammatically preferred singulars of irregular nouns when compounds are created on-line from plural stimuli. Experiments on English noun-noun compound production and on production of either singular or plural forms from the same or opposite form confirmed that more irregular than regular plurals were used in compounds, and showed that producing irregular singulars from plurals was slower than producing regular singulars. Plural responses were also slower when cue and required response number differed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

IS THERE A PREFERRED LANGUAGE STYLE FOR SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING?,"It is important to determine how technology affects learning styles in order to make changes in the classroom environment to fully support all language styles using technology in the most effective manner. The distribution of students' learning styles in four two semester college classes of Technology Assisted Language Learning in Intermediate Spanish was determined. Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory was used in this study which groups students into four learning styles: Convergers, Divergers, Assimilators, and Accommodators. A comparison of learning styles and classroom achievement showed that Convergers scored significantly lower (p value 0.05) in final grade point average than the students who were Assimilators, Divergers, and Accommodators. Final grade point average was determined on the basis of a final exam, 4 written partial exams, participation, online exercises, an oral final exam, and written compositions. Only the participation grade was statistically lower in Convergers than in students who had a preference for the other learning styles. Convergers process information through active experimentation while Assimilators process information in a reflective manner which involves visual stimuli. In a technology assisted classroom, where there were many visually stimulating tasks such as watching and analyzing movies, answering questions about online youtube songs, and chatting online, Convergers who process information through practical experiences may not have been able to process the information actively. Class participation involved group work such as asking friends about ideas regarding the environment, preparing skits and other group activities which again might not have allowed Convergers to process the information in a suitable manner for them because they prefer to work alone. In order to aid Convergers in a second language technology assisted classroom, it might be useful to add participatory activities that involve one on one exchanges such as mentoring Latino children in the community, and exercises that rely on practical applications such as writing letters to a pen pal, discussing topics online, all of which would aid Convergers to process classroom information in a practical manner and allow for individual work which should ultimately result in the acquisition of a second language at the same level as students with other learning styles.

Seventeen 20-minute English classes were video recorded and interviews with teacher and children were audio recorded.The findings of this study are as follows. First, class teachers were able to use some resources in the kindergarten such as some time other than English class, and the children in other class, and were capable of devising some engaging instructional strategies for children. Second, while much of the English language input was dependent on the texts, songs, and media, language interactions between the teacher and the children were mostly done in Korean. Third, children joined singing when they heard the songs, which does not necessarily mean they understood the song lyrics. Fourth, children learned to say two-word utterances and to acquire new vocabularies while they played card games with the aid of a teacher and more capable peers.

TUTORING: LEARNING THROUGH THE FESTIVAL OF MOORS AND CHRISTIANS. AN EXPERIENCE IN THE ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM,"The paper presented develops a proposal for the Festival of Moors and Christians of Alcoy as a cultural heritage in the elementary classroom, through Art Education. This Festival is established as one of the most important artistic and cultural traditions of the Spanish Levant developing musical art as the Festera Music (Musica Festera). It is intended that Primary students know the idiosyncrasies, traditions and the historical context surrounding the Festival. Through this teaching proposal, workshops will be developed for students to understand the social reality using the Festival as a nexus of cultural diversity and appreciate this important cultural and artistic heritage of the Valencian Community. Thus, through music, visual arts and history we initiate students into something as distinctive as this Festival.It is essential and necessary to be convinced of the importance of treating the folklore in the classroom, in this case, in the aspect of Moors and Christians and delve in the society-music relationship. The treatment of this issue has to be addressed from different perspectives such as: the music time, the music language, the instrumental expression or the musical sound, but always favouring the acquisition or extension of musical content. Likewise, we consider the visual and plastics aspects of the Festival deepening in the presence of the symbolism in it, manifesting in the wardrobe, on the most representative elements and on the change and the scenic recreation accompanying the environment itself.This proposal is seeking to promote meaningful learning and caring about the socializing and group aspect, to look for a complete holistic education that allows developing the student's personality and getting them to build their own learning and be its lead.

"[""The origin of Chinese character in bilingual edition as the Headwords and the value of DICTIONNAIRE COREEN-FRANCAIS"", ""표제어 대역 한자어의 탄생과 『한불자전』의 가치""]","DICTIONNAIRE COREEN-FRANCAIS (『韓佛字典』) from French priest Riedel (Felix-Clair Ridel) is the first full-fledged bilingual dictionary. This dictionary was launched in 1864 and it took 17 years to be published in Japan in 1880. Priest Coste received the delegation of the publication from Riedel went to Japan in 1878. In other words, even it took two years in Japan. Dictionary publisher was Levi (C. Levy) and the dictionary publishing office was the record producer Echo of Japan (L'Echo du Japon) newspaper that he had been operating. But it had mistaken the dictionary issuer to the publishing office, even academic circles has been reproduced on this fact. It shows that empirical work on the primary literature in lexicography was so important.DICTIONNAIRE COREEN-FRANCAIS is an important phase in the lexicography. First, the title structure is the written (竝記) bilingual edition (對譯) of Chinese character, which was the first attempt as a bilingual dictionary and it became the origin of the dictionary published. Unlike other dictionaries, dictionaries of this title structures are arranged in ‘Hangul headwords, roman pronunciation information, Chinese character information, the meaning of French’ order. Unlike other dictionaries, the title of the dictionary are arranged in Hangul Headwords, roman pronunciation information, Chinese character information, the French interpret information procedure. Compilers are meant to narrow the differences between the French translation corresponding to the Hangul Headwords to the fullest, the bilingual edition was recorded as Chinese character in the title section.Second, many vocabulary words are included in headwords and those reflects the characteristics of contemporary life in the world. In particular, the words have relevance to the category of tobacco and a legal. These results reflect lexicography’s intentions to depict the life of Catholics and people vividly and capture the desperate situation facing missionaries.Third, If Headwords a Chinese character, Chinese character in bilingual edition was recorded as Chinese. Otherwise, the meaning and pronunciation information was replaced by a similar Chinese characters. non-normative grammatical particle built on excellent knowledge of the language from Ridel was the act of translating the Chinese character and traditional Chinese in his own unique way.Fourth, the Chinese character in bilingual edition is professional and systematic as it referred to the contemporary Korean literature thoroughly. A major source of Chinese character in bilingual edition was Songnamjabji (『松南雜識』) of JoJaesam in the late Joseon period. And focuses on the specific Chinese character, it has a characteristic as it recorded many related vocabulary.Finally, the clerical error of Chinese character in bilingual edition requires careful attention when you use the dictionary.

The musical dramatization of the Spanish ballads in Primary Education as a tool for developing social and civic competences,"The persistence of a behaviorist methodology with traditional roots, supported by specialized teaching of subjects arranged in a deliberately disjointed manner, decreases any possible realization of interdisciplinary projects aimed at the creation of an integrated curriculum. It also impedes the proper development of basic competences set in the current educational context of European convergence. In this sense, an intertextual methodology connecting poetry and music, through musical dramatizations inspired in romances from the Spanish anthology Flor nueva de romances viejos, by Ramon Menendez Pidal, with music by the folklorist Joaquin Diaz Gonzalez, is presented in the areas of Art Education and Spanish language and Literature of Primary Education. The main aim of this project is to develop social and civic competences. The social, cooperative, expressive, communicative and playful nature of the musical dramatization, as a pedagogical tool, encourages students to improve their social skills, emotional development, committed and responsible teamwork, critical understanding of the reality represented, a respectful and supportive dialogue and, ultimately, the pursuit of peaceful and democratic coexistence, in connection with the purposes pursued in the acquisition of social and civic competences.

Finiteness systems and lexical aspect in child Polish and English,"The purpose of this research was to discover how the aspectual properties of predicate structure influence the acquisition of agreement and tense morphology in Polish and English. We investigated the corpora of six children learning each language by tracking the emergence of their verb morphology within a set of predicates in each of three categories, i.e., stative, dynamicatelic, and dynamic-telic. We used contrast as a measure of acquisition, e.g., past versus nonpast. In Polish, the age of the initial contrast in agreement and in tense was very similar for dynamic predicates, and agreement emerged before tense in stative predicates. In English, contrasts in tense preceded contrasts in agreement for dynamic predicates, but the pattern of acquisition was the same for stative predicates. The interaction of grammatical and lexical aspect permeated the pattern of the acquisition of the finite morphology. For stative predicates, finite contrasts occur exclusively in the imperfective aspect in Polish and exclusively in the nonprogressive aspect in English. In Polish, finite contrasts for atelic predicates were very likely to be found in the imperfective aspect and telic predicates in the perfective aspect. The related pattern in English was much less distinct. In Polish, when a contrast in agreement (e.g., 3rd versus 1st person singular) coincided with a contrast in tense (e.g., past versus future), all of the children demonstrated the capacity to immediately (i.e., without further development) produce the agreement contrast in both tenses. These findings indicate that the children are acquiring their knowledge of tense and agreement in a systematic manner driven by the acquisition of predicate-argument structure.

Grammatical morphology as a source of early number word meanings,"How does cross-linguistic variation in linguistic structure affect children's acquisition of early number word meanings? We tested this question by investigating number word learning in two unrelated languages that feature a tripartite singular-dual-plural distinction: Slovenian and Saudi Arabic. We found that learning dual morphology affects children's acquisition of the number word two in both languages, relative to English. Children who knew the meaning of two were surprisingly frequent in the dual languages, relative to English. Furthermore, Slovenian children were faster to learn two than children learning English, despite being less-competent counters. Finally, in both Slovenian and Saudi Arabic, comprehension of the dual was correlated with knowledge of two and higher number words.

Phonological and morphological consistency in the acquisition of vowel duration spelling in Dutch and German,"In Dutch, vowel duration spelling is phonologically consistent but morphologically inconsistent (e.g., paar-paren). In German, it is phonologically inconsistent but morphologically consistent (e.g., Paar-Paare). Contrasting the two orthographies allowed us to examine the role of phonological and morphological consistency in the acquisition of the same orthographic feature. Dutch and German children in Grades 2 to 4 spelled singular and plural word forms and in a second task identified the correct spelling of singular and plural forms of the same nonword. Dutch children were better in word spelling, but German children outperformed the Dutch children in nonword selection. Also, whereas German children performed on a similar level for singular and plural items, Dutch children showed a large discrepancy. The results indicate that children use phonological and morphological rules from an early age but that the developmental balance between the two sources of information is constrained by the specific orthography.

Can Young Learners Utilize Cartoon Picture and Song To Learn?: A teaching model,"This paper aims to deploy model of teaching English for kindergarten teachers and students using cartoon picture and song. The rationale is that they are handy, more lively and authentic in the classroom. In addition, they also promote sentence repetition which can facilitate lexical, grammatical and cultural knowledge building to children with rich input of authentic material with the real voice of native speakers and real usage of English. Six teachers including 5 females and 1 male with different academic background participate in the experiment. Also, thirty one students with 8 female and 23 male students get involve in the study. This study uses quantitative research design and therefore test and questionnaire are utilized to answer the research questions from the study. The result shows that there was significant difference improvement between pretest and post-test from both teachers and students. It specified teachers and students to their pronunciation, vocabulary, and phrases development. The questionnaire result divided into three levels: high, mid, and low showed that the interest and motivation of learners to learn by doing were included the high percentage. In summary, kindergarten teachers require more time span not only to practice their own English skills but to teach them in front of the students as well.

Numerical morphology supports early number word learning: Evidence from a comparison of young Mandarin and English learners,"Previous studies showed that children learning a language with an obligatory singular/plural distinction (Russian and English) learn the meaning of the number word for one earlier than children learning Japanese, a language without obligatory number morphology (Barner, Libenson, Cheung, & Takasaki, 2009; Sarnecka, Kamenskaya, Yamana, Ogura, & Yudovina, 2007). This can be explained by differences in number morphology, but it can also be explained by many other differences between the languages and the environments of the children who were compared. The present study tests the hypothesis that the morphological singular/plural distinction supports the early acquisition of the meaning of the number word for one by comparing young English learners to age and SES matched young Mandarin Chinese learners. Mandarin does not have obligatory number morphology but is more similar to English than Japanese in many crucial respects. Corpus analyses show that, compared to English learners, Mandarin learners hear number words more frequently, are more likely to hear number words followed by a noun, and are more likely to hear number words in contexts where they denote a cardinal value. Two tasks show that, despite these advantages, Mandarin learners learn the meaning of the number word for one three to six months later than do English learners. These results provide the strongest evidence to date that prior knowledge of the numerical meaning of the distinction between singular and plural supports the acquisition of the meaning of the number word for one.

Introducing English in Early Year's Children through Dancing and Singing,"Introducing English to early childhood has been done by a lot of Early Childhood Education institutions. Yet, the teachers lack the media and method to introduce English to the children. Teachers do not have many options of method and media. They use the same printed media repeatedly which makes the teaching process becoming dull and bores the children. Teachers need other alternative media to introduce English to the children in a fun way. Children learn through playing, therefore teachers need to provide interesting method and media to teach. By using dancing and singing, children will not only become interested in the learning process but also received adequate stimulation for their visual, auditory, and motor aspect. Such dancing and singing will be more practical if stored in the compact disk (CD). The aim of the research is to provide a guide for teacher to use and implement the dancing and singing media; to provide an alternative media in introducing English to the children; and to provide an interesting and fun learning experience for the children. Through the three themes of dancing and singing which is close to the children daily life, the teachers are able to develop or create various activities and media in introducing English to children. It also lengthens the range of concentration of the children. As a result, the children's vocabulary is enhancing.

Transfer Learning for Detecting Hateful Sentiments in Code Switched Language,"With the phenomenal increase in the penetration of social media in linguistically diverse demographic regions, conversations have become more casual and multilingual. The rise of informal code-switched multilingual languages makes it tough for automated systems to monitor instances of hate speech, which are further intelligently disguised through the use of spelling variations, code-mixing, homophones, homonyms, and the absence of sophisticated grammar rules. Machine transliteration can be employed for converting the code-switched text into a singular script but poses the challenge of the semantical breakdown of the text. To overcome this drawback, this chapter investigates the application of transfer learning. The CNN-based neural models are trained on a large dataset of hateful tweets in a chosen primary language, followed by retraining on the small transliterated dataset in the same language. Since transfer learning can act as an effective strategy to reuse already learned features in learning a specialized task through cross-domain knowledge transfer, hate speech classification on a large English corpus can act as source tasks to help in obtaining pre-trained deep learning classifiers for the target task of classifying tweets translated in English from other code-switched languages. Effects of the different types of popular word embeddings and multiple supervised inputs such as the LIWC, the presence of profanities, and sentiment are carefully studied to derive the most representative combination of input settings that can help achieve state-of-the-art hate speech detection from code-switched multilingual short texts on Twitter.

"Shared spaces, shared structures: Latino social formation and African American English in the U.S. south","This study examines the appropriation of grammatical structures of African American English (AAE) by adolescent Latinos attending a multi-ethnic middle school in North Carolina. The study couples quantitative variationist analysis of four core' grammatical features of AAE (invariant be, copula deletion, past-tense copula leveling, and third-person singular s absence) with the findings of an ethnographic study of Latino adolescent identity in order to better understand the social processes leading to the incorporation of AAE grammar into English varieties spoken by Latinos. Results show that Latino students from across social formations make use of AAE grammatical features, but differ significantly from African American students in terms of sociolinguistic patterning. Ethnographic data shed light on linguistic data in three domains: (1) differences in use of AAE structures between male and female Latino/a students; (2) the prolific use of AAE by one gang-affiliated student; and (3) the racial complexities within the ethnic category Latino.'

It advocates relevance-oriented research in investigating characteristics of problem solving and decision making processes in translating English films into Korean. Film translation is an act of communication between screenwriters and the target audience. Film translators should reveal the screenwriter’s intention as much as possible so that the target viewers can easily understand the genuine meaning of the content with minimal processing effort. In this study, three translated versions of the song, 'Do-Re-Mi' are chosen: TT1, TT2 and TT3. Each version is translated by different translators. Through comparison and analysis, it is shown through Relevance Theory that TT1 and TT2 are translated more adequately than TT3. In the movie, Maria intends to teach the basic musical notes to children effectively by using easy vocabulary from real life. Her intention is translated more accurately and smoothly in TT1 and TT2 rather than in TT3.  This paper shows conclusively that optimal relevance is achieved only when appropriate translation strategies are applied.     PU  - The Society For Teaching English Through Media",0
Learning a morphological system without a default: the Polish genitive,"The acquisition of the English past tense inflection is the paradigm example of rule learning in the child language literature and has become something of a test case for theories of language development. This is unfortunate, as the idiosyncratic properties of the English system of marking tense make it a rather unrepresentative example of morphological development. In this paper, I contrast this familiar inflection with a much more complex morphological subsystem, the Polish genitive. The genitive case has three different markers, each restricted to a different subset of nouns, in both the singular and the plural. Analysis of the spontanous speech of three children between the ages of 1;4 and 4; 11 showed that they generalized, and overgeneralized, all three singular endings. However, error rates were extremely low and there is no evidence that they treated any one ending as the 'default'. The genitive plural, on the other hand, showed a strikingly different pattern of acquisition, similar to that seen in English-speaking children learning the past tense. It is argued that in the latter two cases, the default-like character of one of the affixes is attributable to the properties of the relevant inflectional subsystems, not to the predispositions that children bring to the language-learning task.

THE GRAMMATICAL MORPHOLOGY OF HEBREW-SPEAKING CHILDREN WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT - SOME COMPETING HYPOTHESES,"Many English-speaking children with specific language impairment have unusual difficulty with grammatical morphemes such as past tense and third-person singular verb inflections and function words such as articles. Unfortunately, the source of this difficulty is not yet clear, in part because some of the possible contributing factors are confounded in English. In the present study, alternative accounts of grammatical morpheme difficulties were evaluated using children with specific language impairment who were acquiring Hebrew. We examined the grammatical morpheme production and comprehension of 15 Hebrew-speaking children with specific language impairment, 15 normally developing compatriots matched for age and 15 normally developing children matched for mean length of utterance in words. The results provided tentative support for the notion that grammatical morphemes are less difficult for children with specific language impairment if they take the form of stressed and/or lengthened syllables and if they appear in a language in which nouns, verbs, and adjectives must be inflected. The possibility that features such as person, number, and gender are missing from the underlying grammars of these children seems less likely.

On the Role of Alternatives in the Acquisition of Simple and Complex Disjunctions in French and Japanese,"When interpreting disjunctive sentences of the form 'A or B', young children have been reported to differ from adults in two ways. First, children have been reported to interpret disjunction inclusively rather than exclusively, accepting 'A or B' in contexts in which both A and B are true (Chierchia et al. 2001; Gualmini et al. 2001). Second, some children have been reported to interpret disjunction conjunctively, rejecting 'A or B' in contexts in which only one of the disjuncts is true (Paris 1973; Braine & Rumain 1981; Chierchia et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2015). In this article, we extend the investigation of children's interpretation of disjunction to include both simple and complex forms of disjunction, in two typologically unrelated languages: French and Japanese. First, given that complex disjunctions have been argued to give rise to obligatory exclusivity inferences (Spector 2014), we investigated whether the obligatoriness of the inference would play a role in the acquisition of the exclusive interpretation. Second, using a paradigm that makes the use of disjunction felicitous, we aimed to establish whether the finding of conjunctive interpretations would be replicated for both simple and complex forms of disjunction, and in languages other than English. The main findings from our experiment are that both French-and Japanese-speaking children interpreted the simple and complex disjunctions either inclusively or conjunctively; in contrast, adults generally accessed exclusive readings of both disjunctions. We argue that our results lend further support to the proposal put forth in Singh et al. (2015), according to which the reason some children compute conjunctive meanings while adults compute exclusivemeanings is that the two groups differ in their respective sets of alternatives for disjunction. Crucially, adults access conjunction as an alternative to disjunction, and compute exclusive interpretations; in contrast, children access only the individual disjuncts as alternatives, and therefore either interpret the disjunction literally or compute conjunctive inferences. More generally, our findings can be explained quite naturally within recent proposals according to which children differ from adults in the computation of scalar inferences because they are more restricted than adults in the set of scalar alternatives they can access (Barner et al. 2011; Tieu et al. 2015b, among others).

The effect of language on Chinese and American 2-and 3-year olds' small number identification,"Recent research has found that linguistic cues may affect children's number word acquisition. Two studies were undertaken to evaluate the use of singular/plural markings and small number words in Chinese and English and its effect on children's number concepts. The first study utilized the CHILDES data and investigated how singular/plural markings and number words of ""one,"" ""two,"" and ""three"" are used in Chinese and compared it with that of English. The second study entailed testing twenty-four 2.4- to 3.3-year-old Chinese- and English-speaking children on number identification tasks. Results show that the English-speaking children performed significantly better than Chinese-speaking children in identifying ""two,"" ""three,"" and ""four"" as referents for collections of multiple items but not in identifying those number words as referents for specific pluralities. Additionally, the results show that English-speaking children were more inclined to count when quantifying small number sets than Chinese-speaking children.

"[""Suggestions for English education through error type analyses of English-Korean translation in the children’s literary work"", ""아동문학작품의 번역오류유형 분석을 통한 영어교육의 방향제시""]","The purpose of this study is to analyze errors of English-Korean translation in the children’s literary work Sing Down the Moon by Scott O’Dell and to suggest a proper way to reduce those errors in English translation education. First, some mistranslated parts in the book were identified, with some alternative translations suggested by comparing with the original work. Then, after combining the error types of five researchers’, Ko(1997), Cho(1999), Cho(2001), Kim(2003), and Woo(2006), the errors were newly classified into four types of errors associated with the translation of the book: mistranslation of words, mistranslation of phrases or sentences, content omissions, and content additions. The result of the analysis shows that there are a total of 76 cases of errors found in the translated book. The most frequent error found is mistranslation of the words with 32 cases (error rate of 42%), and the second is mistranslation of the phrases or sentences with 22 cases (29%). The error of content omissions with 16 cases (21%) is the next and that of content additions with 6 cases (8%) is the least. One of the most important tasks of a translation is the accurate delivery of the source information and/or message in the most natural target language in accordance with the purpose of translation. Translators should do their best to meet the equivalence of translation. To reduce those errors and improve translation competence, English teachers and teaching pedagogy should be more interested in teaching vocabulary and proper reading comprehension skills based on precise grammatical knowledge.

Development of Theory of Mind in Preschoolers Who Grow up in Two Conflicting and Unbalanced Cultures,"Individuals rely on Theory of Mind (ToM) to represent themselves, others, and socio-cultural norms. Distinctive Western and Eastern developmental patterns of ToM have been reported in monocultural children. Relatively little is known about bicultural children, especially those children who grow up in two conflicting and unbalanced cultures. We hypothesized that thedevelopment of ToM in these bicultural preschoolers would follow the pattern of the dominant culture. To examine this hypothesis, we recruited English-speaking Chinese Singaporeanpreschoolers. In Study 1, we tested 3- to 5-year-olds (N = 120) with 5 ToM tasks, including diverse desires, diverse beliefs, knowledge access, and false belief, as well as a vocabulary task. In Study 2, we tested 5-year-olds (N = 30) with a picture-choice version of these ToM tasks. Both studies supported our hypothesis by revealing that the development of ToM in these bicultural children followed the pattern of the dominant culture. Additionally, we found that 5-year-old bicultural children are still developing false belief, and their verbal ability correlated with their ToM.     PU  - 한국아동학회",0
Receptive number morphosyntax in children with Down syndrome,"This study investigated the comprehension of plural morphosyntactic markers and its relationship with numerical comparison abilities in children with Down syndrome (DS). It evaluated 16 Spanish-speaking children with DS (mean verbal mental age = 3;6) and 16 typically developing children with similar receptive vocabulary (mean chronological age = 3;5). Children participated in two preferential looking tasks assessing their abilities to map singular and plural markers to their visual referents and to distinguish one object from more than one. Results showed that both groups of children correctly mapped plural markers to their referents but failed to map singular ones. Furthermore, results also indicated that both groups also looked at collections of more than one object with four objects but not at those with two. The eye movement patterns of children who looked at collections of more than one object suggest a counting-like strategy. These results indicate that comprehension of plural markers of children with DS is similar to that of their typically developing peers; however, it is not related to their numerical abilities.

Uncovering productive morphosyntax in French-learning toddlers: a multidimensional methodology perspective,"The present study applies a multidimensional methodological approach to the study of the acquisition of morphosyntax. It focuses on evaluating the degree of productivity of an infrequent subject-verb agreement pattern in the early acquisition of French and considers the explanatory role played by factors such as input frequency, semantic transparency of the agreement markers, and perceptual factors in accounting for comprehension of agreement in number (singular vs. plural) in an experimental setting. Results on a pointing task involving pseudo-verbs demonstrate significant comprehension of both singular and plural agreement in children aged 2;6. The experimental results are shown not to reflect input frequency, input marker reliability on its own, or lexically driven knowledge. We conclude that toddlers have knowledge of subject-verb agreement at age 2;6 which is abstract and productive despite its paucity in the input.

Schemas and competing paradigms in Swedish plural formation,"According to autonomous descriptions of Swedish morphology, for the majority of nouns the gender of the lexeme and the phonological nature of the last segment or segments of the base form (indefinite singular) determine the inflectional category of the noun. The Purpose of the present study is to find out if Swedish may resort to the use of larger shapes than the terminal segment or segments in the allegedly ambiguous monosyllabic CVC words. It has been shown in other languages-here giving English as an example-that items in semipro-ductive classes (like the English ablaut verbs string:strung and spin:spun) are associated via formal phonological links or bundles of links that constrain the manner in which native speakers pattern these form-to-form connections within morphological paradigms (see Bybee Slobin, 1982; Bybee, 1985). The present wug-type experiment with legal nonwords was administered to three groups of children, i.e., 8- to 9-year-olds, 10- to 11-year-olds, and 15-year-olds. It was hypothesized that the ambiguous monosyllabic CVC lexemes would stabilize themselves slowly and late during language acquisition. The results show a vowel and consonant effect in the en-gender CVC nonwords. Swedish thus resorts to the use of larger shapes (schema analogies) than the terminal segment or segments. Moreover, a development of paradigm membership toward adultlike patterns is seen at late stages of language acquisition of both the ambiguous and the unambiguous nonword types.

Modality effects in compounding with English inflectional morphology,"The treatment of plural morphemes in English noun-noun compounds is significant because it provides a test case for competing theories of language acquisition and representation. Even when the first noun in a compound refers to plural items, native speakers frequently use the singular form (Murphy, 2000). Sometimes, they will use the irregular plural form (mice chaser') but very rarely are regular plurals ('rats chaser') used as the first noun in a compound. This effect has been found with native English-speaking children (Gordon, 1985; Nicoladis, 2000; Oetting & Rice, 1993; van der Lely & Christian, 2000); native English-speaking teenagers (van der Lely & Christian, 2000); and native English-speaking adults (Lardiere & Schwartz, 1997; Murphy, 2000). The apparent dissociation between regular and irregular plurals (i.e. that irregular plurals are included before a second noun but regular plurals are almost never included before a second noun) is thought to be due to innate morphological constraints (Marcus, Brinkmann, Clahsen, Weise, & Pinker, 1995). Such constraints predict that all items of regular morphology should be treated differently from all items of irregular morphology by language users in all situations. However, if external factors such as input and response modality affect the number of plurals included in compounds, then this questions the internal constraint-based explanations of compounding and encourages investigation of how external factors might influence the number of plurals included in compounds.

On the Role of Phonetic Motivation and Frequency in the Acquisition of Alternations,"On the Role of Phonetic Motivation and Frequency in the Acquisition of AlternationsGerman nouns may alternate in two ways: a final word-final voiceless obstruent in the singular may correspond to a voiced one in the plural and a back vowel in the singular may correspond to a front one in the plural. We investigate the role of phonetic motivation and frequency in the acquisition of these alternations. The voicing alternation has a phonetic motivation, but the vowel alternation does not. On the basis of two corpus studies, we conclude that both alternations occur with equal frequency in the ambient language. In two production experiments, one with 5-year-olds and one with adults, we asked both populations to form plurals for given singular words and nonces. The children produce more voicing alternations in nonces than adults and fewer vowel alternations than adults. We conclude that children rely more on phonetic motivation than adults.

"[""Vernacular Study－Paul Serruys’s folklore research in China－"", ""‘토착’의 학문－세뤼(Paul Serruys, 1912~1999)의 중국민속학 연구－""]","For many years, the study of Chinese folklore by foreign scholars has been deeply interactive with the folklore of Chinese scholars. Therefore, it is necessary to define Chinese folklore as a science of Chinese folkway’s study. In the modern Chinese Folklore Movement, Paul Serruys, who lived in north China from 1936 to 1949, was such an important Chinese folklorist. As a missionary, he regarded academic research as a kind of worship to God and pursued the scientific nature of academic research. In the vernacular investigation of the rural area in the south of Datong City, oral riddles, children’s songs, folk stories and so on being increasingly important to him, and he carried out in-depth research on many folk matters in dozens of villages along the Sanggan river. In accordance with the basic law that human language acquisition starts from sound, his studies on local marriage customs, riddles, children’s songs and stories not only attached importance to dialects, but also marked the international phonetic symbols of local sounds one by one, made grammatical annotations, and then translated them into English or French for comparison and interpretation. He not only saw the difference between children’s riddles and adult’s riddles, children’s stories and adult’s stories, but also gained insight into the mutual influence and intertextuality of these genres. He saw not only the necessity and contingency of the rhymes like nicknames in the children, but also the association between the rhyme stories and children’s stories. The strong dialect color of his folklore makes it reasonable to regard it as “local accent folklore” or “vernacular study” as mentioned by Kunio Yanagita. Not only that, Paul Serruys’s studies also prompts us to reflect on what folklore is, and helps us to confront the folklore of Intangible Cultural Heritage in East Asian which are obviously full of anxiety but also like “distinguished discipline”.

Ancestral language acquisition - Implications for aspects of ethnic identity among Armenian American children and adolescents,"This article investigates associations between the acquisition of an ancestral language and ethnic affinity Narratives about Armenian and non-Armenian cultural activities and attitudes toward language usage and culture were elicited from 44 boys and girls aged 8-15 years. Some of the children spoke Armenian, in addition to English but all were active in an Armenian American community. American-born bilingual children were found to use relatively more first person plural pronouns than singular pronouns in stories about Armenian cultural activities compared with English-only speaking children of Armenian descent and foreign-born bilingual children, suggesting that American-born bilingual children may have closer affinity with the Armenian American community than either monolingual or foreign-born bilingual children. Differences between the groups in attitude toward bicultural background also were found. Monolinguals made relatively fewer positive evaluations of their bicultural experiences than either the American-born or foreign-born bilingual children.

"[""Cross-cultural Re-reading of Charles Dickens: Adaptation and Appropriation for the General Public"", ""찰스 디킨스 이문화적 다시 읽기: 대중을 위한 변용과 전용""]","This paper addresses the public’s accessibility to and popularity of A Christmas Carol and A Tale of Two Cities in Korea from the perspectives of retelling and rewriting, respectively. Since their first introduction to Korea in the 1940s, A Carol has become a steady seller mainly targeting children and the youth while A Tale has recently picked up its sales due to a Broadway musical of the same title and a Hollywood film, Dark Knight Rises in 2012. This research examines why and how the two English novels reach out toward Korean readers in certain ways. The demand for English literature classics rises not simply for storybooks in Korea. Rather, they serve study resources for Korean essay writing with logical reasoning to help students prepare for college entrance exams and general English language acquisition. Amid this backdrop, innumerable Korean versions of A Carol, abridged and retold, have been published with the unparalleled popularity over A Tale. Meanwhile, as part of celebrating the Dickens bi-centenary in 2012, the walking event, “Dickens in Seoul” took place with a theme of Korea’s two cities inspired by A Tale, and the nine Korean participants in the event rewrote Dickens’ stories as homage to the English writer in Hello, Mr. Dickens. The present paper explores Dickens’ traces in the five rewritten texts in the Korean collection which adapted and appropriated A Tale with each writer’s own creativity.

Finding one's meaning: A test of the relation between quantifiers and integers in language development,"We explored children's early interpretation of numerals and linguistic number marking, in order to test the hypothesis (e.g., Carey (2004). Bootstrapping and the origin of concepts. Daedalus. 59-68) that children's initial distinction between one and other numerals (i.e., two, three, etc.) is bootstrapped from a prior distinction between singular and plural nouns. Previous studies have presented evidence that in languages Without singular-plural morphology, like Japanese and Chinese, children acquire the meaning of the word one later than in singular-plural languages like English and Russian. In two experiments, we sought to corroborate this relation between grammatical number and integer acquisition within English. We found a significant correlation between children's comprehension of numerals and a large set of natural language quantifiers and determiners, even when controlling for effects due to age. However, we also found that 2-year-old children, who are just acquiring singular-plural morphology and the word one, fail to assign an exact interpretation to singular noun phrases (e.g., a banana), despite interpreting one as exact. For example, in a Truth-value judgment task, most children judged that a banana was consistent with a set of two objects, despite rejecting sets of two for the numeral one. Also, children who gave exactly one object for singular nouns did not have a better comprehension of numerals relative to children who did not give exactly one. Thus, we conclude that the correlation between quantifier comprehension and numeral comprehension in children of this age is not attributable to the singular-plural distinction facilitating the acquisition of the word one. We argue that quantifiers play a more general role in highlighting the semantic function of numerals, and that children distinguish between numerals and other quantifiers from the beginning, assigning exact interpretations only to numerals.

"A Centennial of Los cuentos de mi tia Panchita (Tales of My Aunt Panchita), by Carmen Lyra (1920 - 2020): The Educational, Literary and Political Context of the First Edition","The year 2020 commemorates one-hundred years since the Costa Rican classic, Los cuentos de mi tia Panchita (Tales of my Aunt Panchita), by Carmen Lyra and edited by Joaquin Garcia Monge, was first published. This article sets forth some of the educational, literary and political circumstances that led to the publication of a singular literary work for children that compiled Costa Rica 's most celebrated folk tales. Emphasis is made on folklore and the importance of its publication in the children's periodical, San Selerin, which led to the establishment of a Children's Literature Department at the Costa Rican Teachers College and also looks at the role of the author in the different social movements that led to the fall of the Tinoco brothers' dictatorship. The collection of stories recreates arguments previously contributed by authors Fernan Caballero from Spain and Joel Chandler Harris from the United States. Other sources are also studied, such as a compilation of popular Spanish Folk and Fairly Tales by Antonio Rodriguez Almodovar. Even now, in the 21 century, Los cuentos de mi tia Panchita may be deemed to be politically incorrect, given its use of grammatical construction and vocabulary of conservative individuals that may be considered inappropriate for children. Yet, it is a literary work that reflects the eagerness of the author and editor to disseminate popular culture and represent their avant-garde positions.

Comparing different models of the development of the English verb category,"In this study data from the first six months of 12 children's multiword speech were used to test the validity of Valian's (1991) syntactic performance-limitation account and Tomasello's (1992) verb-island account of early multiword speech with particular reference to the development of the English verb category. The results provide evidence for appropriate use of verb morphology, auxiliary verb structures, pronoun case marking, and SVO word order from quite early in development. However, they also demonstrate a great deal of lexical specificity in the children's use of these systems, evidenced by a lack of overlap in the verbs to which different morphological markers were applied, a lack of overlap in the verbs with which different auxiliary verbs were used, a disproportionate use of the first person singular nominative pronoun I, and a lack of overlap in the lexical items that served as the subjects and direct objects of transitive verbs. These findings raise problems for both a syntactic performance-limitation account and a strong verb-island account of the data and suggest the need to develop a move general lexicalist account of early multiword speech that explains why some words come to function as ""islands"" of organization in the child's grammar and others do not.

Negative sentences in children with specific language impairment,"This study used elicited production methodology to investigate the negative sentences that are produced by English-speaking children with specific language impairment (SLI). Negative sentences were elicited in contexts in which adults use the negative auxiliary verb doesn't (e.g., It doesn't fit). This form was targeted to see how negative markers ( not, n't) interact with the 3rd person singular -s in the grammars of children with SLI. A robust sample of negative sentences was collected from 63 children: 21 5-year-old children with SLI, 21 language-matched typically-developing children and 21 age-matched typically-developing children. The negative sentences produced by children in the two control groups were consistently adult-like. In contrast, only 5 of the 21 children in the SLI group produced adult-like negative sentences with doesn't. The other 16 children with SLI produced a variety of non-adult negative sentences (e.g., It not fit, It's not fit, It not fits, It's not fits). The study concludes that children with SLI undergo an extended period in the development of sentential negation during which they produce a range of non-adult sentences that are similar to those previously reported in younger 2- to 3-year-old typically-developing children.

"The Ecology of Mobile Phone Use in Wesbank, South Africa","Although education is intuitively understood as located in the institutional realm of schools and adjacent formal learning environments, it is good to remind ourselves of the fact that such formal learning environments are surrounded by complex informal learning environments, and that learning and teaching, if you wish, are features of an enormous range of everyday social practices performed individually as well as in small peer groups and (increasingly) in large virtual networks. In addition, the boundaries between formal and informal learning environments are leaky, and skills and knowledge acquired in each of them percolate into the other (remember Ben Rampton's (2006) accounts of how popular music entered urban UK classrooms, and how school knowledge of German entered the playful interaction of adolescent learners). New technologies - Internet and mobile communication devices - have complicated and intensified the development of such informal learning environments and have shaped a space for new, informally developed, patterns of literacy and numeracy. While such patterns bear similarities with formally acquired patterns of literacy and numeracy, they nevertheless are new and extraordinarily complex (see e. g. Kress (2003) and Lankshear & Knobel (2011); Davidson & Goldberg (2010) address the wider implications).In environments where access to formal learning environments is or has been constrained, such new technologies often grow into prominence as tools and gateways to the acquisition of skills and forms of knowledge otherwise not available. This is the case with the only new technology that has been more or less democratically spread over the world, and this chapter will engage with the ways in which mobile phones have acquired such prominence in a particular space: a township near Cape Town, South Africa. We will show how mobile phones have become a 'placed resource' there - a resource that has acquired specific functions by virtue of its 'ecological' insertion into broader local economies of knowledge and resources (Blommaert, 2003: 619). New resources such as mobile phones do not operate in a vacuum and do not improve or deteriorate the local conditions of life per se. They do so in relation to what is already there in the way of resources, and their effects depend strongly on their 'degree of fit' into local repertoires and modes of communication (Hymes, 1966: 119). This chapter is, thus, an attempt towards situating the use of mobile phones as learning devices in the broader local communicative, social and cultural framework - an elementary ethnographic endeavour.

Acquiring the Last Plural: Morphophonological Effects on the Comprehension of /-z/,"English-speaking children use plural morphology from around the age of 2, yet often omit the syllabic plural allomorph /-z/ until age 5 (e.g., bus(es)). It is not clear if this protracted acquisition is due to articulatory difficulties, low input frequency, or fricative-final words (e.g., bus, nose) being treated as already plural, raising questions about when and how the representation of the syllabic plural develops in perception. Novel-word intermodal preferential looking studies have shown productive comprehension of the plural allomorph /-s/ (e.g., cats) at 24 months. Using the same procedure, this study investigated when toddlers can comprehend the syllabic plural, and treat words ending in /s, z/ as singular (e.g., bus vs. bus+es). The results show that 30-month-olds (n = 20) could not identify the number condition of either the singular or plural, but 36-month-olds (n = 20) could identify both, showing productive knowledge of the syllabic allomorph and its singular counterpart with novel words. This suggests children's omission of the syllabic plural in production may be due to later acquired mental representations requiring a sophisticated understanding of English morphophonology.

Converging Evidence of Underlying Competence: Comprehension and Production in the Acquisition of Spanish Subject-Verb Agreement.,"A surprising comprehension-production asymmetry in subject-verb (SV) agreement acquisition has been suggested in the literature, and recent research indicates that task-specific as well as language-specific features may contribute to this apparent asymmetry across languages. The present study investigates when during development children acquiring Mexican Spanish gain competence with 3rd-person SV agreement, testing production as well as comprehension in the same children aged between 3;6 and 5;7 years, and whether comprehension of SV agreement is modulated by the sentential position of the verb (i.e., medial vs. final position). Accuracy and sensitivity analyses show that comprehension performance correlates with SV agreement production abilities, and that comprehension of singular and plural third-person forms is not influenced by the sentential position of the agreement morpheme. Issues of the appropriate outcome measure and the role of structural familiarity in the development of abstract representations are discussed.",0

BABIES USING IPAD APPS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE-LEARNING ENVIRONMENT,"The term App is a short way to name the ""application"" in singular and plural. The following paper based upon a teachers log, summarizes some of the most important experiences a group of teachers faced previous, during and while using iPad applications to stimulate kids, from 45 days to 4 years old. Based on a timeline we introduce both the enthusiastic experience and the scientific perspective, only with the objectivity and the theoretical frame to support the paper, but in a storytelling way, to take the readers with us in a journey that helps them visualize the experience, closer to the feelings but not so far from the objectivity of the science. From Apps designed to provide infants with essential stimulation during early stages of development to Apps that help teachers to facilitate the reading and writing process at the time they enjoy and explore the technology in a friendly and natural way. As a result of our research project, we found that some apps are based on decades of research and beautifully designed, they were planned to provide as much stimulation as possible, some of them use bold, high-contrast symbols, shapes, patterns, and captivating sounds, proven to be preferred by infants. We decided to use apps as teaching aids and we chose those with a higher level of stimulation in the areas of cognitive and motor development, but with impressive potential to provide with significant visual tracking, scanning, and object permanence, the aim was considered in two main ways, using English as a communication channel and technology that speeds myelination of brain cells. On the other hand, the term 'early intervention' designates educational and neuro-protection strategies aimed at enhancing brain development. Using technology as one of these strategies increases both the teaching experience for the teachers in charge of the early stimulation, as well as the learning experience for babies. Early educational strategies seek to take advantage of cerebral plasticity, according to the experts, from the born day to the age of seven, represent the most adequate and important period to generate as much neuro-connections as possible. In our experience we have observed that kids respond naturally and friendly to the chosen apps as teaching aids to present vocabulary, to practice hand writing, to read stories and to have fun at the time they practice math, sciences and other skills. Early stimulation programs were first devised in the United States for vulnerable children in low-income families; positive effects were recorded regarding school failure rates and social problems. In the language learning area, we decided to put in practice a stimulation program in the University of Colima's Baby Day Care Department BDCD (Estancias Infantiles in Spanish). The institution attends the kids of every woman that works for the University. It is organized in rooms that keep the kids in periods of 6 months, the first three years and twelve months for the last year they spend at the BDCD. The class took place two days a week for each room in sessions of 30 minutes a day. The results so far shows positive results, from the day we began to now we had a great amount of significant experiences we would like to share in a full paper, as well as in the presentation.

I'm are what I'm are: The acquisition of first-person singular present BE,"The present study investigates the development of am in the speech of one English-speaking child, Scarlett (aged 4;6-5;6). We show that am is infrequent in the speech addressed to children; the acquisition of this form of BE presents a unique insight into the processes underlying language development because children have little evidence regarding its correct use. Scarlett produced a pervasive error where she overextended are to first-person singular contexts where am was required (e.g., I'm are trying, When are I'm finished?). Am gradually emerged in her speech on what appears to be a construction-specific basis. The findings of the study are used in support of a usage-based, constructivisit approach to language development.

Usage-based account of the acquisition of liaison: Evidence from sensitivity to the singular/plural orientation of nouns,"This study investigates whether children's production and recognition of obligatory liaison sequences in French depend on the singular/plural orientation of nouns. Certain nouns occur more frequently in the plural (e.g., arbre ""tree""), whereas others are found more often in the singular (e.g., arc-en-ciel ""rainbow""). In the input, children more frequently encounter these plural-oriented nouns after determiners that indicate plurality (e.g., les, des ""the"", deux ""two"") and that are often associated with a /z/ liaison (e.g., deux arbres [dozarbr] ""two trees""). In Experiment 1, 122 children (3 years 2 months to 6 years 3 months of age) were asked to produce nominal phrases with either /z/ liaisons (i.e., in plural contexts such as deux ours [dozarbr] ""two bears"") or /n/ liaisons (i.e., in singular contexts such as un ours [oenurs] ""one bear""). We found correlations between the plural orientation of the nouns and (a) the probability that they will be preceded by an incorrect /z/ liaison in the singular context and (b) the probability that they will be preceded by a correct /z/ liaison in the plural context. This result was, however. restricted to the younger children. In Experiment 2, 20 children (5 years 5 months to 6 years 3 months of age) were asked to monitor target words in auditorily presented sentences. The results showed shorter reaction times for singular-oriented nouns when preceded by a singular determiner than when preceded by a plural determiner. Conversely, plural-oriented nouns were responded to faster when preceded by a plural determiner than when preceded by a singular determiner. Results are discussed within the framework of a two-stage model of liaison acquisition recently proposed by Chevrot, Chabanal, and Dugua (Journal of French Language Studies, 17 [2007]103-128) as well as by Chevrot, Dugua, and Fayol (Journal of Child Language [in press]).

A connectionist model of the Arabic plural system,"Connectionist accounts of inflectional morphology have focused on the domain of the English past tense in which the default process (add/ed/) reflects the process of suffixation adopted by the majority of forms in the language. Connectionist models exploit the imbalance between English regular and irregular verbs when learning the past tense and when responding to novel forms in a default fashion. Not all inflectional systems have a default which is characterised by a majority of forms in the language. The Arabic plural system has been cited as one such system where a minority default process operates-the ""sound"" plural in Arabic applies to only a minority of the forms in the lexicon, yet it appears to adopt the role of a default for novel nouns. We contrast two types of default process that might lead to this behaviour, a symbolic default and a distributional default. We provide a detailed analysis of the phonological similarity structure of the Arabic plural system and conclude that it is unlikely the distribution of singular Arabic nouns can support a distributional default for the sound plural. Nevertheless, classification networks and pattern association networks perform surprisingly well at the task of learning the Arabic plural and generalising to unseen Arabic nouns. In fact, the performance of a neural network classifier exceeds the performance of a symbolic hybrid ""rule-associative"" model even when the latter is optimised for correct classification. We conclude that the default rule is redundant, since generalisation to novel forms is more accurately predicted by the similarity structure in the phonological space of Arabic nouns alone. Finally, we present a set of empirical predictions for children's; acquisition of the Arabic plural system, derived from the network simulations.

Piecing together numerical language: children's use of default units in early counting and quantification,"When asked to 'find three forks', adult speakers of English use the noun 'fork' to identify units for counting. However, when number words (e.g. three) and quantifiers (e.g. more, every) are used with unfamiliar words ('Give me three blickets') noun-specific conceptual criteria are unavailable for picking out units. This poses a problem for young children learning language, who begin to use quantifiers and number words by age 2, despite knowing a relatively small number of nouns. Without knowing how individual nouns pick out units of quantification - e.g. what counts as a blicket- how could children decide whether there are three blickets or four? Three experiments suggest that children might solve this problem by assigning 'default units' of quantification to number words, quantifiers, and number morphology. When shown objects that are broken into arbitrary pieces, 4-year-olds in Experiment 1 treated pieces as units when counting, interpreting quantifiers, and when using singular-plural morphology. Experiment 2 found that although children treat object-hood as sufficient for quantification, it is not necessary. Also sufficient for individuation are the criteria provided by known nouns. When two nameable things were glued together (e.g. two cups), children counted the glued things as two. However, when two arbitrary pieces of an object were put together (e.g. two parts of a ball), children counted them as one, even if they had previously counted the pieces as two. Experiment 3 found that when the pieces of broken things were nameable (e.g. wheels of a bicycle), 4-year-olds did not include them in counts of whole objects (e.g. bicycles). We discuss the role of default units in early language acquisition, their origin in acquisition, and how children eventually acquire an adult semantics identifying units of quantification.

"Data_Sheet_1_Definiteness and Maximality in French Language Acquisition, More Adult-Like Than You Would Expect.docx","This study considers the mastery of maximality, or domain restrictions, in a group of 47 children acquiring French (aged 4.06-8.09), as well as a control group of young adults. Singular definite (le the) and indefinite (un a/one) plural (des some, les the) and explicitly maximal contexts (tous les all the) were provided to participants. Animals were arranged in groups of three. Participants were asked to select one or more animals from these groups and give them to the experimenter (similar to Munn et al., 2006). Following Munn, we expected children to make maximality errors on the singular definite items. However, we did not observe this pattern. On the contrary we observed more errors on plurals generally. Further, the developmental patterns show that participants become less maximal in their responses to indefinite plurals (an adult-like pattern, also found in Caponigro et al., 2012) with no important changes on definite types: no strong age effects are observed on maximality patterns. These point to the importance of cross-linguistic data for the understanding of child language acquisition and error patterns in psycholinguistic theory. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",0
Current Concepts in Arm Care Exercise Programs and Injury Risk Reduction in Adolescent Baseball Players: A Clinical Review,"Context: Awareness of important injury risk factors associated with excessive pitching volume has been highlighted in the literature, but injury rates remain high. Shoulder pain in baseball players is associated with various changes in musculoskeletal movements, which presents as measurable impairments throughout the kinetic chain. Baseball coaches and rehabilitation professionals have utilized exercise programs targeting strength and flexibility of the throwing arm to prevent injuries. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of arm care exercise programs in reducing upper extremity injury rates in adolescent baseball players.Evidence Acquisition: A search of electronic databases, including CINAHL with full text, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus was conducted to retrieve available articles in English from the years 2010 through 2020. The search terms injury prevention, exercise, and adolescent baseball were used.Study Design: Clinical review.Level of Evidence: Level 4.Results: Improving shoulder internal rotation range of motion by stretching the posterior shoulder muscles daily was associated with a 36% risk reduction of shoulder and elbow injuries. Group-based arm care exercise programs that target multiple musculoskeletal impairments demonstrated an approximately 50% reduced risk of elbow injury.Conclusion: For adolescent baseball players, arm care injury prevention programs focusing on important musculoskeletal impairments are effective at reducing injury incidence rates. Multimodal injury prevention programs that improve multiple musculoskeletal impairments are more comprehensive and may result in better injury reduction than programs focusing on a singular impairment.

Effect of Using Vocal Songs and Music Towards Development of Disadvantaged Children,"The research objectives were to study the effect of applying songs and music to disadvantaged children's development and to use the research findings to guide in the development of a musical activity pattern for children's development. Twenty disadvantaged children were chosen as a representative sample from a foster home. They joined the music activity for 16 times for a duration of 1 hour and 30 minutes for each session. The research tools included a mental health test certified by the Department of Mental Health, an activity handbook used to develop the intellectual ability and emotional expression for children which was certified by the Ministry of Public Health, the Department of Medical Services and Health, a means observation method of the development level, an evaluation form of the effect of applying songs and music to disadvantaged children's development and a music activity plan certified by an expert for an evaluation and reliability rating. The research revealed that the songs and music helped the physical development because the children danced while the songs and music played. The effect of slow rhythm songs and music helped the emotional and mental development of the children who felt more relaxed, calmer, and focused. The effect of fast rhythm songs and music made the children cheerful and joyful. Joining the activity in a group with others helped in the social development enabling the children to acclimate to others. Songs concerning counting numbers and notes helped the mathematical development. Songs concerning nature helped the scientific development. Songs with both Thai and English vocabularies and rhythmic songs helped the linguistic development. The children who listened to songs and then composed their own dance steps and moves was considered helping the creative development. In conclusion, the mean observation method of development level was analyzed with a software used to find a mean.

Gerard Manley Hopkins Collection,"Gerard Manley Hopkins was born in 1844 in Stratford, Essex, near London as the first of nine children of Manley and Catherine ""Kate"" (Smith) Hopkins. His father founded a marine insurance firm and was also a published poet, and his mother, who was the well-educated daughter of a London physician, was fond of music and reading. Both the Hopkins and Smith families included artists, and Gerard displayed the family skill in the detailed sketches that he made throughout his life. Hopkins attended Cholmondeley Grammar School at Highgate from 1854 to 1863. His earliest extant poem, ""The Escorial,"" dates from this period and won Hopkins the school's poetry prize. From 1863 to 1867, he studied classics at Balliol College, Oxford University, taking first-class degrees in both Classics and ""Greats."" During college, Hopkins befriended Robert Bridges, the later English poet laureate, who was important both to Hopkins's development as a poet and his later posthumous acclaim. In 1866, he converted to Catholicism, greatly shocking his High Church Anglican family. Hopkins studied theology at St. Beuno's College in Wales from 1874 to 1877. The Welsh language and its poetry inspired him and led to his poetical innovations and techniques such as ""sprung rhythm."" After his ordination in 1877, Hopkins served variously as a missioner, preacher, and parish priest in Oxford and London, and in the manufacturing cities of Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow. He also taught Latin and Greek at Stonyhurst College, Lancaster, and at University College, Dublin. His years in Ireland, marked by overwork and poor health, provoked a series of poems known as the ""terrible sonnets,"" reflecting his melancholy dejection. He died of typhoid on June 8, 1889, in Dublin. Because Hopkins put his responsibilities as a priest before his poetry, his literary output was slim; apart from a few poems, he was not published during his own lifetime. However his experiments in prosody (especially sprung rhythm), his concept of inscape, and his use of imagery established him as a daring innovator amongst his fellow Victorian poets, one whom poet and critic John Crowe Ransom called the first modern poet. The Gerard Manley Hopkins collection includes manuscripts, letters, and drawings. Hopkins's poetry manuscripts include ""In the Valley of the Elwy,"" ""The Loss of the Eurydice,"" ""The Sacrifice,"" and ""Spring."" Hopkins's notations for spoken performance appear on both ""In the Valley of the Elwy"" and ""Spring."" Page proofs for the first printed volume of Hopkins's poemspublished posthumously in 1918 under the editorship of English poet laureate Robert Bridgesare also present. The manuscript works are augmented by a variety of pencil sketches that demonstrate the familial artistic bent and Hopkins's skill as a draftsman. The drawings date as early as 1854 when Hopkins was ten years old and convey his observations of nature through small, yet minutely detailed, sketches of animals, plants, trees, and pastoral settings. The collection also contains letters written by Hopkins to the Irish poet and novelist Katharine Tynan, his brother Everard Hopkins, his sister Grace Hopkins, and his father Manley Hopkins. Additional letters and drawings are by members of the Hopkins family. Of special interest is a keepsake piece of unused Honiton lace worked for Queen Victoria's wedding dress in 1839 that was given to one of Hopkins's aunts. This collection was digitized as part of Project REVEAL (Read and View English & American Literature).",0

"International Centre for Language and Communicative Development: How the Input Shapes the Acquisition of Verb Morphology: Elicited Production and Computational Modelling in Two Highly Inflected Languages, 2014-2020","The aim of the present work was to develop a computational model of how children acquire inflectional morphology for marking person and number; one of the central challenges in language development. First, in order to establish which putative learning phenomena are sufficiently robust to constitute a target for modelling, we ran large-scale elicited production studies with native learners of Finnish (N = 77; 35-63 months) and Polish (N = 81; 35-59 months), using a novel method that, unlike previous studies, allows for elicitation of all six person/number forms in the paradigm (first, second and third person; singular and plural). We then proceeded to build and test a connectionist model of the acquisition of person/number marking which not only acquires near adult-like mastery of the system (including generalisation to unseen items), but also yields all of the key phenomena observed in the elicited-production studies; specifically, effects of token frequency and phonological neighbourhood density of the target form, and a pattern whereby errors generally reflect the replacement of low frequency targets by higher-frequency forms of the same verb, or forms with the same person/number as the target, but with a suffix from an inappropriate conjugation class. The findings demonstrate that acquisition of even highly complex systems of inflectional morphology can be accounted for by a theoretical model that assumes rote storage and phonological analogy, as opposed to formal symbolic rules.The International Centre for Language and Communicative Development (LuCiD) will bring about a transformation in our understanding of how children learn to communicate, and deliver the crucial information needed to design effective interventions in child healthcare, communicative development and early years education. Learning to use language to communicate is hugely important for society. Failure to develop language and communication skills at the right age is a major predictor of educational and social inequality in later life. To tackle this problem, we need to know the answers to a number of questions: How do children learn language from what they see and hear? What do measures of children's brain activity tell us about what they know? and How do differences between children and differences in their environments affect how children learn to talk? Answering these questions is a major challenge for researchers. LuCiD will bring together researchers from a wide range of different backgrounds to address this challenge. The LuCiD Centre will be based in the North West of England and will coordinate five streams of research in the UK and abroad. It will use multiple methods to address central issues, create new technology products, and communicate evidence-based information directly to other researchers and to parents, practitioners and policy-makers. LuCiD's RESEARCH AGENDA will address four key questions in language and communicative development: 1) ENVIRONMENT: How do children combine the different kinds of information that they see and hear to learn language? 2) KNOWLEDGE: How do children learn the word meanings and grammatical categories of their language? 3) COMMUNICATION: How do children learn to use their language to communicate effectively? 4) VARIATION: How do children learn languages with different structures and in different cultural environments? The fifth stream, the LANGUAGE 0-5 PROJECT, will connect the other four streams. It will follow 80 English learning children from 6 months to 5 years, studying how and why some children's language development is different from others. A key feature of this project is that the children will take part in studies within the other four streams. This will enable us to build a complete picture of language development from the very beginning through to school readiness. Applying different methods to study children's language development will constrain the types of explanations that can be proposed, helping us create much more accurate theories of language development. We will observe and record children in natural interaction as well as studying their language in more controlled experiments, using behavioural measures and correlations with brain activity (EEG). Transcripts of children's language and interaction will be analysed and used to model how these two are related using powerful computer algorithms. LuciD's TECHNOLOGY AGENDA will develop new multi-method approaches and create new technology products for researchers, healthcare and education professionals. We will build a 'big data' management and sharing system to make all our data freely available; create a toolkit of software (LANGUAGE RESEARCHER'S TOOLKIT) so that researchers can analyse speech more easily and more accurately; and develop a smartphone app (the BABYTALK APP) that will allow parents, researchers and practitioners to monitor, assess and promote children's language development. With the help of six IMPACT CHAMPIONS, LuCiD's COMMUNICATIONS AGENDA will ensure that parents know how they can best help their children learn to talk, and give healthcare and education professionals and policy-makers the information they need to create intervention programmes that are firmly rooted in the latest research findings.

"How to Make Music in an Epidemic: Hearing AIDS, 1981-1996","In 2011, AIDS turned thirty. In three decades, millions of men, women, and children around the world have lost their lives to the ravages of the disease. But the story of AIDS is more than a body count. The epidemic has ushered in new vocabularies in law, politics, science, and medicine and created new areas of expertise. It has engendered new identities: the person living with AIDS, the person who is HIV-positive, and the person who is HIV-negative. The health crisis invigorated forms of social and political activism and led to novel rituals for living, being sick, being healthy, and dying. AIDS also generated new expressive modalities in media, visual, and performing arts.How to Make Music in an Epidemic: Hearing AIDS, 1981-1996 participates in the construction of the history of AIDS in the arts by looking at a virtually untold story: musical engagements with and responses to HIV/AIDS. I limit the scope of this project to the music I know and love best: English-language popular song and music video. The study is further limited to works written, produced, or released during the first fifteen years of the US AIDS epidemic, that is, from 1981-1996. As other scholars have noted, the introduction of effective treatments in the late-1990s signaled a shift not only in the medical realities but also the discursive construction of the epidemic.       Working in virtually very genre and style, songwriters, composers, performers, and music video directors used their art to craft narratives and ideologies about AIDS, to inspire forms of activism, to memorialize the dead, and to educate listeners. To make sense of this varied musical terrain in Part One, I outline five categories of songs about AIDS: songs by people with AIDS, songs about personal relationships, songs about social changes, pedagogical or didactic songs, and extant songs given a new meaning in the context of the epidemic.Song lyrics are important repositories of meaning, particular for songs about AIDS. Accordingly, I provide close readings of many examples in addition to analysis of their musical content and associated music videos. The focus on lyrics invites comparison of works from radically different genres and reveals common representational strategies, most notably a tendency for such songs to avoid mentioning HIV/AIDS directly. This project also listens to what audiences, fans, and artists themselves had to say about works that address AIDS. Using an interdisciplinary framework that draws from music studies, feminist theory, queer theory, trauma studies, and media studies, I further contextualize these songs within broader traditions of music and arts activism in the age of AIDS.  In Part Two, I offer the first musical biography of singer, songwriter, author, and AIDS activist Michael Callen (1955-1993). Callen lived through an extraordinary moment in gay history. He moved from the Midwest to the East Coast at the moment that Gay Liberation dovetailed with the start of the AIDS epidemic. Callens keen mind, sharp wit, and commitment to social justice for gay men, lesbians, people of color, and people with AIDS took him to the forefront of national AIDS politics. At the same time, his work as a musician occurred within a predominately gay niche, which allowed him a degree of expressive freedom unavailable to many of the mainstream artists in Part One. Callens songs, albums, and performances document the experiences of his generation. Using previously unavailable archival materials, new interviews with friends and family, and analysis of his commercially available recordings as a solo artist and with The Flirtations, I provide a portrait of the ways this activist, songwriter, and performer made music in an epidemic.

?Ils n?en font ni m?tier ni marchandise?: imprimerie et commerce du livre scolaire chez les Fr?res des ?coles chr?tiennes en France au 18(e) si?cle,"?They made neither a profession nor a commodity out of them?: printing, schoolbook trading and the Brothers of the Christian Schools in eighteenth-century France From the seventeenth century onwards, there was an increase in the number of teaching communities in France taking on the management of small charitable schools for working-class girls and boys. These communities set out in their regulations the way they wanted the classes to be run. They recommended the collective lesson method, which presupposed that all pupils who were at the same level should have the same book in their hands. This practical constraint meant that different ways of organising the provision of books to pupils emerged among these communities. One community, the Brothers of the Christian Schools, stands out in particular for its highly integrated book system, which was set up by their founder, Jean-Baptiste de La Salle. It included a common corpus for all schools, contracts with printers and direct sales to pupils. This particular aspect of the Lasallian community?s history is the focus of this article. The first section considers how both the educationists who served as models for La Salle and other contemporary communities dealt with the question of books. In the Ecole Paroissiale (1654), Jacques de Batencour described the collective lesson method but did not expand on the supply of books, which could be found in the bookshops of the parish of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet. The Ursulines, whose schools were rapidly increasing in number, did not specify a corpus of common textbooks for the whole community, but their regulations stipulated that each school must stock up on books for resale at cost price to pupils. In actual fact, they made a small profit (20?30% of the book price) to fund book donations for the poorest pupils. This operating model could be found in many female communities, such as the Vatelottes de Toul and the Sisters of Ernemont in Normandy. In Lyon, Charles D?mia (1637?1689) established a learning progression method based on the use of a small canon of books that he had part-written. He did not organise the provision of the books to the pupils, but the Office of Schools (Bureau des ?coles) entered into contracts with local printers to ensure a plentiful supply of the necessary books. However, as school monitoring visits showed, it was difficult to make the teachers and families use the books listed in the R?glemens pour les ?coles de la ville et dioc?se de Lyon (regulations for schools in the city and diocese of Lyon) (1688). The teachers continued to use whatever syllabaries and children?s devotional books their pupils brought in, such as the Heures de Notre-Dame. When La Salle founded the Brothers of the Christian Schools, he had been partly inspired by the Lyon schools model. However, he took this a step further, writing all the educational materials himself so that they corresponded with the dual catechetical and literacy mission of his foundation. This heritage did not fossilise the Brothers? pedagogical reflection during the eighteenth century. The Lasallian syllabary was contested very early on and was gradually replaced by a more classical form of syllabary combined with the common prayers. The collection of psalms used in the schools evolved in line with musical trends. Textbooks for grammar and arithmetic, which were produced in response to the needs of the urban middle classes, were added in the 1770s.La Salle combined his specification of this corpus with the commercial organisation that was lacking in the D?mia schools (but present, for example, in the Ursuline schools), whereby the Brothers sold the books that the children were to use. Drawing on local archives, the second section of this article examines the many objections generated by this ?school bookshop?. Booksellers were the main opponents of this system. They appealed against the unfair competition to the royal administration, since it was theoretically forbidden for non-booksellers to practise bookselling. There were also objections from schoolteachers, who tried to discredit the Brothers by accusing them not only of making a profit on the sale of school supplies but also of favouring children from the urban middle classes over the poor, who were the supposed focus of their mission. Finally, the families themselves opposed this system because they were unhappy about the forced purchases, which conflicted with the domestic recycling practices that prevailed where school supplies were concerned. The third section of this article highlights the major breakthrough that this community-run system for producing schoolbooks represented. Production was concentrated in the community?s three provincial capitals, namely Rouen and Avignon from the early eighteenth century onwards and Nancy from the 1770s onwards. In all three cases, the provincial capital was located in a centre that was very active in terms of publishing, thus facilitating a large-scale supply to the schools. This was not just a fortuitous coincidence, because the dynamics that drove the Christian schools were not unrelated to those that maintained the prosperity of the local printing houses. In these three ?letterpress capitals?, the Brothers entered into contracts with the printers, negotiated prices and acquired real expertise in printing matters. Schools located in and around these cities could be easily equipped with the corpus of books specified by their founder. For schools further afield, it is possible that the corpus was adapted according to the titles available from local printers and booksellers, as shown for the schools in Reims, Montauban and Grenoble. Although Lasallian pedagogical practice did not always adhere fully to the plan set out by its founder and while the children did not always work through the entire corpus of La Salle?s books, his schools nevertheless became the models to be followed and imitated in the closing decades of the century. With their printing presses and their bookselling teachers, the Brothers? schools thus marked a considerable milestone in the slow diffusion of the simultaneous method of teaching in small French schools right up to the nineteenth century.

La Música en Educación Infantil: análisis comparativo de los currículos autonómicos de España,Abstract The transfer of the Spanish State to the Autonomous Communities with full competences in education during the last two decades of the 20th century currently allows two different levels to be found where official curricula are developed: the national and the autonomous ones.     The purpose of this study is to establish the differences and similarities between the music content present in the curricula of the different Spanish autonomous communities and the Royal Decrees published that contain the minimum teachings for the second cycle of Early Childhood Education for the Spanish national framework in two different legislative context: LOGSE and LOE.     With its own methodological design within the field of Comparative Education and using the CARMEN questionnaire based on the comparative analysis of curricular elements as the main research instrument.     Educational curricula are not used in Spain as an ideological tool at the service of the ideals of one political party or another as regards Music Education in the Early Childhood Education.,0
Editorial,"The content of the papers differs, and they comprise topics from students understanding of pictures in books, how sustainable development goals are integrated into the home economics context, how to evaluate students environmental worldviews and concerns, what the relationship between the factors and conditions of the autonomy of pre-school teachers is and how they foster the autonomy of pre-school children, what language teachers discriminatory practices against students are, to music education with a paper about rhyming in the context of the phonological awareness of pre-school children.     The purpose of the fourth paper, by Tatjana Devjak, Irena Janžekovič Žmauc, and Jože Benčina, entitled The Relationship between the Factors and Conditions of the Autonomy of Preschool Teachers and Fostering the Autonomy of Preschool Children in Kindergarten, argues that fostering the autonomy of children in kindergarten contributes to the positive effects of the individual's autonomy later in life.     The next paper, entitled A Classroom Survey of Language Teachers' Discriminatory Practices against Students: Causes, Consequences and Keys, by Seyyed Hatam Tamimi Sad, and Olga Quiñónez Eames, aimed at revealing the incidence of discrimination toward English as a Foreign Language students, the grounds on which it happens, its adverse effects on students as well as potential solutions to it.",0
Hand-clapping to the rhythm of newly learned words improves L2 pronunciation: Evidence from training Chinese adolescents with French words,"Though research has shown that rhythmic training is beneficial for phonological speech processing, little empirical work has been carried out to assess whether rhythmic training in the classroom can help to improve pronunciation in a second language. This study tests the potential benefits of hand-clapping to the rhythm of newly learned French words for the acquisition of pronunciation patterns by Chinese adolescents. In a between-subjects training experiment with a pretest/posttest design, 50 Chinese adolescents either repeated new French words while clapping out their rhythmic structure (clapping condition) or only repeated the words (non-clapping condition). Participants’ oral production before and after training was (1) perceptually rated for accentedness by two French native speakers and (2) acoustically analysed for final syllable duration. While the results showed an only near-significant improvement from pretest to posttest in accentedness ratings for the clapping group, a significant improvement was obtained for acoustic durational measures. Individual musical abilities did not interact significantly in either of the two analyses, and working memory interacted significantly only with accentedness. These results show that a short training session in which clapping is used to highlight the prosodic structure of words can help improve pronunciation in a foreign language.",0
"Predictors of Taking Elective Music Courses in Middle School Among Low-SES, Ethnically Diverse Students in Miami","Researchers attempting to show that music has positive effects on children need to understand and control for preexisting differences between those who do and do not select into musical participation in the first place. Within a large-scale, communitywide, prospective, longitudinal study of predominantly low-income, ethnically diverse students (N = 31,332), we examined characteristics of students who did and did not enroll in music elective courses (band, choir, orchestra, guitar, other) in public middle schools (sixth, seventh, and eighth grades) in Miami. Predictor variables included gender, ethnicity, poverty, special education, English language learner status, fifth-grade English proficiency, prior academic performance (fifth-grade grade point average [GPA], standardized math and reading test scores), and initial school readiness skills (social, behavioral, cognitive, language, and motor skills) at age 4. Only 23% of middle school students enrolled in a music class in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade, with band having the highest enrollment, followed by choir, orchestra, and guitar. Being male and having greater cognitive skills at age 4 and higher fifth-grade GPA and reading skills were related to later music participation. Black students, students in special education, and those not proficient in English were less likely to participate in middle school music classes. Results varied somewhat by type of music.",0

Estrategias para Mejorar la Comprensión Lectora: Impacto de un Programa de Intervención en Español,"El objetivo de este estudio consistió en evaluar la efectividad de un programa de intervención en español, LEE comprensivamente, para mejorar la comprensión lectora. El programa de intervención se basó en la enseñanza explícita de habilidades de alto nivel vinculadas al procesamiento del texto (construcción de inferencias, control metacognitivo y conocimiento de la estructura textual) y de bajo nivel (vocabulario). El programa consistió en 16 sesiones de 80 minutos durante 8 semanas. Un total de 127 niños de entre 8 y10 años de diferentes escuelas de Buenos Aires se distribuyeron en dos grupos, experimental y control. Los procesos evaluados incluyeron medidas generales de comprensión lectora y específicas, de vocabulario, control metacognitivo e inferencias, antes y después de la intervención. Solo el grupo que recibió la intervención mostró mejoras estadísticamente significativas en la comprensión lectora frente al grupo control. Estos hallazgos sugieren que la intervención centrada en los ejes descritos mejora significativamente la comprensión lectora de los niños dentro de la escuela.Alternate abstract:     The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an instructional program in Spanish to improve reading comprehension, LEE comprensivamente. The program’s framework was based on targeting text level processes, in particular, inference making, meta-cognitive control, and knowledge of text structure. In addition, a word level process, such as vocabulary, was also trained. The program, which consisted of 16 80-minute sessions during a period of 8 weeks, was tested on 127 children of ages 8-10 from different schools in Buenos Aires. A parallel group remained as passive control in each class group. Assessing processes included vocabulary, monitoring, inference making, and reading comprehension general measures, before and after the intervention. Only the intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement. These findings suggest that interventions focused on skills related to vocabulary, inference making, monitoring, and the knowledge of text structure improve reading comprehension in a school setting.Alternate abstract:Plain Language Summary     Given the high percentage of students in Argentina and Latin America who have difficulty understanding texts according to national and international assessments, the aim of this study was to verify the results of an intervention to improve reading comprehension (RC) in children aged 8 to 10 from different schools in Buenos Aires, Argentina based on the explicit teaching of basic language skills and more complex cognitive skills.     Successful RC is dependent on higher level processes that lead to a coherent representation of the text meaning referred to as either a situational model (Kintsch, 1988) or a mental model (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Students need to build deep, interconnected, and coherent knowledge that includes understanding of potential causal relationships requiring a variety of skills or processes to link background knowledge with ideas expressed in the text. Most readers need strategy instruction to improve this process and it is particularly necessary and effective for those students that are struggling most, mainly those with weak domain knowledge or lower reading skills (Durkin, 1978; León, 1991a, 1991b; León, 2003; León y Carretero, 1995; León, Escudero, & Olmos, 2012; McNamara, Levinstein, & Boonthum, 2004; Snow, 2002).     One of the main questions that is currently being addressed in the RC field is which processes correlated to meaning construction, and thus proficient RC, are causally related to it and how they relate to each other developmentally. Several experimental approaches have been used to address this subject, such as longitudinal studies and comparison of poor comprehenders with a younger comprehension-age match group. A third valid alternative is training studies. Training studies have the advantage of being able to train a specific skill and then measure the impact of training on reading comprehension. Various training programs have been implemented to help children of this age group with comprehension (Clarke et al., 2010; McNamara et al., 2004) and emphasize the importance of teaching reading comprehension strategies. Significant work has shown that questioning approaches, explicit inference instruction, or a combination of both improves reading comprehension (Hansen & Pearson, 1983; McGee & Johnson, 2003; Pressley, Levin, Ghatala, & Ahmad, 1987; Yuill & Joscelyne, 1988; Yuill & Oakhill, 1988).     Oakhill and Cain (2007) identify causal relations between some skills and abilities with reading comprehension and suggest that these processes might be trained. The three abilities they identified are inference making, monitoring, and knowledge of text structure. In addition, we considered for our training study deep vocabulary knowledge.     *  Inference making. All texts have gaps that the reader needs to fill with previous knowledge. This process, known as inference making, is considered to be the key to successful reading comprehension (Cain & Oakhill, 1999; León 2003). Making an inference means using clues from the text and connecting world knowledge and experience to figure out the author’s message and is regarded as a central component of skilled reading (Garnham & Oakhill, 1996; Graesser, Singer & Trabasso, 1994; Oakhill, 1984; Singer & O’Connell, 2003; van den Broek, 1994).     *  Comprehension monitoring is the ability to reflect on what has just been read. This ability develops over the primary school years (Markman, 1981) and without it comprehension itself will be affected. Monitoring enables the reader to detect when an inference is required, if the text content or idea is difficult to understand or is contradictory, whether the meaning of a word or phrase is not known, or if the meaning of the word is not appropriate to the context. Children with reading comprehension difficulties are poor at detecting internal inconsistencies in text and difficulties are more pronounced when the wrong pieces of information are nonadjacent (Oakhill et al., 2005; Yuill et al., 1989). Good readers use metacognitive strategies to think about and have control over their reading (Oakhill et al., 2005). Before reading, they might clarify their purpose for reading and preview the text. During reading, they might monitor their understanding, adjusting their reading speed to fit the difficulty of the text and amending any comprehension problems they have. After reading, they check their understanding of what they have read. Students who are good at monitoring their comprehension know when they understand what they read and when they do not. They have strategies to solve any problems in their understanding as the problems arise     *  Knowledge of text structure is one of the skills that help the reader to detect the ideas in a text and build a coherent meaning based representation. Lack of such understanding is a source of comprehension failure. Good and poor comprehenders differ in their ability to select the correct main point of a story (León & Carretero, 1995; Oakhill & Cain, 2012; Oakhill et al., 2003; Yuill & Oakhill, 1991).     *  Vocabulary knowledge is a word level process that is strongly correlated with reading comprehension and is important both in learning to recognize individual words (Nation, 1998; Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996) and in text comprehension (McKeown, Omanson, & Perfetti, 1983; Stahl, 1983). Deep vocabulary knowledge supports inference making, though several researchers have shown that many children have reading comprehension difficulties even when vocabulary knowledge is controlled for (Cain & Oakhill, 2006).     The research question of this study was to test whether LEEcomprensivamente (Gottheil et al., 2011), a program whose framework was based on training the higher-level skills proposed to be causally related to reading comprehension during development, together with vocabulary, could be a successful strategy to implement in class. To answer this question the program was tested on 4th graders and outcomes compared to a passive control. Only the intervention group showed significant improvements in all measures; no changes were detected in the control group.     The emphasis on early grades in school is to accurately and fluently recognize words, though reading achievement by 4th grade turns towards comprehension skills. Typically, developing children in these ages tend to focus on the different aspects of reading, but they need explicit instruction to develop reading comprehension of different types of texts. For many years schools have assumed that children’s comprehension would naturally develop once they were able to decode, and instruction in reading comprehension was not an important goal.     Only the intervention group showed significant improvements in the measures of reading comprehension evaluated, in the comprehension of the text structure, inferences and vocabulary. Changes were observed in self-regulation measures; however, these did not have the expected amplitude. The changes that occurred in the IG were related to the time variable (pretest and posttest). The hypothesis of this study was that the success of the program in increasing RC relied not only on the skills that were trained, but also on the way the program was administered. The “before reading” session aimed at activating previous knowledge and increasing vocabulary; “during reading” emphasis was put on regulating speed and monitoring comprehension; and “after reading” activities were centered on inference making and understanding text structure. Through practice and feedback, students got to collectively construct meaning. Trained educational psychologists administered the program. A question that remains to be answered is whether teachers with no previous training may carry out this type of intervention in the class and lead to significant improvements in reading comprehension as the ones reported here.",0
Instructional Practices when Using Video Authentic Resources in the FLES Classroom,"There has been an increase of new foreign language in elementary schools’ (FLES) programs in the K-12 context across the United States. With this growth, it is important to understand what is occurring in existing FLES programs to support these new implementations. Experts from a variety of contexts in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) have reported that using authentic resources (AR) for instructional practices reduces affective influences on SLA and increases student learning outcomes (Bacon & Finneman, 1990; Rodngam, & Somphong, 2011). Authentic resources are media created by the target culture for the target culture and not crafted specifically for language teaching and learning. Additionally, the growth of video sharing websites has increased the availability of video authentic resources (VAR). Faculty in the elementary world language context have used VAR for instruction and reported improved learning outcomes, proficiency, engagement, and enthusiasm when teaching with VAR.     	While many reports have shown the impact of AR on SLA, there is little information about instructional practices with VAR or about alignment of VAR with instructional goals in FLES programs. Thus, the focus of this study is on understanding the instructional practices of FLES teachers when using VAR. This study was conceptualized using socio-cultural theory (SCT) and communicative language teaching (CLT) to better understand the instructional applications of VAR in the FLES context.               Using a basic qualitative approach, FLES practitioners were observed teaching with VAR and then interviewed about their instructional practices with VAR. The analysis of data contributed examples of these instructional practices with VAR and how the participants align VAR to instructional goals. The variety of instructional practices included pausing and muting the VAR to encourage listening and speaking skills, total physical response with VAR containing music, multiple student exposures to VAR, and engaging students as a means of lowering their affective filters. As a whole, this study provides insight into the instructional practices of FLES teachers with VAR, provides implications for FLES teachers’ professional practices with VAR, and offers recommendations for continued research.",0
Effects of Music Education on Academic Achievement,"This study aims at exploring whether English Language Learners (ELL) who are enrolled in a music education program have higher standardized test scores compared to those who are not engaged in a music education program.  A West Phoenix, inner city school was studied were the majority of students are Hispanic and qualify for free and reduced lunch. The main purpose of this dissertation was to analyze the effects of instrumental music courses on the AZmerit assessment scores.  AZMerit is a standardized assessment used to measure student growth during the given timeframe of one school year (AIMS A Science, n.d.). In this study, I compared a cohort of instrumental music students who studied performance against a cohort of comparable students who did not volunteer to participate in an instrumental music program.  Many of these students are bilingual in English and Spanish.  As such, students were divided into subcategories based on their level of language acquisition in sixth grade. The secondary purpose of this study was to determine if being a part of an instrumental music program affected students at different languages levels in different manners. Over a two-year period, the English Language Learners (ELL) students were examined to determine the effects of music education by focusing a large part of this research on ELL students’ success within music education programs and academic content areas.",0
Newcomer English Language Learners in High School Choral Music Education: An Ethnographic Case Study,"This five month long ethnographic case study seeks to add to the limited literature on Newcomers enrolled in choir (Carlow, 2006), by understanding the role a focused choral music education plays in their ability to listen, speak, read, and write in the English language.  The study also seeks to contribute to the literature connecting language learning and choral music education. The purpose of the study was to understand Newcomer English language learners’ (NELs) experiences of practice and performance in high school choir, as it relates to language learning and social belonging. Cultural Historical Activity Theory framed my study which allowed me to explore the activity system of NELs in a focused choral music education. Using purposive sampling, the study included four NELs enrolled in choir and was conducted at Desert City High School, located on the U.S.- Mexico border. Newcomer English learners are a fast-growing population in public schools (Short & Boyson, 2012). Newcomers face both social and academic challenges, as it has been determined that it takes three to five years to socially develop a new language (Cummins, 1984; Echevarria, Short, & Powers, 2006). This study revealed that NELs face extreme systemic challenges during the registration and scheduling process of coursework. Findings suggest that having a bilingual counselor is not sufficient to help NELs placed into the right courses, especially for elective coursework.  Findings further suggest that choir provided an opportunity to develop social capital, something that assisted the NELs gain confidence in their ability to sing and speak in English.  Through the actions of bonding, bridging, and linking, the NELs were able to build their self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-knowledge in order to perform tasks they had never thought they could achieve. Findings also suggest that performance preparation assisted in the language learning process for the NELs in the chorus by developing communicative competence in the forms of linguistic, discourse, and strategic. An important finding is how the students used their Spanish phonology to understand and make meaning of the English phonology in preparation for their performances.",1

Goldilocks versus Goldlöckchen: Visual speech preference for same‐rhythm‐class languages in 6‐month‐old infants,"The present study investigated German‐learning 6‐month‐old infants' preference for visual speech. Visual stimuli in the infants' native language (German) were contrasted with stimuli in a foreign language with similar rhythmical characteristics (English). In a visual preference task, infants were presented with 2 side‐by‐side silent video clips of the same speaker reciting a nursery rhyme simultaneously in German and English. To assess spontaneous preference for native or non‐native visual speech, we computed preference scores towards the English‐ and German‐speaking faces. The findings of the present study revealed a sex difference in visual speech preference. Only female infants exhibited a visual preference, by attending longer to the English‐speaking face. Notably, the present study provides the first evidence for sex differences in visual speech preference in infancy.HighlightsVisual speech preference was tested in 6‐month‐old German‐learning infants.Infants were tested with a preferential looking task contrasting German and English language.Only female infants displayed a visual preference toward English visual speech suggesting a sex difference in infants' visual speech processing.",0
The potential for music to develop pronunciation in students with English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D),"Australia is a culturally and linguistically diverse country, with a large proportion of the population originating from non-English speaking countries. One of the significant challenges for non-English speakers living in Australia is the ability to verbally communicate in English. Twenty to 25% of children in Australian schools have English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D) (Commonwealth of Australia, 2016; Hammond, 2014). These students can struggle in the classroom as they both learn the English language, whilst being taught in the English language which they may have little to no working function knowledge (Kibler, Valdés, & Walqui, 2014). Further, intelligibility of communication can be affected as a result of poor pronunciation in the target language. This research investigated the potential of an eight-week music intervention, which drew upon principles of audiation from Gordon's Music Learning Theory, for developing pronunciation in students with EAL/D. Results indicated that five of the six student participants with EAL/D demonstrated improvements in their pronunciation when speaking in English as a result of the intervention. This research indicates positive correlations between the use of a specific music intervention drawing on principles of audiation and the development of pronunciation for students with EAL/D. Recommendations for future research in this area have been presented.",1
Teaching Music in English: A Content- Based Instruction Model in Secondary Education,"Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in the teaching and learning of several languages in an attempt to generate multilingual education opportunities, particularly in Europe. In response to the demands of our globalized society, Content-Based Instruction (CBI), which has also been referred to as ""immersion and Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programs,"" emerged as a teaching approach that combines the learning of curricular contents and the communicative competence in the target language. This study was carried out at a public high school set in a Spanish bilingual community, where music is taught through a CLIL approach in English class. The purpose of this paper is to examine how students value their music lessons in English and to check the adequacy of teaching music as a subject in English. To achieve this goal, materials adapted to their level of proficiency and a final questionnaire were designed. Results indicate that students are satisfied with this proposal, since they consider these music lessons to be easier than the regular ones. Not only did they enjoy being exposed to English in these music lessons, but a considerable number of students would also like to take a CLIL program in the near future. Pedagogical implications to this CBI model account for the development of learners' autonomy, the use of audio-visual aids and further research in bilingual and multilingual regions overseas.Alternate abstract:En los últimos años, ha habido un gran interés en la enseñanza y el aprendizaje de lenguas con el propósito de crear nuevas oportunidades en lo que concierne a la educación multilingüe. En respuesta a las demandas de nuestra sociedad, la enseñanza basada en contenidos, también conocida como ""Aprendizaje Integrado de Contenidos y Lenguas Extranjeras"" (AICLE), surgió como un enfoque que permite a los estudiantes aprender los contenidos de una asignatura en una lengua extranjera. Este artículo presenta un estudio llevado a cabo en un centro público de educación secundaria obligatoria, situado en una comunidad autónoma bilingüe de España, en el cual se enseña una unidad didáctica de música utilizando dicho enfoque en la asignatura de Inglés. El objetivo es determinar cómo valoran los estudiantes sus clases de música en inglés y comprobar la idoneidad de que una asignatura como música sea impartida en inglés. Para alcanzar este objetivo, se diseñaron una serie de materiales y cuestionarios adaptados a su dominio de la lengua meta. Los resultados sugieren que los alumnos están satisfechos con esta propuesta, pues consideran que estas clases de música son más fáciles. Los estudiantes no solo estuvieron expuestos al inglés en sus clases de música, sino que a un número considerable de estudiantes les gustaría cursar un programa AICLE en un futuro. Las implicaciones pedagógicas de este modelo de enseñanza basado en contenidos se centran en el desarrollo de la autonomía de los estudiantes, el uso de herramientas audiovisuales y la investigación en regiones bilingües y multilingües.Alternate abstract:Nos últimos anos tem havido um grande interesse no ensino e aprendizagem de línguas com o objetivo de criar novas oportunidades em termos de educaçao multilíngue.

Editorial,"The last century has been described as the century of 'self', during which individuals emerged as the major focus for research in social sciences. In language education, researchers have been long exploring individual language learners' contributions to the language learning process, especially since the 1990s, culminating into publication of Michael Breen's (2001) edited volume on Learner Contributions to Lan-guage Learning. Likewise, this interest in individual learners' role in language learning reciprocates the increased attention being paid to language teachers' cognition of teaching (e.g., Andrews, 2007; Borg, 2015). Accompanying such interests in individual learners' and teachers' cognition, there is also a grow-ing awareness that language learning and teaching are not just about cognition. Language learning and teaching are now believed to involve a social process in which language learners/teachers constantly posi-tion themselves favorably and are being positioned by various counterparts in the same process (e.g., Gao, 2010; Tao & Gao, 2017). The need for researchers to examine such interactions in the language learning and teaching process motivates continuous efforts to explore identities and English language education. Works such as Norton (2000), Block (2007), Barkhuizen (2017) and Pavlenko and Blackledge (2004) have revealed the complexity of social relations and the significance of identity as a conceptual lens to gain insights into the dynamics of language learning and teaching. These works have been mostly produced in non-Asian contexts where migrant language learners and language teachers need to cope with various challenges in helping migrant language learners improve linguistic competence for adaptation to host communities. In such contexts, who we are and what we would like to be regarded as become fundamental questions that every language teacher and migrant language learner needs to address. In Asian contexts where English is largely promoted as a foreign language, Block (2007) even argued that 'the prospects of TL-mediated subject positions in the FL context are minimal to non-existent' (p. 137). Nevertheless, identity in English language education has emerged to be a major concern for English language educators and policymakers in Asian contexts.     In Asia, we have witnessed ongoing waves of enthusiasm for learning English despite the fact that most Asian countries have long-standing historical and cultural traditions, which might be undermined by such craving for English and its cultural products (e.g., pop songs and movies). For instance, in China, one of the major Asian countries, English has always been treated with some ambiguity by the political estab-lishment since the language is often associated with powerful aggressors historically (e.g., Adamson, 2002; Bolton, 2003). In Japan, there has been an ongoing debate on how to maintain its national integrity in light of the popular crush for English (e.g., Kubota, 1998; Liddicoat, 2007). Despite such reservations, Asian countries are embracing the English language and see it as a key to globalization in which they can access knowledge and capital for development. Amidst such ambiguity, researchers have begun to show great interest in exploring the identity issue in English language education. For example, Gao and cohort researchers have conducted a series of studies on Chinese learners of English focusing on identity and motivation against the background of the craze for learning English in preparation for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing (e.g., Xu & Gao, 2014). As Olympics will be held again in 2020 in Tokyo, Japan is probably witnessing a new wave of enthusiasm for learning English, sparkling debates on English and national identity. Recent developments in countries like USA and UK raise the question as to whether globaliza-tion has encountered serious challenges, but in Asia, most countries still value globalization as a crucial strategy for them to achieve development. The identity issue in English language education has also maintained its attraction as an important research topic.     This special issue addresses this growing interest in English language learners' and teachers' identities amidst cultural, educational, political and social changes that have been happening in Asian contexts. English language educators, educational administrators and policy makers now have to consider increas-ingly complex identity issues inside and outside language classrooms when designing, promoting and implementing particular English-related policies, curricula and pedagogical practices. In addition, rising voices of language learners and teachers concerning their identities also offer valuable insights concern-ing how language learners' learning and teachers' professional practice can be further enhanced. These growing concerns about learners' and teachers' identities also trigger major conceptual and methodologi-cal shifts in research so that the complexities of identity can be fully explored to inform the development of effective, ethical and sustainable pedagogical approaches. For these reasons, the papers in this special issue appreciate and examine identity-related issues in English language education in situ.     The first 4 articles concern language learners' identities in a variety of contexts. Turnbull's study ad-dresses the complex concept of national and cultural identity in Japan's English language teaching con-text. It draws on an ongoing debate concerning whether the hegemony of the English language will un-dermine or strengthen the nationalistic constructions of the Japanese identity. By exploring the attitudes and perspectives of Japanese students, Turnbull evaluated to what extent these students endorse the na-tionalistic constructions of Japanese identity in relation to the West and how their views can inform the development of English language pedagogy in Japan. Instead of focusing on such interaction between macro contextual discourses and language learner identities, McKinley examines the constructions of Japanese students' writer identity in academic English writing. He probed the selves displayed by Japa-nese students in academic writing in relation to their prior learning experiences. Through an ongoing analysis of Japanese students' written texts, regular student and teacher interviews and classroom obser-vations for a year, he identified that writing instructors' expectations and personal beliefs had profoundly mediated these students' identity constructions. McKinley's findings on the mediation of significant oth-ers such as writing instructors on Japanese students' writer identity development is echoed by Huang's study on Taiwanese adolescent English learners' motivational selves and their parents' expectations. Noting that Taiwanese English learners approach the learning of English as a duty and obligation, Huang advances a cultural and relational understanding of the self system to appreciate these learners' motiva-tion for learning English. He found that Taiwanese adolescent learners of English are expected by their parents to be successful global citizens and assume the learning of English is a part of their societal roles and social obligations. In such contexts, parental expectations and involvement seem to be inseparable from adolescent learners' self development in the motivated language learning process. In contrast to the above-mentioned studies on language learners' identity issues in home contexts, Lee, Hunter and Frank-en's study on an Asian migrant learner's struggle for gaining access to a university degree programme in New Zealand reveals how the learner negotiated with identity constraints imposed on her and transformed herself into a university student and successful language learner. The results have significant implications for policy makers and language educators in helping migrant learners to survive and succeed in new contexts through identity negotiation and reconstruction.     The second cluster of articles consists of 3 studies on English language teachers' identity struggles in mainland China, Thailand and Malaysia. Li and De Costa draw on an agency-centered approach to ex-plore an English language teachers' professional identity in a private language school in mainland China where she is responsible for preparing her students for the IELTS test. They examined how the teacher went beyond what she was expected to do by the private language school and exercised agency in achieving professional identity development as mediated by the contextual affordances and constraints. Loo investigated non-local English teacher identity by focusing on conflicts and agency emergent from their narratives in Bangkok, Thailand. The results suggest that the teacher participants experienced conflicts associated with various stakeholders in the process, such as employers' expectations and students' circumstances. The study also revealed that participants with stronger social support were more willing to accept differences between them and stakeholders with regard to their expectations of teaching. Those with weaker social support were more likely to adapt teaching in response to other stakeholders' expectations or oppose their interference. These results indicate that contextual processes and conditions profoundly mediate the pursuit of professional identities and professional growth. Unlike the aforementioned studies on teachers in private language schools, Adi Badiozaman looks at the academic identity development of English language teachers who had transited from teaching in secondary schools to lecturing in Malaysia's higher education institutions. The study examined how these university English teachers' academic identities evolved and what factors mediate their identity development. Echoing findings from the other two studies, Adi Badiozaman found that participants' self-concepts were dynamic and are mediated by various internal and external factors in both past and present contexts. Self-concept was also found to have played a key role in participants' identity development as it is closely related to motivation and career goals. These findings have important implications for the development of strategies to support university English teachers' transition into Malaysia's higher education institutions.     The aforementioned studies have examined quite a few identity-related issues with largely qualitative methodological approaches but they do not sufficiently capture the variety of contexts whereas readers of this journal grapple with significant identity-related challenges. This limitation has been caused by many constraints on the editing of this special issue, in particular the time given to the editor and authors to produce publishable manuscripts. Nevertheless, this special issue could open up a dialogic space for ongoing identity-related discussions that are of serious concern to readers of this journal in Asia and other contexts.",0
Infants Prefer Infant-Directed Song Over Speech,"In their everyday communication, parents do not only speak but also sing with their infants. However, it remains unclear whether infants' can discriminate speech from song or prefer one over the other. The present study examined the ability of 6- to 10-month-old infants (N = 66) from English-speaking households in London, Ontario, Canada to discriminate between auditory stimuli of native Russian-speaking and native English-speaking mothers speaking or singing to their infants. Infants listened significantly longer to the sung stimuli compared to the spoken stimuli. This is the first study to demonstrate that, even in the absence of other multimodal cues, infant listeners are able to discriminate between sung and spoken stimuli, and furthermore, prefer to listen to sung stimuli over spoken stimuli.",0
Beyond Bilingual,"Beyond Bilingual Making storytime inviting to all English language learners A BILINGUAL STAFF MEMBER RECALLS CHATTING with a Spanish-speaking mother who frequented storytime at the Cypress Hills Library, a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) located in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY.     According to information from the U.S. Census, more than 300 languages are spoken across the United States (ow.ly/7Irx30bYPhG).     Speaking two languages actually benefits children's overall learning, marked by larger vocabularies, flexible problem-solving skills, and higher-level cognitive abilities (ow.ly/WMkz30bYP2B).      ""Bilingual storytime is a natural environment for English language learners to hear stories and songs that are culturally and linguistically relevant, supporting both their ethnic identity and language development.""     Since the fall of 2016, we have offered 328 sessions and we plan to make this program a regular part of our early literacy offerings.     Abby Garnett, a supervisor at our Cypress Hills Library branch, is enthusiastic about the outreach benefits of the program, which she scheduled adjacent to an English language discussion group.     Karen MacPherson, children's and youth services coordinator at the Takoma Park (MD) Library, enthusiastically includes English language learners in the storytime community.",0
The effects of home reading activities during preschool and Grade 4 on children's reading performance in Chinese and English in Hong Kong,"The English and Chinese reading proficiency of 1376 Grade 4 students in 24 Hong Kong primary schools were assessed using measures developed for the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study. Students' parents provided information about home reading activities (HRA) aimed at supporting their children's reading prior to them entering school (""early home reading activities"", EHRA) and during Grade 4 (""home reading activities""). Results indicated that EHRA was a stronger predictor of reading performance in both Chinese and English than HRA. Moreover, 'typical' HRA such as reading books, telling stories and singing songs were found to be predictive of reading performance in both Chinese and English. In English, in addition, playing word games or character puzzles were also activities beneficial to reading performance. Together, these results provide evidence for the beneficial effects of traditional early childhood activities at home such as book reading, telling stories and singing songs for reading performance in later primary school in children's first as well as second language.",0
Writing with Children: From Teacher to Writer,"Hiberno-English as spoken by Travellers differs from the settled community and includes remnants of the Cant language, which predates Old Irish.) I realized there were no books for children with Travellers in them, and neither were there any appropriate pre-reading resources that recognized and celebrated Traveller culture.  [...]I started to collect Traveller nursery rhymes with a view to approaching a publisher.  Children illustrated the nursery rhymes and jokes and contributed to the design features of the final layout.",0
Teaching English to Indian Vernacular Medium Students Through Technology: A Qualitative Study of the Kolkata Jesuit Juniorate Program,"The educational system in India is inadequate to meet the modern needs of the Indian students (Lall & House, 2005). Primarily two kinds of education coexist: Vernacular medium and English medium. These styles have pushed many students to a disadvantageous position. The vernacular medium students, due to lack of English proficiency, are not able to do their university studies for the medium of instruction in Indian Universities is English only (Dravid, 2013). It is, therefore, an injustice done to the Indian vernacular medium students.   The last two centuries have seen technology rapidly advancing in all spheres of life (Jerald, 2009). These modern technologies are being used to instruct students effectively (Hicks, 2011; Ferrell & Ferrell, 2002; Singhal, 1997. Several studies (Compton & Compton, 2013; D’Angelo & Wooley, 2007; Frank, 2008) discovered that utilizing modern technology as an instructional tool was an effective way of teaching English to speakers of other languages to become proficient in English skills such as: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.   As a response to the inadequate educational system of India and to be in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church and the Society of Jesus, Kolkata Jesuit Juniorate Program from the academic year 2012 -13, has been extensively using modern technology to teach English to the Jesuit seminarians. Therefore, the study was conducted among the seminarians enrolled in Kolkata Jesuit Juniroate Program from the academic year 2012-13 to 2016-17. The study collected data that included a researcher-constructed online survey aiming to gather data that would lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem (Creswell, 2014). The survey was conducted among the graduates of Kolkata Jesuit Juniorate Program. The researcher sent out online surveys to the graduates of Kolkata Jesuit Juniorate Program.   The findings revealed that teaching English through technology has yielded positive outcomes. On the other hand, the data also revealed that no standard syllabus existed for all the groups from 2012 to 2017. Because of this, the responses were different from one group to the other. The overall conclusion of the study is that technology integrated instruction has been positive.",0
Stereotype or grammar? The representation of gender when two-year-old and three-year-old French-speaking toddlers listen to role nouns,"Using a preferential looking paradigm, the current study examined the role that grammatical gender plays when preschool French-speaking toddlers process role nouns in the masculine form (e.g., chanteurs masculine 'singers'). While being auditorily prompted with ""Look at the 'a role noun'!"", two- and three-year-olds were presented with two pictures of two characters ('boy-boy' versus 'girl-boy') with attributes of the given role noun (e.g., singers with microphone and music notes). All role nouns were presented in the masculine plural form, which, despite its use to refer to mixed-gender groups, can be interpreted as referring to men. We expected toddlers to be biased by stereotypes, yet when non-stereotypical role nouns were presented, toddlers were not influenced by grammatical gender, but by their own sex (even more so for three-year-old toddlers). The absence of sensitivity to grammatical cues for either age group is discussed in terms of the developmental awareness of grammatical gender.",0
FIVE QUESTIONS FOR Alice Renton,"Later on, in the U.S., American parents would say things like, ""If you don't give grades, how do you know if they're learning?"" ""If there's no competition, how will they succeed in a competitive society?"" or ""Well, this is okay for little children, but what happens when they get to real school?"" As Montessorians continue to focus on the authentic needs of the whole child, we are still bucking contemporary culture: allowing children to do things at their own pace and according to their sensitive periods, rather than on a rapid, adult- i mposed timetable; emphasizing normalization or self-direction through freely chosen work done with the hands and involving a child's whole personality; providing peaceful, collaborative spaces where children can develop respect for self, others, and the environment; and encouraging outdoor time and avoiding overuse of computers and electronic devices.     Often, children will naturally absorb second language vocabulary from hearing it around them; (3) A separate line time for each language, using songs, rhymes, finger plays, movement activities such as TPR (total physical response), and Grace and Courtesy lessons; (4) Using the elements of a multicultural focus inherent in the Montessori environment, make experiences with the geography, science, and history materials, including music, dance, food, arts, and celebrations of specific cultures-especially those to which the children belong-a natural part of classroom life.     At the Elementary level in the public schools, other obstacles might be the pressure of high-stakes testing, the emphasis on technology as a teaching device, and the need to align the teaching of certain subjects with the current public school curriculum.",0
Fostering children’s music in the mother tongue in early childhood education: A case study in Zambia,"The influence that the use of a familiar language has on learning has long been explored with suggestions that a child’s mother tongue is the most suited initial language of instruction in school. In Zambia, however, this is not the case as the majority of people think that young children should learn to speak in English as soon as possible because this is the language of education. As a result, songs in English dominate the singing repertoire in pre-schools even when children have not mastered sufficient English vocabulary. Singing songs in English, just as teaching children in a language they do not understand, has been shown to hamper learning. The theoretical lens of indigenous African education underpins the study in order to investigate how music in the mother tongue in a cultural context can foster educational aims. Research participants included an expert in Zambian indigenous children’s songs who also acted as resource person and led 18 children aged between 5 and 6 years in sessions of music in their mother tongue. The findings of the study revealed that educational implications of children’s participation in music in the mother tongue can be found in the way in which they are organised, the activities they involve and in the music elements that characterise them.",0
Lyrical music and second language acquisition: A study on the use of children's songs as a strategy for Hul'qumi'num' language revitalization,"The use of lyrical music to aid in the revitalization of Hul’qumi’num’, a dialect spoken on southeastern Vancouver Island, is a strategy that builds on the connections between music and language. These connections are evident in both infant- or child-directed speech and music. In 2008 and 2010, a group of dedicated volunteers wrote and recorded two collections of children’s songs in English and Hul’qumi’num’. This study examined the usefulness of these CDs in the context of how lyrical music aids in second language acquisition.   This qualitative study features the perspectives of Hul’qumi’num’ language instructors on their use of the ’Iiyus Siiye’yu Happy Friends CDs with students in School District 79. Data collected from focus groups and individual interviews with Hul’qumi’num’ language instructors and Aboriginal Support teachers, a principal, and two co-creators of the CDs were analyzed using pattern, theme and content analysis. This provided a clearer picture of how the CDs were distributed and how students were exposed to the songs in classrooms.   Motivation and comfort levels of language instructors were two themes that emerged and led to an important question: can partially fluent speakers teach Hul’qumi’num’? Hul’qumi’num’ is a dynamic and living language that has experienced substantial changes in the past century and as the number of fluent speakers continues to dwindle, there will continue to be substantial changes to the language.   Recommendations arising from this research included the development of 1. An accompanying CD that includes vocabulary lists for each song and verbal instructions to transitioning listeners; 2. Print-based materials that support using the vocabulary from each song; 3. More songs about the teachings, legends, and other stories that share history, geography, and cultural practices with listeners; and, 4. A resource guide that includes physical activities that encourages movement inside and outside classrooms.   Future research with classroom teachers is needed to better understand their needs and to ensure appropriate supports are in place so that they can continue to support the promotion and use of Hul’q’umi’num’ in classrooms.",0
Empathy in future teachers of the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia,"This study analyzes cognitive and emotional empathy in students who started their training at the Education Science Faculty of the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia. The sample was formed by 317 students enrolled in the study programs of Preschool, Plastic Arts, Natural Sciences, Physical Education, Philosophy, Computer Science, Foreign Languages, Mathematics, Music, Psychopedagogy, and Social Sciences. The Cognitive and Affective Empathy Scale (TECA for its Spanish initials) was used to collect data. Both the reliability of TECA and its construct validity were determined for this sample. Participants obtained better results in the cognitive dimension, the highest scores additionally corresponding to the emotional understanding scale. As far as gender is concerned, women outperformed men in their scores, especially in the two affective dimension scales. Differences also appeared according to age, scores growing as age increased. With regard to the training program in which students were enrolled, significant contrasts were identified in perspective adoption and empathic stress. Finally, a suggestion is made about the need for teacher training curricula to envisage empathy development for the purpose of strengthening the emotional skills of future lecturers.",0
La dramatización musical del romancero en Educación Primaria para el desarrollo de la competencia social y ciudadana/The musical dramatization of the Spanish ballads in Primary Education as a tool for developing social and civic competences,"The persistence of a behaviorist methodology with traditional roots, supported by specialized teaching of subjects arranged in a deliberately disjointed manner, decreases any possible realization of interdisciplinary projects aimed at the creation of an integrated curriculum. It also impedes the proper development of basic competences set in the current educational context of European convergence. In this sense, an intertextual methodology connecting poetry and music, through musical dramatizations inspired in romances from the Spanish anthology Flor nueva de romances viejos, by Ramón Menéndez Pidal, with music by the folklorist Joaquín Díaz González, is presented in the areas of art Education and Spanish language and Literature of Primary Education. The main aim of this project is to develop social and civic competences. The social, cooperative, expressive, communicative and playful nature of the musical dramatization, as a pedagogical tool, encourages students to improve their social skills, emotional development, committed and responsible teamwork, critical understanding of the reality represented, a respectful and supportive dialogue and, ultimately, the pursuit of peaceful and democratic coexistence, in connection with the purposes pursued in the acquisition of social and civic competences.",0
"Social semiotics, education, and identity: Creating trajectorie for youth at schools to demonstrate knowledge and identity as language <i>users</i>","This dissertation is comprised of three teacher-researcher studies carried out with the intention of showing teachers how to move beyond the monolingual paradigm to build upon linguistic and cultural diversity in their everyday practice. The monolingual paradigm is linked to ideologies regarding proficiency in English as the principle means of academic success and citizenship. These studies challenge this traditional way of viewing education by treating learning “as an emerging property of whole persons’ legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice” (Lave, 1991, p. 63), whether these are interest-based communities of practice beyond the classroom or bilingual communities of practice within the classroom. In order to recognize and explain this learning and inform teaching practices, I adopt a social semiotic approach in order to explore how meaning is constructed through language, and also through social interactions with all modern aspects of society, including gesture, image, performance, and music (Kress, 2012; van Leeuwen, 2005). I explore how these interactions allow youth to create diverse identities, beyond immigrant, refugee, limited English proficient, learner, and “other”, in three educational arenas: 1) Outside of the classroom in interest-based communities of practice at school, 2) in a secondary dual-language content classroom, and 3) online in an educational transnational telecollaboration project. In all three studies I triangulate quantitative data of student participation and academic achievement with qualitative participant narratives and teacher-researcher observations. What results is insight into the impact of creating multimodal trajectories for youth to perform identities and knowledge as language  users in schools, where historically messages of youth’s social identities are ascribed in much more constricting ways (Harklau, 2003). Viewing these youth as language users, rather than learners, sends a message to both educators and youth that in education, identity formation trumps skills development, and this can lead to higher expectations, more engaging learning, and opportunities for youth to question race-language educational legacies (Malsbary, 2014; Wenger, 1998).",0
Early Language Learning for All: Examination of a Prekindergarten French Program in an Inclusion Setting,"This preliminary study examined a prekindergarten multimodal French program conducted for students in an inclusion charter school. Due to the age and varied ability levels of the students, media such as video and songs combined with kinesthetic activities served as the primary instructional approach. Data on children's ability to understand and use simple language were obtained from video recordings as well as from vocabulary recognition and recall measures. Additional data from teacher questionnaires showed that students of all abilities developed basic communication skills in French and demonstrated enjoyment of the French program.",0

Meet Coeditor Renee Dowling,"he fine arts have significantly helped form who I am. As a young girl, I was very shy. Each year the comment on my report card was ""Renee needs to contribute more in class discussions."" In years when teachers used the fine arts to enhance learning, I came alive. My Grade 4 teacher played classical music to which we used our imaginations to write stories. My Grade 6 teacher brought her love of music into the classroom by having us sing in French, make puppet shows and act while speaking French. Finally, this shy child found the courage and confidence to participate in class and learned a great deal because of her teachers' innovation. We participated in a school operetta and formed lifelong memories. ¿Another Grade 6 teacher had us sing Robert Frost's poem ""The Road Not Taken,"" and that made all the difference. All these teachers were exposing us to roads less travelled, engaging us and helping us to think, learn and remember through the fine arts.     I hope to bring you ideas from southern ¿Alberta and introduce you to all kinds of people who use, live and. breathe fine arts to inspire thinking, creativity, imagination and learning in their students' lives. This issue includes great ideas to help your students build collaborative skills, problem solving and creativity from Medicine Hat School District's art therapist, Carla Thorogood. You will meet Deb Forbes, a college professor, artist and school board member, who works collaboratively to help primary teachers and their students to learn about their communities and to promote fine arts. Dalyce Harrison, a Grade 4 specialist, will share her ideas of using fine arts and Native studies to engage her students. Darrel Maier will show how he reviews music terms with his students in a games tournament. Peter Me Whir, FAC past president and past editor of A Fine Facta, will share his passion for drama by describing ideas and assessment. You can use his ideas in your drama classes or integrate them into the core subject areas.     Renee Dowling teaches Grade 6 at River Heights Elementary School, in the Medicine Hat School District. Renee is participating in the Inspiring Education Curriculum Redesign Committee and the district's technology committee and is taking piano lessons and online art courses.

Infants' Preferential Attention to Sung and Spoken Stimuli,"Caregivers and early childhood teachers all over the world use singing and speech to elicit and maintain infants' attention. Research comparing infants' preferential attention to music and speech is inconclusive regarding their responses to these two types of auditory stimuli, with one study showing a music bias and another one indicating no differential attention. The purpose of this investigation was to study 11-month-old infants' preferential attention to spoken and sung renditions of an unfamiliar folk song in a foreign language (n = 24). The results of an infant-controlled preference procedure showed no significant differences in attention to the two types of stimuli. The findings challenge infants' well-documented bias for speech over nonspeech sounds and provide evidence that music, even when performed by an untrained singer, can be as effective as speech in eliciting infants' attention.",0
"Marching backwards into the future: the introduction of the English creative music movement in state secondary schools in Victoria, Australia","In 1910, Victoria established an elite form of state secondary education that remained essentially unchanged until the introduction of a progressive curriculum during the late 1960s. This radical and voluntary curriculum introduced child-centred learning and personal development skills to state secondary schools. Many state secondary music teachers took advantage of the reform and introduced the English creative music movement (Rainbow, 1989). As music teachers were unfamiliar with progressive education they would require extensive retraining. Continual disruption to state secondary education during the 1970s, together with the lack of expertise in progressive music education in the Victorian Education Department led to music teachers being given little assistance in developing strategies for teaching creative music. No rationale was developed for creative music education until the late 1980s. As research in music education was in its infancy in Australia during the late 1960s, teachers had little understanding of the difficulties faced by many creative music teachers in England in regard to students developing traditional skills, for example music notation and performance-based skills. Dissatisfaction with progressive education led to the introduction of standards-based education in 1995. Progressive educational theories were no longer considered an important goal. Similar to the late 1960s Victorian education reforms, music teachers received little assistance from the Victorian Education Department. The introduction of standards-based Arts education has seriously reduced the teaching of classroom music throughout the state, leaving many classroom music programmes in a perilous position that is analogous to state music education before the introduction of progressive education in the late 1960s.",0
Songs as Ambient Language Input in Phonology Acquisition,"Children cannot learn to speak a language simply from occasional noninteractive exposure to native speakers' input (e.g., by hearing television dialogues), but can they learn something about its phonology? To answer this question, the present study varied ambient hearing experience for 126 5- to 7-year-old native Cantonese-Chinese speakers learning English as a second language and Putonghua as a second dialect. Hearing Putonghua songs as ambient sounds improved the children's Putonghua accent in a story read-aloud task, whereas hearing English songs yielded no measurable analogous benefit. Research and educational implications are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",1

"A comparative analysis of the academic achievement of band and non-band participants in Craven County, North Carolina","This study was intended to compare the academic achievement of students who participated in high school band classes with non-band participants. A problem of practice study was designed to provide data for principals who were creating transitional or remedial courses to benefit core courses. The creation of these courses presented potential scheduling problems that could be detrimental to music programs. Over 3,900 students were observed and a comparative analysis was performed using the following educational variables: (a) grade point average, (b) English 1 End-of-Course test proficiency, (c) Algebra 1 End-of-Course test proficiency, (d) Biology End-of Course test proficiency, (e) period attendance, (f) number of days of out-of-school suspension, and (g) dropout rates. Data was observed for all traditional high school students during the 2011–2012 school year.    The study indicated that students who participated in at least one band class during the observed year experienced higher academic achievement than non-participants. The academic achievement of band participants was significantly higher than non-participants in six out of seven of the observed variables.",0
Teaching dilemmas: Language development for English learners in a hyper-segregated Dual Immersion program,"English learners (ELs), a growing population in U.S. schools, generally  underperform as compared to their monolingual English peers. One potential solution to this EL achievement gap has been the implementation of Dual Immersion (DI) programs. However, given that ELs are often densely concentrated in schools with limited access to native English-speaking peers, some schools do not have enough native English-speaking  students to constitute a true DI program.     This qualitative study explored language development practices in both Spanish and English in a Northern California hyper-segregated DI elementary school, where almost all the students were English learners. The participants were four Latina and Spanish teachers of kindergarten through fourth grade. The primary research focus was to identify the specific language development practices these teachers used. Secondary questions focused on teachers' use of transfer between languages and reciprocity among  reading, writing, listening and speaking. Three conceptual frameworks that  simultaneously impact ELs were employed to analyze the data: early literacy, second language acquisition, and sociocultural theory.     Research data included three months of classroom observations and interviews with teachers at the beginning, middle and end of the study. The findings revealed that while teachers implemented a variety of language development practices, such as choral practices, instructional conversations about language, and turn-and-talk, they did not ask students to think critically. Additionally, teachers rarely employed transfer or reciprocity.     On a positive note, teachers did actively advocate for primary language  maintenance and second language development. In fact, they evidenced significant agency in doing what they thought was best for their students despite a punitive, chaotic school context, resulting in a lack of a ""program"" in the DI program. Teachers knew they had to adapt the DI model based on their students and did so independently, without the support or knowledge of the site administrators or, in some cases, even their colleagues. Through sharing these significant findings, this study aims to contribute insights to the  challenges of how to best serve English learners in hyper-segregated public schools.",0
A longitudinal analysis of academic English proficiency outcomes for adolescent English language learners in the United States,"The recent availability of nationally mandated academic English proficiency data on all English language learners (ELLs) from landmark United States federal education legislation now makes it possible to track these learners' academic progress longitudinally. Using 5 waves of 9th through 12th grade academic English proficiency data from 2004-2008 for a statewide cohort of 9th grade ELLs (n = 3,702), I employed growth modeling to fit a multilevel model for change in academic English proficiency (Singer & Willett, 2003). I found that the average ELL in my sample started high school performing at an early intermediate level of academic English proficiency and was not projected to reach the score indicating proficiency until the end of 11th grade. Further, U.S.-born ELLs began high school with significantly higher levels of academic English proficiency than their foreign-born ELL peers, but foreign-born ELLs caught up by the end of high school. However, 60% of high school ELLs were born in the U.S. -- implying that large numbers of these students had spent 9 or more years in U.S. schools without developing sufficient academic language needed to perform mainstream academic work in English. The findings emphasize the need for academic language interventions for adolescent ELLs. This study has implications for countries struggling to promote the language development and academic achievement of large numbers of language minority learners. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
Examining Relationships Among Dialect Variation and Emergent Literacy Skills,"This study examined the relationship between nonmainstream American English (NMAE) dialect use and various emergent literacy skills among typically developing children in prekindergarten. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between children's production of NMAE forms (i.e., dialect variation [DVAR]) and their alphabet knowledge, name writing, print concepts, and phonological awareness. The sample of 4-year-olds was diverse: 57.6% were African American and 33.3% participated in free and reduced lunch programs. Moderate, negative significant correlations were found between DVAR and all measures, except name writing. However, with the exception of nursery rhyme awareness, DVAR did not independently contribute to children's performance when it was entered into regression models with related emergent literacy skills as predictor variables. The results suggest an indirect role for NMAE use in emergent literacy achievement and that frequency of spoken NMAE production may be secondary to children's metalinguistic skills.

Becoming fluent in two languages: When and how?,"According to the report from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics (2007), about one quarter of ELLs experiences difficulty speaking English despite the intervention provided to this group of population.  [...] they created a very literate environment for their son and purchased numerous children's books and DVDs of nursery rhymes and cartoons in both the two languages and variety of toys of Henry's interests, among which puzzles are his favorites.",0
Vocabulary acquisition with kindergarten children using song picture books,"Researchers have suggested a connection between music and language development (Lamb and Gregory, 1993), wherein integrating music and literacy activities can optimize student literacy learning. In particular, experiences that develop vocabulary through students’ participation in singing stories that are rich in phonemic patterns, such as rhyme and alliteration, are highly recommended. Combining books with music-integrated literacy experiences can additionally enhance young children’s exposure to language (Wiggins, 2007).   This practice-based research was conducted in an early childhood education setting with four classrooms of kindergarten students, including students with special needs and English language learners, in a vocabulary acquisition experiment.   An Analysis of Variance (one-way ANCOVA) was used with pretests and post-tests of students’ vocabulary prior to and after vocabulary instruction. Two song picture books were read to and sung with students. This research study assessed whether there was a difference in students’ acquisition of vocabulary words when song was used independent of the particular song picture book.   In addition, students’ classroom teachers used an observation protocol for documenting their students’ engagement with the song picture book when it was read and when it was sung. A follow-up interview with students’ teachers by the researcher was conducted to identify any major similarities and/or differences in student engagement.   Finally, each child participating in the study was asked whether they felt singing along with the picture book helped them to learn the ten targeted words in each of the song picture books.    The results of the switching replication quasi-experimental design determined whether students’ singing along with a song picture book significantly increased their vocabulary acquisition.   Keywords: kindergarten, vocabulary development, music, song picture books, brain research.",1
Bilingual balancing act: Multicultural,"Four white, English-speaking pupils out of 200; arrivals and departures almost every day, as transient Eastern European parents come and go; pupils with little experience of school and no idea how to behave in one: how can teachers teach in conditions like that? ""Well, it's not easy,"" says Sheila Taylor, the recently retired headteacher who received a CBE in January for her services to education.  Word got around: 'When you come to Glasgow, go to Annette Street.'"" So the influx continued and a difficult situation grew almost impossible, until the EIS union representative, Jayne Rowe, who is teaching Primary 4 and 5 this year, put forward a motion at last year's AGM, for ""all schools similar to ours to be staffed in a way to support the needs of these children.  Smaller class sizes, more staffing and professional development were all essential, she said then - because ""the Scottish education system is failing the large number of children arriving from the EU on a daily basis"".  Fully immersed in a new world Seated on the floor around teacher Eithne Malik, the P4-5 set of learners with little English are singing action songs at the end of the day, to help with their words: ""Munch, munch, crunch, crunch - what's your favourite food?"" In the absence of words they want, some of the youngsters give the teachers a cuddle on the way out, while three stay behind to chat.",0
Strategic Teaching: Fostering Communication Skills in Diverse Young Learners,"According to the Migration Policy Institute's analysis pf the US Census Bureau's 2009 American Community Survey, 150 languages are spoken among students nationwide who are English language learners, with Spanish the home language of the majority of them (Batalova & McHugh 2010).  A few of the children are DLLs, and some have been diagnosed with special needs in the speech, motor, behavioral, social, and/or cognitive domains.\n This promotes turn taking and speaking and listening skills. * Provide easy access to materials to support children's communication efforts - photos of play areas and play items, crayons and paper, dry erase boards and markers. * Talk with children.  Children with limited expressive language skills or with emotional difficulties may choose a picture to show how they feel. * Allow for multiple means of communication, such as music, dance, drawing, and writing, to encourage learning and development in self-expression, aesthetic appreciation, and motor skills.",0
What does it mean to learn oral and written English language: A case study of a rural Kenyan classroom,"This study was an ethnographic case study that investigated oral and written language learning in a first grade classroom in Kenya. The languages used in this classroom were Swahili and English only. Kamba the mother tongue of the majority of the children, was banned in the entire school. In this classroom there were 89 children with two teachers, one a teacher of English, the other a teacher of Swahili. The children’s ages ranged from five to eight years. The main participants were six focal children with their parents, the two teachers, and the school administrator. Data collection took place over a two and half month period and employed classroom participant observations, audio recording, interviewing, and collection of official documents and children’s writings.    The study was guided by a sociocultural and dialogic framework which maintains that social interactions and cultural institutions (e.g. societies, schools, and classrooms) have important roles to play in a child’s literacy and language development. Thus, the social life of this classroom was central to the children’s literacy and language learning.    The physical, institutional, and policy contexts of this school influenced the nature of social interaction and, thereby, of the language teaching and learning that occurred. To begin, in this classroom, there was a great shortage of literacy and educational materials and space. Moreover, the school’s language policy—that is, English as the language of instruction, Swahili as language of communication, and the banning of Kamba-combined with the physical context shaped the classroom’s practices to a great extent.    As the teacher and the students or students interacted with each other in the classroom, they were involved in different practices or genres and this is what marked the culture of this classroom. There were both official (i.e. teacher controlled) and unofficial practices (i.e. children controlled). On one hand, during the daily English official writing, the teacher followed the mandated curriculum, making adjustments for the lack of the textbooks (i.e., having children copy excerpts on the board). The interaction structure was traditional recitation involving much repetition of the teacher’s words. On the other hand, during the Swahili official writing, reading, and speaking practices, the teacher taught with the same space and text limitations but involved the children in dialogues with her and other students through storytelling, peer guided reading, classroom talk, and drawing. In the Swahili classroom through the teacher’s dialogic instruction and mediation, the children’s voices were recognized and acknowledged. During writing practices the children went beyond copying off the board and drew and colored. Moreover, during unofficial curriculum, the children drew and played together. They drew, wrote, played, or sang songs which focused on their community practices or experiences, identities, and imaginations. Thus, the English conventional practices did not provide insights into the children’s experiences and imaginations as the drawing, storytelling, singing, recitation of poems, and play did during Swahili lessons and during unofficial times. Therefore, drawing, storytelling, singing, recitation of poems, and play should be included in the official English curriculum.    In conclusion, this study manifested that language learning cannot be separated from its ideological, social, and physical contexts. These contexts shape language learning. Also, meaningful dialogues are important for meaningful language learning to occur. And, oral and written language develops simultaneously in a classroom setting. Lastly, written language development is supported by other media such as drawing, play, singing, etc.",0
Third age adult English language learners in nonformal library settings,"There is little research-based and theoretical literature about adult education or English literacy classes in nonformal settings such as library literacy programs in the community (Mathews-Aydinli, 2008; McCook & Barber, 2002b). The purpose of this phenomenological case study was to explore the motivation, learning supports, learning barriers, and program change recommendations of Third Age Learners in a nonformal library ESOL setting. This study provides insight into the demographic variable of linguistically-isolated Third Age English Language Learners (ELLs) participating in a library conversationally-based ESOL program. The results can guide libraries offering services, as well as those considering offering services to these customers (American Library Association [ALA], 2008a).    Data collected included in-depth, face-to-face interviews, classroom observations, documents, learner and teacher essays, researcher journals, and analytic memos. The researcher coded all data with NVivo 8 qualitative software then half of the data was coded with Atlas-TI 5 software by a second coder. A thematic analysis was completed in order to triangulate the data. The purposeful sample consisted of 21 participants at a Florida library adult ESOL program which included 11 learners and 10 teachers. The 11 learners were selected based on their ethnic background, predominantly those of Hispanic background.    Eight learner findings and four teacher-perceived findings were identified in this study. The learner findings included: (a) to understand people at work; (b) to find or expand employment; (c) to practice conversation, pronunciation, listening, grammar and language rules; (d) to meet and get to know people; (e) assiduous teaching; (f) self-directed learning strategies support second language learning success; (g) more publicity, more classes, tutoring, language learning labs, study skills classes, and classroom management training; and (h) lack of family/community support and opportunities to practice English. Teacher-perceived findings mirrored learner findings (a) through (f) and (h), and included: (a) to increase teacher support, communications, and training; (b) to encourage the use of library resources: children's materials; language and music CDs; audiovisual materials, and Internet websites; (c) libraries are safe, supportive, and welcoming environments; and (d) how the “give and take” between learners and teachers is helpful to both. Discussion of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations are included.",0
The relationships of visual and performing arts enrollment of California Standards Test scores in English Language Arts,"THE PROBLEM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the number and type of visual and performing arts (VAPA) courses a high school student took and California Standards Test (CST) English Language Arts (ELA) scores. The study also investigated the same relationship among subgroups' including special education (SpEd) students, English language learners (ELL), and socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) students.    METHOD. A correlational study was conducted. CST ELA scores and VAPA course enrollment were collected for students enrolled in five San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) high schools (Henry, Hoover, Mira Mesa, Morse, and Serra), Grades 8 through 11 from 2005 through 2009. The data provided student designations of SpEd, ELL, and SED, as well as English language proficiency status. VAPA courses included dance, music, theatre, and visual art. Permission to collect data was obtained from the Executive Director of the Resource and Evaluation Division for the SDUSD. A Pearson product-moment correlation was used to determine the extent to which the number of VAPA courses and CST ELA scores were related for all students and for students designated as SpEd, ELL, and SED by English language proficiency status.   RESULTS. The first hypothesis, which predicted a relationship between the number of VAPA courses high school students took and CST ELA scores, was not supported. The second hypothesis, which predicted a relationship between the number of VAPA courses SpEd students took and CST ELA scores, was not supported. The third hypothesis, which predicted a relationship between the number of VAPA courses SED students took and CST ELA scores, was not supported. The fourth hypothesis, which predicted a relationship between the number of VAPA courses ELL students took and CST ELA scores, was not supported. It was concluded that the number of VAPA courses in which high school students enrolled made no significant difference in their CST ELA scores.",0
Culture as the Foundation of Communicative Italian Instruction: Pedagogical Strategies Aimed at Proficiency in Italian,"The purpose of this dissertation is to offer strategies for the integration of culture in the secondary Italian curriculum, while maintaining the assertion that all competent language instruction is rooted in sound cultural objectives.  As illustrated in the subsequent review of pedagogical literature, there are two essential components to the philosophy behind this study: the efficacy of employing cultural concepts in the classroom in order to enhance interpersonal communicative instruction, and the vital role that cultural awareness and sensitivity play in today's world.    Since their inception in 1996, the ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language) National Standards, with their strong emphasis on culture in the World Language classroom, have brought about a necessary change in the discourse concerning the challenges teachers face with regard to incorporating culture into their lessons.  There continues to be, for example, a lack of consensus among language instructors on what culture to teach and how to assess it.  This academic work addresses these questions, as well as offers potential solutions.      In addition to the aforementioned concepts, I discuss the need to confront negative stereotypes and ethnocentric behavior in the classroom.  In terms of secondary Italian classes in the United States, much of the work lies in addressing the depiction of Italian-Americans, by the mass media, as either criminals or half-witted narcissists.  Furthermore, I have considered a number of issues regarding linguistic sensitivity and, in particular, the dichotomy of language versus dialects within the Italian paradigm.           Film, music and visual art serve as the backdrop for the practical portion of this dissertation.  In these final sections, I provide strategies for the integration of culture into the secondary Italian curriculum by means of communicative activities.  It is the underlying conviction of this study, that these strategies will enable the student of Italian to simultaneously improve proficiency in the language, and attain greater cultural awareness and sensitivity.",0

The enhancement of musical and other learning for both teachers and students through a weekly choir session,"Primary schools are such busy demanding places. Educators are concerned with a crowded curriculum and high emphasis placed on the development and cultivation of literacy and numeracy concepts. Teachers are generally concerned with the delivery and teaching expectations of all key learning areas of the primary school curriculum. However, the creative arts, in the real world of time and teaching are generally speaking, lower in priority. The majority of teachers believe their teaching time is dominated by attention to English and mathematics because the demands of departmental directives necessitate that students achieve benchmark standards in literacy and numeracy and this has had direct consequences for the creative arts key learning area. This individual small-scale study provides further insights into the impact of the arts, in particular the impact of singing, in one Australian primary school. This paper will present investigation through a small scale study, into how the benefits associated with the inclusion of children singing in a one hour weekly session, can not only influence and enhance students' musical learning, but also develop and enhance teachers' personal skill and confidence levels, while promoting other learning for all concerned across key learning areas.

An evaluation of how the arts facilitate language acquisition through multisensory modalities,"The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to investigate the relationship between several arts modalities and language acquisition. The foundation of the study was how students acquire language through visual, auditory, aural, and kinetic modalities. The following art modalities were examined: (a) visuals and (tactile) manipulatives, (b) visuals and kinetics, and (c) music (auditory) and kinetics, as perceived by general education (GE) and English Language Learner (ELL) students. One hundred seventeen New York City public school students were surveyed. ELL and GE students from two high schools and two junior high schools who had varying levels of art experience and language acquisition skills participated. The students represented multiethnic backgrounds, genders, and lower socioeconomic levels, with high Latino representation at the secondary level. Data were collected using the student interest inventory and three experimental pretests and posttests over a six-week period. The researcher conducted interviews with four volunteering students and observed four classrooms. The experimental findings revealed no significant connections between the artistic modalities and language acquisition for either ELLs or GE students. If the sample size had been sufficient, trends found in the data might have attained significance. The interviews and class observations showed students using all the modalities. The interviewed students believed the various modalities helped their English learning, especially when multiple modalities were combined, as for example in a film. This result suggests that ELL teachers should be encouraged to use artistic modalities more consciously and deliberately than is currently the case.",0
Preschool English language learners with disabilities: A comparison of recommended and actual language of instruction practices,"This study investigated, through survey methodology, the instructional practices of teachers of English Language Learners (ELLs) with disabilities in Preschool Programs for Children with Disabilities (PPCD). These practices were compared to best-practice recommendations made by a group of evaluators in the field of bilingual special education. Results indicated that teacher practices differed considerably from recommendations made by expert evaluators in the field. Specifically, teachers preferred English as the exclusive language of instruction while expert evaluators strongly recommended bilingual instruction. Also, teachers reported strong administrator support while expert evaluators did not. Furthermore, most teachers reported satisfaction with the instruction of ELLs in their schools while most expert evaluators reported dissatisfaction. Results also showed that when administrators at Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings encouraged discussion about language of instruction, the likelihood of parent participation in these discussions increased. Language dominance and language proficiency testing of preschool aged ELLs, and representation of LPAC members at IEP meetings were major predictors of whether or not these children would receive referral to the bilingual or ESL programs in the future. Most of the results found in this study supported results found by Mueller, Singer, and Carranza in 2006. This study highlights research favoring the development of the primary language of ELLs in PPCD and Pre-K settings while underscoring the disconnect among teachers’ beliefs, training, and instructional practices.",0
Literature as language and language as culture: The implications for literature in language teaching,"[...]the book has a strong bias towards university teaching and, for that context, shows how the place of language within literature studies is made clear when stylistic analysis is introduced into the classroom.     Text analysis is foregrounded in most of the nine papers in these sections but they otherwise show little uniformity except in length.     [...]some contributors focus on individual language items, standard (e.g. David Gugin on pseudo-clefts) and non-standard (e.g. Paul Simpson on Hiberno-English emphatic tags), others on textual features (e.g. John McRae on narrative voice) others on interpretive frameworks (e.g. Judit Zerkowitz on Grice's Maxims), and still others explore ways in which teaching contexts can be improved during the implementation of a stylistics agenda (e.g. Mick Short, Beatrix Busse & Patricia Plumer on web-based teaching).     Perhaps surprisingly, several of the papers included by Paran report the innovative work of foreign language specialists in universities, a context in which Hall finds that 'literature is typically used in more traditional ways' (p. 47).     [...]Stuart McNicholls explains how a course on children's literature builds up both the linguistic and literary competence of trainee English teachers in Spain through work with chants, picture books, fairy tales and contemporary stories; Ian Butler, who follows Carter in treating literature as discourse, describes the positive effect of using inner and outer circle, literary and non-literary texts in ESL classes at a university in South Africa; and Gordon, Zaleski & Goodman, show how teachers can be trained to help ESL learners to bridge the cultural gap which may separate them from the new communities into which they have moved, by encouraging them to reflect on autobiographical narratives relevant to their experience.     [...]as will have been apparent throughout this review, Carter's latest study of linguistic creativity, although not necessarily of direct value to language teachers, makes an impressive and enlightening addition to his list of publications on this theme and is likely to provide additional impetus for those who wish to integrate the study of literary and non-literary texts.",0
Review article: Second language acquisition welcomes the heritage language learner: opportunities of a new field,"[...]Language Research 24,4 (2008); pp. 487506 Silvina Montrul University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Received October 2007; revised January 2008; accepted January 2008 Keywords: second language acquisition, heritage speakers, bilingualism, L1 loss, incomplete acquisition, language maintenance, language identity With increasing recent changes in immigration and demographic patterns, the face of the traditional second language (L2) classroom in Spanish and the less commonly taught languages has changed dramatically in the Western World.     Existing research on incipient or developing bilingualism in foreign or second languages is of little relevance to teachers of heritage students.     [...]views about second language (L2) developmental sequences and second language proficiency hierarchies can contribute little to the understanding of the instructional needs of this population.     Yet, gender errors are manifested differently: heritage speakers made more errors than L2 learners in the written tasks, whereas the L2 learners were less accurate on an oral task, which was assumed to minimize metalinguistic knowledge.     [...]the picture that is emerging thus far is that heritage speakers 1 I agree with an anonymous Second Language Research reviewer that age here is not just biological age but a macro-variable that also subsumes maturational state, cognitive development, degree of L1 proficiency, amount of L1 and L2 use, etc.     [...]although there is some basic research that systematically compares L2 learners and heritage speakers as well as research focusing on the systematic nature of incompletely acquired L1 grammatical systems in children and adults (Silva-Corvaln, 1994; 2003; Hkansson, 1995; Song et al., 1997; Anderson, 1999; Montrul, 2002; 2004; Kondo-Brown, 2005; Polinsky, 2006; 2008; Bolonyai, 2007) this trend should continue.",0

"Environmental Education Curriculum in a Bilingual Education School in China: a Journal for Readers, Students and Teachers of History","Many of the motives for starting immersion programs in public elementary and secondary schools in Qingdao City were similar to the reasons North American educators had for introducing bilingual education courses of study in their own schools.  Professor Hong De Jiang, the director of an immersion program in China, was frustrated that despite having six to twelve years of English language learning, the English oral proficiency of high school graduates was lagging behind their reading and writing skills (1995).  study incorporated scientific concepts such as red tides, acid rain, sandstorms, endangered wild animals, and ecological balance with English language forms of narrative art, dance, drama, music, and poetry.",0
"The effects of age, gender and language on children's singing competency","Literature on children's singing development is largely skewed towards findings based on English-speaking children. The present study aims to fill the gap in research through an investigation of the effects of age, gender and language on the singing competency of Cantonese-speaking children. One hundred and twenty children aged 7 and 9 years participated in the study. Sixty children were Cantonese monolinguals and 60 were English bilinguals. Each child performed individually a criterion song and two independent judges rated the recorded singing performance. Welch's model of Pitch-matching Development (2000) and Rutkowski's Singing Voice Development Measure (1998) were used to evaluate singing competency. Results suggest that melodic singing achievement and the ability to use a singing voice are moderately related singing behaviours. Evidence also suggests that gender and language but not age affects singing competency. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0

Publications received,"The Third Conference of the Central European Region of Fdration Internationale des Professeurs de Langues Vivantes was held in the Council-of-Europe-sponsored International Year of Languages and provided a forum for European (and Australian!) linguists, language teachers and other language professionals to debate policy making, intercultural communication, language teaching methods and technology, and recent European language projects.     Drawing on the history of foreign language teaching, ethnography, developmental psychology, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, and on empirical and theoretical studies, the author makes a case for the use of music and song as a powerful component of the language-teaching curriculum, especially in the classroom with younger and older children, regardless of the overall method of language teaching employed.     The author presents the rationale for and research surrounding the development of DIALANG, a suite of internet-delivered diagnostic foreign language tests funded by the European Commission in the years 19962004, a project which covers fourteen European languages and ve main areas of language prociency: reading, listening, writing, grammar and vocabulary.",0
Information age or age of amnesia?,"I'm writing this on the eve of Remembrance Day in the Year of the Veteran. I am seized by the moment to think about the act of remembering. I remember that last year on Remembrance Day, I was meeting with an informal German language conversation group. At 11 a.m. we held a two-minute silence. Then spontaneously, a senior member of the group, in somewhat accented English, recited all verses of ""In Flanders Fields"" so flawlessly and so movingly that it was hard to hold back the tears. There was such heartbreaking beauty and irony in that moment. I grew up with that poem and have always been moved by it. But I wouldn't be able to get beyond the first few lines without prompting and I wonder if either of my (now grown) children would do any better.     Long-term memory proficiency is not the same as a knack for ""cramming""-that well-known student capacity to memorize an entire course overnight, spew it out, and forget it by lunch. Longterm memory differs structurally from short-term memory. Recent scientific research has shown that the brain has a specific mechanism to transfer short-term memories into permanent storage. It appears to involve a system of replaying and reinforcing the same event to create the explicit connections that constitute long-term memory. Some researchers have even isolated a particular protein related to long-term memory functions. You can't force the activation of long-term memory with arbitrary rote memorization and mandatory recitation. There has to be some personal commitment to the process. Actors and musicians know about this. If you lose the flow during a performance you risk finding yourself at a mortifying dead stop before an assembled audience. The flow is achieved through constant, constant repetition over a long period of time. In fact the French word for rehearsal is exactly that-répétition. There is nothing fast about it. It is hard work and the motivation has to be there.     Educator and author Heather Menzies points out, in her recent book No Time, that citizens need good memory skills. You can't just google ""functioning democracy"" and expect to come up with the name of the best person or policy to vote for. ""Memory, or at least the retention of information, is crucial to...critical thinking, in both its aspects: The broad range of personal experience, chance observations and overheard chat, plus the deeper wells of accumulated and composted knowledge, wise nuggets and one-liners against which we test new information, sensing contradictions and resisting accepting the latest idea or news flash simply because it is new,"" says Menzies.2",0

Preschool Children's Pitch-Matching Accuracy in Relation to Participation in Cantonese-Immersion Preschools,"This study is an investigation of the degree to which preschool children enrolled in Cantonese-immersion preschools in three areas of the United States differed from their monolingual counterparts in pitch-matching accuracy. In a 2003 study, I found that in monolingual American English-speaking children, pitch-matching accuracy was most significantly predicted by the mean speech frequency of the voice, speech range, and age. In the present study, 20 children from the first study were matched solely by age and sex to 20 immersion children (N = 40). Results indicated that participation in the Cantonese-immersion programs most significantly affected overall pitch-matching accuracy (p < .001), with age as the strongest predictor of singing the lower notes in the study (p = .04). Implications of these findings in relation to physiological vocal development and vocal use are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
Cutting Edge Art Showcased at MDC,"Miami Dade College (MDC) is a two-year, state-supported school that enrolls more Hispanic students than any other college or university in the United States. After the Don Johnsonization of the South Florida city in the '80s, MDC's cultural affairs department sped out of the Reagan years by developing the Cultura del Lobo Performance Series in 1990. Named jokingly after the College's Wolfson campus (lobo meaning ""wolf"" in Spanish), the performance series aims to ""explore the space between tradition and innovation,"" and to provide performances within artist residencies that offer master classes, symposia, demonstrations, or workshops for the student body and the larger Miami community.     First Lady Laura Bush spoke at the 2004 commencement, and offered these words about the institution: ""Miami Dade College forms a strong link between two of our nation's top priorities -- education and employment. Colleges and universities bridge the gap between people's lives as they are and their lives as they want them to be."" She continued, noting the great diversity on the campus, ""And as that beautiful flag ceremony just showed us, you call nearly 80 countries home. But no matter where you were born or what you've done until now, today you emerge as a graduate -- and as a different person. You emerge with the skills and the values to make a difference in your lives and in your community."" And that's precisely what Miami Dade College aims to accomplish through the global perspective of its arts and culture programs.     As part of MDC's commitment to enriching greater Miami, the arts and philosophy department's Prometeo Theater Company offers Spanish-language theater classes for acting, dance and music. Named in honor of Francisco Morin's Prometeo group front Cuba, and comprised of a largely Hispanic student body, Prometeo Theater explores styles of performance from classical productions to street theater. The award-winning troupe, in residence on the Wolfson campus, hosts a bilingual summer camp for children. From June 21 through Aug. 13, 2004, kids can take classes in English and Spanish that culminate in a different performance each week. Classic children's shows such as ""Cinderella"" and ""The Three Pigs,"" and not-so-classic shows such as ""The Enchanted Shrimp,"" help preserve Hispanic culture and the Spanish language.",0
In praise of Canadian contradictions: making our way in a globalized world,"In fact, the cultural similarities Canadians (especially English-speaking Canadians) share with the United States has been one of the grounds of mainstream Canadian cultural success. Alanis Morrisette, Avril Lavigne, and Jim Carrey are often mistaken as Americans unless a proud Canuck pipes up pointing out the mistake. Popular Canadian cultural production has, for some time, 'piggy-backed' on the American form and has enjoyed considerable success doing so. This is not to say that a more uniquely Canadian culture has not achieved world renown on its own merit. In the field of literature, Canadians have quietly asserted themselves as some of the best contemporary writers in the English and French languages. Canadian writers took half of the nominations and eventually the prestigious Booker Prize in 2002, as Yann Martel beat out Rohinton Mistry and Carol Shields. Mistry, a former Booker Prize winner for A Fine Balance, is an excellent example of modern Canadian writing. Mistry sets most of his writing in the India of the 1970s, but admits the influence Canada has had in forming his view of the world. Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Anne Hebert, Alice Munro, and Michel Tremblay round out the well-respected stable of writers Canada has produced. In another interesting cultural development, second-generation Canadians are getting into the act in the movie and music industries, as they return to their parents' lands of origin, and often bring with them a unique perspective or talent as result of the Canadian mix. A great example of this new and exciting trend can be seen in Deepa Mehta's Bollywood/Hollywood that stars Canadian Lisa Ray, who has become a huge name in Indian film.     Canadians generally understand that they live securely with a level of material wealth that remains only a dream for the majority of the world. Knowing that we live well informs Canadians' concern for the problems we see in the world; this is reflected in the Canadian government's involvement in humanitarian activities with landmines, AIDS, and peacekeeping operations. The 2002 Pew Global Attitude Survey interviewed over 30,000 people from around the world and revealed that Canadians exhibited the lowest levels of concern about crime and ethnic unrest, and that Canada was the only country in the West where the majority of the population (56%) expressed satisfaction with the state of their country.(1) In the same survey, Canadians identified spreading ethnic hatred in the world and the degradation of the environment as the greatest dangers to the world.     The second reason for Canadian success is classically Canadian. Official multiculturalism encourages Canadians of non-French, non-English background to nurture and celebrate their heritage as an important part of the Canadian mosaic. Paradoxically, this policy, designed to nurture and maintain difference, has worked to more deeply and quickly integrate newcomers. In many European countries, where assimilation is strongly encouraged, the opposite occurs, as newcomers feel that they are not fully respected or treated as equals. Immigrants respond by holding on to their culture and language and by passing it on to their children as a defensive measure against assimilation. In less open and flexible societies, like France and Germany, few citizens have adopted the viewpoint that an African or Asian immigrant could be 'French' or 'German'. This pressure to assimilate, coupled with an unwelcoming attitude, can quickly turn enthusiasm to bitterness. Friends who were immigrants in Europe and have now settled in Canada underwent an interesting transformation after they arrived. Told that they should hold onto their culture, they slowly let it slip as they grew into their new country. They excuse the fact that their children do not speak their parents' language or follow the culture of their home country, because ""Canada is now their home.""",0
"ONE MAN, TWO LANGUAGES; Confessions of a freedom-loving bilingual: Journal of American Indian Higher Education","Furthermore, Cheyenne is the language of our hallowed ancestors, our sacred rituals, our spiritualism, and our humor. It holds within it the respectful way I approach other people; the awed manner in which I say the place names of our sacred sites, like Noavose (our holy mountain near Sturgis, SD); and the reverential way in which I talk to the creator. It contains the holy, serious, and humorous ways with which I interact with all people. Cheyenne is a language laden with laughter. My language gives me the psychological and emotional support to pursue my dreams. I do all this with my Cheyenne language.              I am taking this opportunity to write about these multi-layered aspects of my language because I want children and non-speakers of the Cheyenne language to understand the metaphysical and metacognitive aspects of speaking another language. A bilingual person does not neatly dichotomize each language into separate compartments, nor are the languages automatically adversarial. The Cheyenne and English languages complement each other wonderfully. Speaking, reading, writing, and thinking in Cheyenne make me whole and enhance my life spiritually and intellectually. English enables me to make a living in the non-Cheyenne, English speaking society and similarly enhances me spiritually and intellectually.              Both the Cheyenne and English languages have helped to form who I am, for good or bad. Both languages have helped me to achieve a modicum of success in the ""white man's"" world. Beyond the languages' utility, I take pleasure in reading, writing, and thinking in both languages. I like reading and hearing the soaring words of Martin Luther King, Jr., the solemn phraseology of the Lake Poets, the majesty and wit of Shakespeare, the whimsicality of Ogden Nash, and the inspiring obscurity of Dylan Thomas. I enjoy hearing the Cheyenne lyrics and vocatives of our honor and flag songs. I like hearing the rhythmic, precise terminology of Cheyenne prayers. For me, both languages have equal weight and influence in all that I do.",0

Periodically,"""Show respect,"" explains [Carlos R. Abril]. ""First and foremost, we must demonstrate sincere respect and a genuine desire to assist ELL students. If children are not respected as individuals and treated equally among their peers, they may feel ostracized, and their academic achievement will most likely suffer."" The author draws this conclusion from Sonia Nieto's book Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education. Abril places sensitivity to the ""unique social and academic challenges these individuals encounter,"" as the next most important factor. He explains, ""Regardless of whether your school has a large or minuscule population of Hispanic students, these students face certain challenges specific to their situation."" This also includes, he suggests, finding out more about your students' country of origin, heritage, and experience with music.     A gesture can speak volumes to students unable to grasp English in your classroom. Hand signs or gestures, which are routinely used in music classrooms, can build strong bridges to vocabulary useful inside and outside the classroom. The author explains, ""Most music educators already use such signs, albeit for musical objectives. We use Curwen hand signs when teaching solfège and conducting gestures to evoke expressive singing or playing. While results may not be immediate or apparent, research suggests that hand signals used in connection with a word or concept improve ELL children's ability to use and understand vocabulary."" The author rites Journal of Music's ""The Effect of Singing Paired with Signing on Receptive Vocabulary Skills of Elementary ESL Students"" by Heather A. Schunk as the basis of his conclusion.",0
"The Status of Literature in Six Types of Trinidad Secondary Schools: Issues, Implications, and Recommendations","A survey of teachers' perspectives on the status of literature in Trinidadian secondary schools suggest that the subject is dying. Teachers cite problems with reading, critical thinking, and students' lack of interest, singling out poetry as an area of little competence. Current deficiencies in teachng strategies suggest that teachers need to approach the language arts, on the whole, as a field of knowledge, amenable to requiring scientific methods of approach, which teachers must perfect. A comparative survey of students suggests that teachers need to take into consideration the allure that technology holds for young people in planning their lessons. They also need to be aware that the secondary school population in Trinidad and Tobago is not homogenous, and requires varied strategies and teaching approaches to woo its varied cultures. Further recommendations of this paper include: (a) the training of secondary school teachers of English in the teaching of reading and remedial reading strategies, and (b) a focus on literature in all its genres, including non-fiction, especially for the upper levels of public secondary schools, and particularly to attract boys. It is felt that these policies, together, will promote a culture that will offset the literacy problems that affect schools, as well as enhance the preparation for adulthood that schooling offers.",0

SUCCESS STORIES: GED at San Joaquin Delta College; Moves Thousands in Right Direction,"The GED full- and part-time staff are aware of the self-esteem issues that students bring into the classroom. Some students enter the program with low self-confidence, a poor self-image, lack of motivation, poor academic and social skills, etc. To meet their need for self-esteem, a yearly graduation ceremony is conducted at the close of each spring semester for all GED graduates. The annual graduation ceremony has been held for the last eight years, since the inception of the program. Those who attend the ceremony walk to the music of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" through an audience consisting of family and friends, members of the San Joaquin Delta Board of Trustees, the college president, the vice president of instruction, the vice president of student services, the program administrators, faculty, staff recruiters, and support staff. Key individuals from the greater San Joaquin County and the greater Stockton vicinity are invited as special guests. Delta's president usually opens the ceremony with a welcome address. Two student speakers represent all students -- one speaking in English, the other in Spanish -- and deliver inspirational messages to their classmates and the audience. Scholarships are awarded to a select group of students; an individual is recognized for having the highest GED scores. Those students graduating with honors (250 points or more) are recognized and do not wear the black Delta tassel; instead, they wear the gold ""honors"" tassel. A speaker from the general community or campus community usually delivers a message to the students. It is a special night for GED graduates and their families.     Herman Ambriz, an aspiring artist, says that he wishes his high school experience could have been as positive as his experience in Mr. [Ramirez]'s classroom. ""I wish there would have been teachers in my high school who listen to you like Mr. Ramirez. There should be more teachers who take the time."" Ambriz, who obtained his GED in May 1999, in a ceremony held yearly in the Atherton Auditorium at Delta, has plans to become a graphic artist and start a business. ""If I can overcome some obstacles, I know I can reach my goals,"" he says. ""I have two jobs, one with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, and another with his daughter, Dea Spanos Berberian. I'm doing maintenance work, and I work with a cook as an assistant. It's a big start, and I think Spanos is just starting me up. I even have two cars, and I'm going forward with my art and poetry,"" a jubilant Ambriz said.",0
Reflections on standards and standard setting: An insider/outsider perspective on the NCTE/IRA standards,"Since fewer than half of all high school 'graduates' now get 'Regents' diplomas-the number is about 20% in New York City-the next five years promise to be a fascinating study in the politics of testing since at least so far there is no evidence that teachers will be given additional support to help develop the curricula or the methods needed to make these expectations a reality.     Partly in response to our response and partly independently, the three constituent bodies of the Council whose executive committees met in Minneapolisthe Elementary and Secondary Sections and the Conference on English Education-were unanimous in repudiating the `consensus draft' and the public forums were consistently negative.     Since these constituencies were the ones directly concerned with these K-12 standards, it was clear by the end of the Minneapolis conference that this version was doomed and, indeed, they were never distributed broadly within either organization.     What we came to believe was that: * the standards had to be rooted in a commitment to equity of resources for all students; * the standards had to be integrated with each other, not a series of stand alone statements; * the standards had to explain why students needed to be proficient users of language as well as how well they should be able to use language; * the standards had to be developmental so that growth from the beginning of schooling to high school graduation could be charted; * the standards had to be defined across six language arts: viewing and visually representing (which we called mediacy) as well as the more traditional reading, writing, speaking, and listening; * the standards were not to define the content of the English language arts curriculum, but were, instead to serve as a conceptual framework within which curricula could be built and tests and assessment systems developed.     [...]a few organizations who had been marginalized like art and music, or absorbed in the great amalgamations of social studies, like geography and even history, have used the standards writing process as a way of renewing and redefining a place in the curricular sun.) Whether or not anyone can completely leave behind their disciplinary epistemology is doubtful, of course, but a group that was charged to look across the disciplines and which included some of the traditional foundational perspectives-philosophers, historians, sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists-might have conceived their task quite differently and therefore written standards more like those Michael and I wrote than like those the subject matter organizations came up with.",0
Letters,"[...]as a mainstream high school English teacher, I find myself with state mandates, de-tracked classes, district curricula, classes of 30+, a wider variant of ESL students in my three ""Regular"" 10th grade sections and two Honors sections, and limited resources for their assistance.     Janet Lueck Streamwood High School, Illinois ""The School Administrator"" Reading my latest [December 1996] issue of EJ has left me feeling rather disappointed with your lack of taste in publishing such an inflammatory piece of writing aimed at so many in an educational career.

Hawaiian Goes Home: The University of Hawai'i Helps Return the Traditional Language of the Islands to Everyday Use: Journal of American Indian Higher Education,"The UH-Hilo Hawaiian Studies Department also pioneered the raising of children in Hawaiian at the home. The children of the department's original two faculty members, now aged ten and eight, were the first children raised in a totally Hawaiian speaking home by second language speakers and also among the first P...nana [Leo] students. There are now ten families using Hawaiian as the primary language of the home. In many other families, parents and older siblings of children in Hawaiian medium schools are learning Hawaiian and using some of the language at home. Grandparents also play an important role in reinforcing Hawaiian with Hawaiian medium school children.              All department courses at the 300-level and higher are taught through Hawaiian, as are some experiential-type courses at lower levels. Among topics covered in these Hawaiian medium courses are: Hawaiian literature, localized Hawaiian traditions, traditional Hawaiian chant, modern Hawaiian music, traditional Hawaiian dance, modern Hawaiian dance, Hawaiian poetry, Hawaiian phonetics and phonology, Hawaiian morphology and syntax, the relationship of Hawaiian to other Polynesian languages, the translation of English material into Hawaiian, and traditional handcrafts and medicine.              Students beyond the first year also use Hawaiian by interacting with elders once a week in conversation groups that substitute for listening to tapes in a language laboratory. Students are encouraged to speak Hawaiian among themselves outside class and at program parties and excursions. Many students use Hawaiian as the language of communication in part-time jobs. The local P...nana Leo preschool and elementary school Papa Kaiapuni Hawai'i Program hire UH-Hilo students as educational aides. Others work in developing Hawaiian language materials for these schools and the Ni'ihau community through the University's Hale Kuamo'o Hawaiian language center where Hawaiian is the language of communication on the job. Still others work with Hawaiian as a second language programs in local English medium elementary schools, high schools, night schools, and P...nana Leo parent centers.",0
The @Filosoclips project: teaching feminist philosophy through popular culture in Spain,"This paper outlines the results of the multimodal education project @Filosoclips, carried out during the 2017/2018 academic year in the Faculty of Education at Universidad de Málaga with students aged 16 and 17. The purpose of this project was to test the possibility of introducing texts by feminist thinkers into the official curriculum of the Philosophy course offered in Spain’s Compulsory Secondary Education and Baccalaureate programmes. The project constituted an educational innovation with students in the first year of the Spanish Baccalaureate programme, focusing on three basic objectives: to experiment with the addition to the high school reading curriculum of texts typically included in feminist studies; to give visibility to female philosophers in the Philosophy curriculum; and to conduct a practical trial in the classroom of the use of popular culture (music videos, in this case) as an instrument for developing critical thinking skills. Notable among the results of the project was the recognition of the importance for female students of incorporating major women philosophers and exploring topics that directly affect them in their everyday lives, such as the International Women’s Day marches across Spain on 8 March.",0
"Language use, home literacy environment, and demography: Predicting vocabulary skills among diverse young dual language learners in Norway","From a socio-cultural perspective, language offers a means for children to communicate with and learn from others through interaction: language is the medium through which young children are provided cognitive, social, and emotional support in interactions with caregivers, siblings, and peers; and children characterized as dual language learners (DLLs) have in common that they receive this developmental support in two different languages. However, due to variations in socioeconomic factors, ethnic/immigration background, and language socialization practices, DLLs display considerable variability in their first- and second-language proficiency (McCabe, Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein, Cates, Golinkoff, Guerra, Hirsh-Pasek, Hoff, Kuchirko, Melzi, Mendelsohn, Páez & Song, 2013).",0
Spatial Metaphor Facilitates Word Learning,"Why are spatial metaphors, like the use of “high” to describe a musical pitch, so common? This study tested one hundred and fifty‐four 3‐ to 5‐year‐old English‐learning children on their ability to learn a novel adjective in the domain of space or pitch and to extend this adjective to the untrained dimension. Children were more proficient at learning the word when it described a spatial attribute compared to pitch. However, once children learned the word, they extended it to the untrained dimension without feedback. Thus, children leveraged preexisting associations between space and pitch to spontaneously understand new metaphors. These results suggest that spatial metaphors may be common across languages in part because they scaffold children’s acquisition of word meanings that are otherwise difficult to learn.",0
FROM THE EDITORS,"The articles we selected for the issue demonstrate the commitment English teachers have to provide opportunities for students to appreciate the art of poetry and to develop personal, important connections to the genre, to individual poems, and to poets whose work they will want to return to often.     Singer/songwriter Melissa Talhelm describes how she has used traditional song forms to hone students' critical analysis skills, and Kimberly Athans explains how she has adapted the roles typically played by students participating in literature circle discussions for small-group conversations about poems and poetry.     The issue concludes with award-winning young adult author Laura Resau's meditation on a wooden box her grandfather made and her experiences in high school English classes, when she often felt that she had to ""separate her literary soul from school,"" but also where she was introduced to poems such as ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" and ""maggie and milly and molly and may"" that entranced her, spoke to her spirit, and inspired her to write.",0
FROM THE EDITORS,"In this issue, teachers and teacher educators share the melodies, musicals, popular music, hiphop, rap, spoken word, and sounds that complement language arts education in our classrooms.     During the COVID-19 pandemic, we gain more insights on how teachers and leaders can support student learning and family literacy.     [...]our language arts classrooms can welcome their sounds and expressions more deliberately as they create, edit, revise, play, and perform.     May the sounds of music that our students bring into our classrooms continue to inform and enlighten us. 0] R.

"Who Came First, the Lion or the Bear? The Translation and Rendition of <i>We're Going on a Bear Hunt</i> into Spanish","This article examines the elements that have influenced the thirty years of commercial success of the book We're Going on a Bear Hunt (originally published in 1989; Rosen and Oxenbury) and considers it a contemporary example of a historical trend: the transformation of oral texts into publications. Focusing on the textual mode in the picturebook, this example additionally illustrates the complication of defining a text, and questions whether the source text of a translation can be identified when several versions coexist. A textual analysis of the Spanish-published translation Vamos a Cazar un Oso and a musical analysis and qualitative survey of the use of Spanish in the oral rendition ""Voy en Busca de un León"" illustrate four different elements entailed in the translation of a children's rhyme: the semantic content (vocabulary and story line), the linguistic structure (verse forms and prosody), the musical or rhythmical foundation, and the element of play or movement.",0

The following task frame and student learning outcome establish a purpose for viewing Mon précieux, and communicate to students what they will be able to do as a result of working with the music video and other related materials: [End Page 36] Learning Target: I can argue for or against cell phones and social media.     In a virtual format, students watch the video independently and can complete the graphic organizer in a number of different ways: they can fill it out by hand and take a photo to submit their work; the teacher can prepare a GoogleForm for students to input their responses; or students could complete the graphic organizer online using a platform such as GoogleClassroom or Seesaw.",0
Social Media and Internet Use Patterns by Adolescents With Complex Communication Needs,"Purpose: Nearly all students use Internet-based social media to communicate and network. For those with complex communication needs who may benefit from augmentative and alternative communication, social media offer specific opportunities to participate. However, do students make use of them-or do they face new barriers? The aim of the study was to collect data on the types, frequency, and duration of Internet and social media use among students with complex communication needs, along with the barriers to and facilitators of use, and to compare their use with peers without disabilities. Method: Twenty-four German secondary school students with complex communication needs and motor difficulties were surveyed by a questionnaire based on an Australian study. Results: A majority (75%) of the participants used the Internet, with most using daily and on more than one device. Use for school activities played only a minor role. Instead, the Internet was most often used for recreational activities (e.g., listening to music, watching videos), followed by communication by e-mail or chat, and lastly for seeking information. Greater Internet use was desired by 88% of the participants. The data show technical and social difficulties in Internet access and use and indicate that literacy skills and motor skills influence the Internet use. Conclusion: School education should address the desire for greater Internet use. The teaching of media literacy and the provision of appropriate assistive and/or mainstream technology are therefore needed. More research is required on how persons with complex communication needs can potentially and actually benefit from the use of social media and on how teaching how to use social media can lead to further digital and social participation.",0
Why I fell in love with mini whiteboards,"Tes asks convert Emily Gunton How do you provide quick feedback, check work and work through misunderstandings from two metres away?     The director of music, head of co-curricular and outreach and school consultant teacher at Blackheath High School, in south-east London, has trialled various options. o, are mini whiteboards well-established in schools now? ving spoken to colleagues within my own school and across a variety of other schools, the mini whiteboards have taken root, although their use does appear to tail off in the older years and they tend to appeal to maths and the sciences more than English and the humanities. so, they do appear to be like Marmite: you either love them or hate them.     Most importantly, it gives our students a sense of freedom, particularly my students with special educational needs and disabilities. d after years of battling with notebooks, booklets and folders, I have improved my environmental impact and have come to rely on my whiteboards.",0
"Can we measure musically active people’s music skills and achievement self-concept? Structure and invariance of CAMU, a Spanish questionnaire","Music self-concept measurement tools are essential at all music educational levels in all contexts. Until now, the lack of a validated music self-concept questionnaire in Spanish-speaking countries has been noticeable. The aim of this study is to validate the Musical Self-Concept Questionnaire (CAMU) (Zubeldia, M. 2015. El autoconcepto musical, motivación y bienestar psicológico del alumnado de conservatorio [Musical self-concept, motivation and psychological well-being of conservatory students]. Doctoral thesis. Leioa: UPV-EHU), which is an abbreviated and culturally adapted Spanish language version of the Music Self-Perception Inventory (MUSPI), developed by Vispoel (1993a. The Music Self-Perception Inventory (Adolescent Form). Iowa: Author, 1993b. The Music Self-Perception Inventory (Adult/College Form). Iowa: Author). Participants comprised 407 students from mid-level music studies from conservatories located in different autonomous regions of Spain. The confirmatory factor analysis supports the hierarchical view of the music self-concept. Furthermore, the study also tests the scalar invariance across gender-differentiated subgroups, which is a prerequisite to compare factor mean differences between groups. This is the final step in the validation of the CAMU, which enables cross-cultural research into this construct. The educational implications for music students are discussed.",0
"STREAM Education at Work-No, at Play!","The children's teacher, Ms. Rodgers, uses an interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasizes STEM, literacy, and social and emotional learning, along with addressing art, music, and other areas of development.     A result of many years of research and classroom testing funded by the National Science Foundation, Connect4Learning (Sarama et al. 2016) was designed to address growing concerns that the majority of pre-K instructional time is devoted to one or two subject areas rather than attending to all domains of early learning, including science, technology, engineering, and math.     [...]early achievement in math and science predicts later school success, including later language and reading competencies, as well as or better than early literacy skills do (Duncan et al. 2007; Lerkkanen et al. 2005; Peterson and French 2008).     In the art center, children were inspired by this story and an assortment of loose parts and recycled objects to create their own masterpieces, building tower structures on which to glue a variety of small objects and decorations.",0
Nurturing Infants and Toddlers with Diverse Language Experiences,"Eight-month-old Anka is having trouble settling in to her second week at the child care center. Miriam, her care specialist, does not speak Gujarati (a language spoken in India), which is the language Anka is used to hearing at home. As Miriam tries singing some soothing songs in English to no avail, another child's mother walks by and casually remarks, ""It doesn't matter what language you sing. She's not even talking yet!"" Miriam opens her phone and brings up a recording of Anka's mother singing a traditional song and plays it while holding and rocking Anka. Miriam begins to sing along, imitating the words as she gets familiar with the tune. As Anka relaxes and starts to smile, Miriam feels confident that her efforts to support connections with Anka's home language are making a difference.",0
Zur Situation des Musikunterrichts an den Grundschulen und zum zukünft igen Musiklehrkräft ebedarf und -angebot,"Im Auftrag des Deutschen Musikrats und der Konferenz der Landesmusikräte wurde eine Studie zum Musikunterricht in der Grundschule durchgeführt, über deren zentrale Ergebnisse berichtet wird. Die einleitende Situationsanalyse berichtet über die unterschiedlichen Vorgaben zwischen den Ländern zum Musikunterricht und die Umsetzung dieser Vorgaben insbesondere mit Blick auf den fachfremd erteilten Unterricht. Die anschließenden Überlegungen zum zukünftigen Bedarf an Musiklehrkräften berücksichtigen den Bestand, die voraussichtlich aus Altersgründen ausscheidenden Lehrkräfte und den Bestand an jungen Musiklehrkräften unter 35 Jahren, die Schülerzahlenentwicklung, die Zahl der Absolvent·innen mit einer Zweiten Lehramtsprüfung in Musik im letzten Jahrzehnt, die Zahl der Studienanfänger·innen mit dem Fach Musik für die Grundschule und die Seiteneinstiege mit dem Fach Musik für die Grundschule. Mit diesen Informationen werden Modellrechnungen zum voraussichtlichen Bestand an Musiklehrkräften 2028 durchgeführt, die absehbaren Konsequenzen für den Musik unterricht und zu ergreifende Maßnahmen beschrieben.Alternate abstract:The German Music Council and Federal State Music Councils commissioned a study on music education at primary schools in Germany, and central findings are reported here. The introductory analysis of the situation informs about different stipulations across federal states regarding music education and their implementation, particularly with respect to instruction by non-skilled teachers. The following considerations concerning the future need for trained music teachers take the situation into account, i.e., the teachers due to retire as well as the number of teachers aged under 35 years, together with the development of primary school population figures, the number of music teaching graduates with a second level state exam in the past decade, the number of students enrolled in music teaching at primary school level, and the number of career changers who opt for teaching music at primary school level. This information is used for model calculations on the prospective number of music teachers in 2028. Possible consequences for music education are described as well as measures that need to be taken.",0
Playing a musical instrument 'key to academic success': References,"Schools should resist putting additional time and resources into yet more English and maths lessons and instead give children's learning a research-evidenced boost by encouraging them to join a band or an orchestra, says Martin Leigh Bandura, A (2006) ""Toward a psychology of human agency"", Perspectives on Psychological Science, 1/2: 164-180 Daubney, A, Spruce, G and Annetts, D (2019) Music Education: State of the Nation (All Party Parliamentary Group for Music Education, University of Sussex, Incorporated Society of Musicians) Diamond A (2013) ""Executive functions"", Annual Review of Psychology, 64: 135-168 Guhn, M, Emerson, S D and Gouzouasis, P (2019) ""A population-level analysis of associations between school music participation and academic achievement"", Journal of Educational Psychology Hallam, S (2010) ""The power of music: its impact on the intellectual, social and personal development of children and young people"", International Journal of Music Education, 28: 269-289 Hattie, J (2012) Visible Learning for Teachers (Routledge) Kahneman, D (2011) Thinking, Fast and Slow (Penguin) Londesborough, M, Partridge, L, Bath, N and Grinsted, S (2017) Learning About Culture (RSA) Pitts, S (2012) Chances and Choices: exploring the impact of music education (Oxford University Press) See, B H and Kokotsaki, D (2015) Impact of Arts Education on the Cognitive and Non-cognitive Outcomes of School-aged Children: a review of evidence (Education Endowment Foundation and Durham University) Schellenberg, E G (2004) ""Music lessons enhance IQ"", Psychological Science, 15/8: 511-514 It is a truth universally acknowledged that playing an instrument helps children in many aspects of school life - well, at least in the fraternity of music teachers it is.     [...]recently, however, we have been in want of evidence to support our theory.     The recent report Music Education: State of the Nation describes dwindling secondary curriculum hours for music, fewer specialist music teachers and states, yet again, the damaging effects of the English Baccalaureate.     The study takes academic outcomes - mathematics and science achievement in the chosen cohort at the age of 15 or 16 (Canadian grade 10), as well as English achievement at both 15 or 16 and 17 or 18 - and compares them with involvement in music, instrumental and vocal, measured by the number of music classes taken.     Executive functioning The first is executive functioning, which incorporates a set of skills much like the slow, deliberate, logical modes of thinking found in Daniel Kahneman's System 2 (Kahneman, 2011) that support our ability to focus attention, our cognitive flexibility and our inhibition (self-regulation), and are also associated with efficiency in using short-term memory.",0
'An attempt to tip the scales': music and embodied capital in an English secondary school,"This article explores class, capital, and aspiration to social mobility in an ethnographic study of an English secondary school. In particular, the article considers the school's musical instrument programme as a site for inculcating forms of capital, under the auspices of developing skills for upward social mobility. Bringing together Bourdieu's conceptions of schooling with theories of materiality and situated learning, we contend that this school succeeds in cultivating new forms of embodied capital among students through the development of communities of musical practice. However, a tension remains between emancipatory aims of the programme and the sanctioning and championing of certain forms of dominant cultural practice. The learning environment of the instrument programme highlights the complex and conflicted impact that schooling can have on the development of cultural capital and on reproducing disadvantage and difference.",0

Perspectives on shared reading among a sample of Latino parents,"BackgroundPaediatric professionals promote shared reading to facilitate school readiness, yet relatively few studies examine how parents from underserved communities consider this issue in their daily lives. We sought to understand shared reading within the broader context of parenting among Latino parents.MethodsWe conducted in‐depth interviews, purposively sampling Spanish‐speaking, Latina mothers of children aged ≤3 years from an urban Federally Qualified Health Center. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed iteratively. We allowed themes to emerge from data rather than impose an a priori framework. We sought disconfirming evidence within interviews and collected additional data to ensure no new themes were identified (saturation).ResultsWe achieved saturation after 12 interviews. The median child age was 1.4 years. We identified four major themes: (a) All participants reported engaging in literacy promoting activities such as conversations, storytelling, play, and singing even if they did not read to their children daily. (b) Parents' attitudes regarding early learning and development influenced the extent to which parents engaged in shared reading with their child. (c) Participants described feelings that they ought to read daily with their children but were not and cited a variety of barriers. (d) Parents who engaged in frequent shared reading described it as a joyful and relaxed experience; parents who did not engage in shared reading described reading as instructing children or engaging in drills (e.g., teaching letters).ConclusionUrban, Latina mothers who did not read regularly with their children nonetheless recognized its importance suggesting that existing programmes have raised awareness even among underserved families. Refinement of messaging may be needed to move past raising awareness to facilitating shared reading for some parents.",0
"Teenagers, smartphones and digital audio consumption in the age of Spotify","The consolidation of smartphones as dominant devices for access to digital information and entertainment has redefined the processes of production and commercialization of cultural communication industries. The nature of these screens, which prioritize the visual content over the sound, decisively influences distribution strategies in the audio market: radio operators, streaming music platforms and podcast creators need to adapt their value chains to the habits derived from this mediation, especially in the younger audience. This research identifies the practices of mobile use as an audio receiver among adolescents in Colombia, Spain and Mexico -the most representative countries of Spanish-speaking digital sound consumption- based on a descriptive study on a thousand subjects from 13 to 19 years of age. The results confirm the overwhelming dominance in this music menu in the face of low penetration of radio and podcast word content. The selection is based on personal criteria, with little margin for the prescription of family or friends. There is evidence of the roots of individual listening, linked to the brand and the visibility of audio providers, who are obliged to develop diffusion logics based not only on thematic or genre preferences, but also on the user experience.Alternate abstract:La consolidación de los smartphones como dispositivos dominantes de acceso a la información y el ocio digital ha redefinido los procesos de producción y comercialización de las industrias culturales de la comunicación.

Esta investigación identifica las prácticas de uso del móvil como receptor de audio entre los adolescentes de Colombia, España y México -los países más representativos del consumo digital sonoro hispanohablante- a partir de un estudio descriptivo sobre 1.004 sujetos de 13 a 19 años. Los resultados revelan el abrumador dominio de la música en este menú frente a la baja aceptación de los contenidos de palabra de radio y podcast. Su selección se asienta sobre criterios personales, con poco margen para la prescripción de familiares o amigos.

The Effects of Music-Infused Instruction on Student Achievement in Secondary School Spanish,"Learning a second language (L2) benefits students personally, academically, and career-wise (American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2016; Auburn University, 2017; Cutshall, 2017). According to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), the average U.S. student studies an L2 for two years (2017a). To become proficient at an intermediate level, a student needs to study an L2 for more than four years (ACTFL, 2012b). The problem is that the majority of students who are studying an L2 are only reaching a novice level of proficiency (ACTFL, 2012b). Failure to have a large percentage of citizens who are proficient in an L2 may also negatively impact our economy and national security (CIA, 2010; Cutshall, 2017).     The purpose of this study was to determine if the infusion of music videos into a traditional secondary school Spanish I curriculum could improve vocabulary, grammar, reading, and listening skills more effectively than the traditional curriculum without music. One hundred and twenty-seven students had their pre-test and post-test scores analyzed to determine how much Spanish knowledge was gained in a 15-lesson thematic unit of instruction. The control and experimental groups each had three class sections of students.     Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to determine if a significant difference existed between the two groups, while controlling for pre-test differences.      A statistically significant difference was detected for the vocabulary section at the junior high level favoring the music treatment. A significant difference was detected for the grammar section favoring the combined high school and junior high groups with the control treatment. No differences were detected for listening or reading comprehension or the composite post-test scores.     In addition, students were surveyed with five questions about their preferences for learning and their plans to continue studying Spanish. Students most frequently answered that they listened to music for enjoyment on a daily basis, they chose to study Spanish to be prepared for university requirements, they preferred learning Spanish though studying vocabulary lists and flashcards, and they liked learning Spanish. Junior high students planned to study Spanish for four years or more, while high school students planned to study for a total of two years. There was a statistically significant correlation between enjoyment of Spanish and plans to study it longer.",1
"Design, application and evaluation of a programme teaching emotional education through music to fourth grade students in primary education","INTRODUCTION:Guided by the principles of quality education, the Programa d’Educació Emocional a través de la Música(Programme for Emotional Education through Music, PEEM) for fourth-grade students in primary education builds a communicative bridge between music and the emotions. The Programme, which is regulated by the Spanish educational law 8/2013 (LOMCE) and Royal decrees 126/2014 and 108/2014, has been informed by the theoretical research of the Research Group on Psychoeducational Counseling (GROP). METHOD: The objective is to address the lack of emotional educational initiatives in the educational system.The work presented here is the result of experimental and exploratory evaluative research conducted in state schools in Valencia. From a social-constructivist approach, the students develop their emotional competencies with the help of a cooperative and interactive methodology that generates emotional experiences which, through the class subject of music, become motivating learning situations. RESULTS: The results show that all of the objectives of the study were achieved. CONCLUSION: The data allow us to conclude that educational interventions designed to develop students’ emotional skills through music improve self-esteem and school performance.",0
"Toward a <i>Corridista</i> Consciousness: Learning From One Transnational Youth's Critical Reading, Writing, and Performance of Mexican Corridos","This article examines instances of a U.S.–Mexican transnational youth honing his critical translingual literacy skills through his engagement with corridos, Mexican balladry in Spanish that often emphasizes injustice and border strife. The author relies on ethnographic classroom observations, the student's journals, and semistructured interviews to provide a glimpse into the complexities and sophistication of the bilingual youth's everyday language and literacy practices in an era of vehement anti‐immigrant rhetoric. This inquiry asks, (a) What do literacy practices deeply rooted in corridos look like? (b) How does one youth read and engage with the Mexican musical genre of corridos to make sense of his social and political world? and (c) What are the environments and educational settings that supported this literacy development? Findings detail a transnational youth's corridista (balladeer) consciousness and its concomitant language and literacy practices that shape and are shaped by his participation in both his Tijuana communities of origin and his Los Angeles communities. Specifically, this study showcases a student's uses of literary devices, including allegory, to describe myriad forms of oppression and resistance found in corrido lyrics and throughout the lives of U.S.–Mexican transnational youths. Attention to literary genres that are often unsanctioned in traditional English‐medium classrooms and recognizing the complex cognitive abilities of bilinguals can harvest critical insight about literacy education in and out of school. Implications from this study highlight meaningful learning contexts for transnational adolescents’ literacies and how engagement of these literacies might be (re)conceptualized through an ethnic studies and Chicanx/Latinx Studies lens.Alternate abstract:本文考查一名美国墨西哥跨国青年通过参与西班牙语墨西哥民谣创作以操練其批判性,跨语言读写文化技巧的一些实例,这类墨西哥民谣经常强调不公义和边界纷争。本文作者依靠人誌學研究法的课堂观察、学生日志和半结构化访谈,以助探视在激烈反移民言论的时代中,双语青年日常语言和读写文化实践的复杂性和熟练程度。本研究提出三个问题:(a) 深深植根于西班牙语墨西哥民谣的读写文化实践是怎样的?(b)一个青年如何阅读和投入墨西哥民谣歌曲体裁创作以求了解他的社会和政治世界?(c)哪些环境和教育场景能支援这种读写文化发展?本研究结果详细说明一名跨国青年之民谣作者意识,及其同步语言和读写文化实践,以及这些方面如何塑造和被该青年的原籍提华纳社区参与及其洛杉矶社区参与所塑造。具体而言,本研究展示了这学生的一些文学手段使用,包括寓言,以描述出现于西班牙语墨西哥民谣歌词和美国墨西哥跨国青年整个生活的各种形式的压迫与反抗。有注意到在传统英语授课教室中往往无须经批准的文学体裁,以及认识到双语者认知能力的复杂性,便可获取对学校内外读写文化教育的深入洞悉。本研究结果的启示突显出有助跨国青少年多文化发展的有意义学习环境,以及如何可以透过一个种族研究和美籍墨西哥裔/美籍拉丁裔研究的透镜, (再) 概念化这些读写文化活动的参与。Alternate abstract:Este artículo examina ocasiones en las que un joven transnacional estadounidense mexicano va perfeccionando sus habilidades de alfabetismo críticas entre los idiomas por medio de su interés en corridos, baladas mexicanas en español que a menudo enfatizan injusticias y la lucha fronteriza. El autor se basa en observaciones etnográficas en el salón de clase, diarios del estudiante, y entrevistas semiestructuradas para vislumbrar las complejidades y la sofisticación del lenguaje diario y las prácticas de alfabetismo de este joven bilingüe en una época de retórica enérgica contra inmigrantes. Esta indagación pregunta, (a) ¿cómo son las prácticas de alfabetismo profundamente arraigadas en los corridos? (b) ¿cómo lee y participa un joven con el género musical mexicano del corrido al tratar de darle sentido a su mundo social y político? y (c) ¿cuáles son los medioambientes y los entornos docentes que apoyan este desarrollo de alfabetismo? Las conclusiones detallan la conciencia corridista y las prácticas concomitantes de lenguaje y alfabetismo del joven transnacional que moldean y son moldeadas por su participación en tanto sus comunidades de origen en Tijuana como en sus comunidades en Los Ángeles. En específico, este estudio muestra el uso del estudiante de dispositivos literarios, inclusive la alegoría, para describir múltiples instancias de opresión y resistencia que se encuentran en las letras de los corridos y en la vida de jóvenes transnacionales estadounidense‐mexicanos. Pegarle atención a géneros literarios que a menudo no son sancionados en las aulas tradicionales de habla inglesa y reconocer las complejas habilidades cognitivas de los bilingües puede brindar una percepción crítica sobre la educación literaria dentro y fuera de la escuela. Las implicaciones de este estudio destacan contextos docentes significativos para el alfabetismo de adolescentes transnacionales y cómo la participación en estos alfabetismos podría ser (re)conceptualizado por medio de un lente de estudios étnicos chicanx/latinx.Alternate abstract:تدرس هذه المقالة حالت شاب مواطن أمريكي مكسيكي صَقَلَ مهاراته لمحو الأمية عبر اللغة من خلال مشاركته مع الكوريدوس (corridos)، أغنية شعبية مكسيكية باللغة الإسبانية التي غالبا ما تركز على الظلم والنزاعات الحدودية. ويعتمد المؤلف على ملاحظات الفصول الدراسية الإثنوغرافية، ومذكرات الطالب، والمقابلات شبه المنظمة لتقديم لمحة عن تعقيدات وتشابكات اللغة اليومية الثنائية وممارسات محو الأمية في حقبة من التصريحات الشديدة المناهضة للمهاجرين. وتتساءل هذا الدراسة عما يلي: (أ) ما هي ممارسات محو الأمية المُتَجَذِّرة بعمق في الكوريدوس؟ (ب) كيف يقرأ أحد الشباب النوع الموسيقي المكسيكي من الكوريدوس ويتفاعل معه ليعبر عن عالمه الاجتماعي والسياسي؟ و (ج) ما هي البيئات والأوساط التعليمية التي تدعم هذا التطور؟ وتورد النتائج بالتفصيل وعي الشاب كمغني شعبي وما يصاحب ذلك من ممارسات اللغة ومحو الأمية التي تُشَكِّل وتَتَشَكَّل عبر مشاركته في كل من مجتمعاته الأصلية في تيخوانا ومجتمعاته في لوس أنجلوس. على وجه التحديد، تعرض هذه الدراسة استخدامات الطالب للأدوات الأدبية، بما في ذلك الرموز، لوصف أشكال لا حصر لها من الاضطهاد والمقاومة وُجِدَت في كلمات الأغنية الشعبية وطيلة حياة الشباب الأمريكي المكسيكي. إن الانتباه إلى الأنواع الأدبية التي غالبا ما تكون غير مستعملة في الفصول الدراسية بالاوسات الإنجليزية والاعتراف بالقدرات المعرفية المعقدة لثنائي اللغة يمكن أن تحصد رؤية حاسمة حول تعليم القراءة والكتابة داخل وخارج المدرسة. تسلط الآثار المترتبة على هذه الدراسة الضوء على سياقات تعلم ذات مغزى لمهارات المراهقين ثنائي الجنسية، وكيف يمكن إعادة صياغة هذه المعارف من خلال عدسة دراسات عرقية للمكسيكيين الامريكين/والاتينين.Alternate abstract:Юный житель США мексиканского происхождения оттачивает критические навыки транслингвистической грамотности на корридос – мексиканских балладах на испанском языке, зачастую посвященных несправедливости и столкновениям на границе. Почему и как это происходит? В основе исследования: этнографические наблюдения на уроках, дневники и полуструктурированные интервью – благодаря этому сейчас, в эпоху яростной антииммигрантской риторики, повседневный язык и грамотность двуязычного юноши проанализированы во всей сложности и глубине. Исследование ставит следующие вопросы: (а) Как выглядят языковые практики, берущие свое начало в корридос? (б) Как современный юноша считывает текст и осваивает музыку корридос, как соотносит его с собственным социальным и политическим миром? c) Что в окружающей среде и образовательных условиях способствует развитию подобной грамотности? Описано балладное сознание юноши‐транснационала и сопутствующие этому сознанию языковые и текстовые практики, которые формируются благодаря его участию в жизни общины происхождения, Тихуаны, и его социальной жизни в Лос‐Анджелесе. В частности, исследование демонстрирует, как ученик пользуется стилистическими приемами – в том числе, аллегорией – для описания бесчисленных форм угнетения и сопротивления, которые встречаются в текстах корридос и в жизни молодых мигрантов в США. Если обращать внимание на литературные жанры, на которые при традиционном обучении часто наложено вето, если признавать сложные познавательные способности двуязычных людей, можно сделать принципиально важные выводы о возможных путях развития грамотности в школе и за ее пределами. Результаты выявляют значимые контексты для развития грамотности транснациональной молодежи и демонстрируют, что такие практики можно концептуализировать через этнические исследования – в частности, исслеуя выходцев из Мексики и Латинской Америки.Alternate abstract:Cet article examine des exemples d'un jeune américano‐mexicain en travaillant sur ses compétences de littératie dans le cadre de son investissement dans les corridos, compositions populaires qui mettent souvent l'accent sur l'injustice et les conflits frontaliers.

Enhancing the role of pragmatics in primary English teacher training,"Teaching EFL in primary school is no longer a novelty but firmly established in the education landscape throughout Europe and many countries worldwide. Primary English language teaching (PELT) is a unique branch of ELT insofar as it entails both the teaching of children and beginners. While PELT teachers and PELT teacher educators largely agree that this concurrence of ‘young plus beginning’ requires a focus on vocabulary, speaking and listening, introduced and practiced through songs, games, stories, roleplaying and embodiment techniques such as Total Physical Response, pragmatic aspects often take a backseat in PELT teacher training and by extension in the PELT classroom, even though it has been established that pragmatics instruction is necessary and feasible on all proficiency levels, right from the beginning. This article discusses possible reasons for this omission and illustrates with authentic examples why pragmatics should play a bigger role in the training of primary English teachers",0
Language and Music: The Influences on ESOL Proficiency Achievement,"There are substantial individual differences related to second language learners’ developmental skills. This study explores the correlation between language and music that can contribute for second language learners (L2) to achieve ESOL Proficiency. The L2 students from 6, 7, and 8 grades randomly selected were tested individually, with and without the exposure of instrumental music to matching words. The chosen categorical and congruent words are happy and neutral words correlated with the positive and relaxing music. The researcher examined whether exposure to instrumental music lead to differences in language proficiency. The results comparing the group of means suggest a significant difference on the group mean tested with music. The outcomes of this study were considered in light of some relevant work in the psychology of learning, linguistics, and neuroscience to shed light on the process of learning a new language in school age children. Keywords: Language, Music, Word Matching, ESOL Proficiency",0
An Examination of Teaching Strategies for Reading and Testing in Digital Format,"The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for ELA/Literacy, and the standardized assessments that test students on these standards, focus on students’ ability to navigate online text and require students to comprehend, analyze, and make inferences about complex texts in both print and digital format. While the ability to read digital text with a high level of comprehension is necessary for 21st Century learners, the transition from reading printed text to reading digital forms of text has posed new challenges for novice readers in learning to execute the processes of deep reading that promote comprehension (Singer & Alexander, 2017). The purpose of this phenomenological study was to identify teachers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of strategies and practices utilized by high-performing schools to build comprehension of digital text and prepare their students for online testing in English Language Arts. Twenty elementary school teachers were identified through social media as meeting the criteria for a purposeful sampling of educators who provided ELA/Literacy instruction in high performing schools during the 2016-2017 school year. Research results, obtained through In-depth Individual Interviews (IDI), indicated that providing reading instruction in print and online, as well as facilitating conversations about text, providing opportunities for instruction and practice of close reading strategies, writing responses to text, and taking practice assessments can build the deep reading skills necessary for success in reading deeply and testing in online formats.",0
Content- and Language-Integrated Learning- Based Strategies for the Professional Development of Early Childhood Education Pre-Service Teachers,"This research article presents the results of an exploratory study that was conducted with a group of 14 early childhood education pre-service teachers at a private Colombian university. It intended to determine: 1) The amount of metalanguage expressions used for the teaching of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and used for the teaching of contents in FL. 2) The amount of concepts related to the previous topics pre-service teachers were able to learn in a 7-session (14 face-to-face hours) course based on a methodology inspired by the approach of Content and Language Integrated learning (CLIL), using songs, rhymes, and poems in English to young children. 3) The degree of difficulty the pre-service teachers perceived about teaching English and contents in English to young children. The study is quasi experimental because it was performed with pre-study and post-study tests of only one group, and it is quantitative because only quantitative data were analyzed using a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test and a non-parametric measure of rank correlation. The pre-service teachers were found to successfully learn vocabulary and concepts, but their perceptions about the degree of difficulty of teaching English as a Foreign Language and contents in a Foreign Language remained basically the same as they were before the course started. Besides, the correlation between the participants’ level of English and their learning process was analyzed, as well as the correlation between their level of English and their perceptions about the degree of difficulty of teaching EFL and contents in FL. The results show a strong correlation in the first case; but no correlation for the second one.Alternate abstract:Este artículo de investigación presenta un estudio exploratorio que se realizó con un grupo de 14 estudiantes de pedagogía infantil en una universidad privada colombiana. El estudio pretende determinar: 1. La cantidad de expresiones de metalenguaje usadas para enseñar inglés como lengua extranjera y para enseñar contenidos en una segunda lengua. 2. La cantidad de conceptos relacionados con estos temas anteriormente mencionados, que los estudiantes de pedagogía infantil aprendieron en un curso de 7 sesiones presenciales (14 horas en total) siguiendo una metodología inspirada en el enfoque del Aprendizaje Integrado de Contenido y Lengua (AICLE). El tema del curso era la enseñanza de canciones, rimas y poemas a niños de primera infancia. 3. Así mismo, el estudio también pretende determinar la percepción que tienen los estudiantes de pedagogía infantil sobre el grado de dificultad de enseñar inglés y contenidos en inglés a niños de primera infancia. El estudio es exploratorio y cuasi experimental ya que se realizó una prueba inicial y una prueba final de sólo un grupo; y es cuantitativo debido a que únicamente se analizó información cuantitativa por medio de un test de hipótesis estadística no paramétrica y una medida no paramétrica de rangos de correlación. En los resultados se observó que los estudiantes fueron exitosos en el aprendizaje de vocabulario y conceptos, aunque sus percepciones iniciales sobre la dificultad de la enseñanza de inglés como Lengua Extranjera y de contenidos en Lengua Extranjera se mantuvieron estables durante la intervención. Así mismo se analizó la correlación entre el nivel de inglés de los participantes y su proceso de aprendizaje y entre el nivel de inglés de los participantes y su percepción sobre la enseñanza. Para el primer caso, la correlación mostró ser alta, mientras que en el segundo caso no se encontró correlación.Alternate abstract:Cet article de recherche présente une étude exploratoire menée auprès d’un groupe de 14 étudiants en éducation élémentaire dans une université colombienne privée. L’étude vise à déterminer : 1. La quantité d’expressions de métalangage utilisée pour enseigner l’anglais langue étrangère et de la matière dans une deuxième langue. 2. Le nombre de concepts liés aux sujets déjà mentionnés que les étudiants en pédagogie de l’enfance ont appris dans un cours de 7 séances de classe (14 heures au total) selon une méthodologie inspirée par l’Enseignement d’une Matière Intégrée à une Langue (EMILE). Le thème du cours était l’enseignement de chansons, rimes et poèmes aux petits enfants. 3. L’étude vise également à déterminer la perception des étudiants en pédagogie sur le degré de difficulté d’enseigner l’anglais et de la matière en anglais aux petits enfants. Cette étude est exploratoire et quasi expérimentale parce qu’elle examine un test initial et un final dans un seul groupe ; et elle est quantitative, parce qu’elle analyse seulement des informations quantitatives en utilisant un test d’hypothèses statistiques non paramétriques et une mesure non paramétrique de séries de corrélation. Les résultats ont montré que les étudiants ont réussi l’apprentissage du vocabulaire et des concepts correspondants, bien que leurs perceptions initiales sur la difficulté de l’enseignement de l’anglais comme langue étrangère et le contenu en langue étrangère soient demeurées stables au cours de l’intervention. De même, on a analysé la corrélation entre le niveau d’anglais des participants et leur processus d’apprentissage, et entre le niveau d’anglais des participants et leur perception de l’enseignement. Dans le premier cas, la corrélation a été élevée tandis que dans le second, aucune corrélation n’a été trouvée.",0
Driving Gender Diversity IN COMPUTER SCIENCE,"Reshma Saujani, CEO of Girls Who Code, gets to the central essence of the issue in a 2017 interview with EdSurge: ""We're living in a time where we're dependent on American women as our bread winners - [research from the Decennial Census and American Community Surveys indicates 40] percent of American women are the ones who pay the mortgage, who put food on the table (Wang, Parker & Taylor, 2013).     A growing number of states recognize computer science toward graduation credits for math, science and even, in Texas, foreign language (Zinth, 2016).     At the heart of this myriad of possibilities are problem-solving, critical thinking and coding skills - and they're becoming applicable, often essential, to nearly every industry. * Journalists need CSS and HTML skills to modify their work online. * Audio engineers in music, film and live events need programming skills to create the sounds and audiovisual spaces their industries want. * Knowledge workers who use spreadsheets need to know basic .CSV commands, functions and scripting to create dynamic reports and data visualizations. * Designers are closer to the code behind apps and websites than ever before, often working directly with developers to bring concepts to life. * Marketers need programming skills to build campaigns, generate leads and grow companies. * Government employees increasingly need data visualization and management skills to make decisions. * Urban planners need data visualization and manipulation skills to understand the present and future of their communities. 2.

"Silence as borderland: a semiotic approach to the ""silent"" pupil in nineteenth-century vocal education","At the heart of the nineteenth-century educational soundscape lies a paradox. Whilst ""modern"" classrooms generally strived for orderly silence, the goal of its educational practices was the production of competent ""citizens"". Middle-class boys in particular were expected to acquire a voice fit for business, the professions, or even (political) public speech whilst quietly listening to a teacher. This silence within the educational institution has generally been understood as an element of discipline. In this paper I want to examine the paradox of the silent classroom and the speaking citizen. I will focus specifically on those instances where the clear goal of education was vocal sound (i.e. fluent speech, civilised pronunciation, and song) and look at how silence was mobilised by educators. I will argue that the silences employed in these educational practices were not (only) tools of order and discipline, but rather means to create a ""borderland"" where the leap between childhood and its uncivilised noises, and adulthood and its rational speech, could be made.I will draw upon the interpretations of silence as ""in between"" signs as it has been developed by semioticians to analyse a corpus of sources consisting mainly of French, German, and English pedagogical literature focusing on the development of children's voices. Reframing the place of silence in ""institutionalised"" education allows us to delve deeper into the specific ways in which ""discipline"" (re)produced and articulated dichotomies of power.",0
Dolphins in the House!,"In the year 2011, Chelsea Cook completed her first level of the Orff Schulwerk--the unique approach to music education that helps every child, regardless of skill level, to make meaningful music--and was determined to put it to use right away. With every stroke of the students' mallets, it became more evident that the lesson would crash and burn, so Cook invited the students who wanted to continue learning the song to stop by her classroom the next morning. One boy showed up the first day, bringing more friends on subsequent days until a full group of eager students had formed. This ensemble became affectionately known as the Dynamic Dolphins, Cook says. The Dynamic Dolphins now has a number of accolades to its credit, including three consecutive championships at the Music USA Festival in Orlando FL, and winning Gold at the Southern Star Music Festival in Atlanta.",0

The effect of songs on vocabulary retention of preschool young English language learners,"The present study was an attempt to investigate the effectiveness of teaching English vocabulary through song to preschool young English Language Learners in Aligoodarz, Iran. The participants of the study consisted of 103 preschool young learners, who were divided into two groups of experimental group and control group. The experimental groups were consisted of 62 young learners and the control groups were consisted of 51 young learners at the age of six. The experimental groups were instructed using song and the control groups were instructed using non-song methods. Twenty sessions were spent working on teaching vocabulary for each group. Before starting the treatment, an interview was done as a pretest by the teacher to confirm that learners did not have any prior knowledge of English. After finishing the treatment, the post-test was administered by the teacher to measure the amount of learning vocabulary items in each group. The data then was analyzed using the SPSS. The findings revealed that the experimental group improved significantly in terms of vocabulary retention compared to control group.",1
"""Let me introduce you to Crete”: A CLIL Project in the English as a Foreign Language Classroom","This paper presents the design and the implementation results of a CLIL project in the context of Greek primary education. CLIL approach has been practiced across Europe for the last two decades, with proven positive effects on the language skills of foreign language learners (Korosidou & Griva, 2013; Lasagabaster, 2008). The present project was piloted in a 6th grade classroom of 18 students in Rethymno, Crete. The topic of the project was ""Let me introduce you to Crete"". The present project was introduced to serve the aim of developing students' EFL (English as a Foreign Language) receptive and productive skills (reading, listening, speaking, writing) through a project focusing on Cretan history and culture. The thematic areas consisting the core of the project were the following: 1) Geographical features of the Cretan districts, 2) History and culture in Crete, 3) Traditional Cretan products and diet, 4) Cretan music and dance tradition and 5) Tourism in Crete. Language learning was integrated with the specific subject matters of Geography, History and culture and Art. For the evaluation of the project, the following basic tools were used: a) journals kept by the teacher and b) interviews with the students. The findings of project evaluation indicated students' improvement regarding both their receptive and productive skills in the target language, and the development of children's cultural awareness and their sensitivity and respect towards local history.Alternate abstract:Η παρούσα εργασία παρουσιάζει το σχεδιασμό και τα αποτελέσματα μιας πιλοτικής εφαρμογής ενός διαθεματικού project με θέμα «Επιτρέψετε μου να σας ξεναγήσω στην Κρήτη» με τη μέθοδο Ολοκληρωμένης Εκμάθησης Περιεχομένου και Γλώσσας (CLIL) στην τάξη εκμάθησης της Αγγλικής ως ξένης γλώσσας. Στη συγκεκριμένη διδακτική πρόταση 18 μαθητές της Στ’ τάξης Δημοτικού Σχολείου του Ρεθύμνου συμμετείχαν σε ποικίλες δραστηριότητες μέσα σε ένα πολυτροπικό και πολυαισθητηριακό περιβάλλον μάθησης, με τη χρήση οπτικών κειμένων, ποστερ, βίντεο και ψηφιακών χαρτών. Ο στόχος της παρέμβασης ήταν διττός: α) να ενισχυθούν οι παραγωγικές δεξιότητες των μαθητών στη Γ2 μέσα από ένα project που εστιάζει στην Κρητική ιστορία, καθώς και β) να αποτιμηθεί η επίδραση της παρέμβασης αναφορικά με τις επιδόσεις των μαθητών στη Γ2. Τα αποτελέσματα της παρέμβασης κατέδειξαν ότι η επίδραση του project ήταν ιδιαίτερα θετική, με σημαντικές βελτιώσεις στις παραγωγικές δεξιότητες των μαθητών στη γλώσσα στόχο. Παράλληλα, παρατηρήθηκε ότι βελτιώθηκαν σημαντικά οι γνώσεις των παιδιών σε ζητήματα τοπικής ιστορίας και πολιτισμού.",0
Teach your pupils the art of coding,"Coding is part of the curriculum now, but why do we have to treat it as a technical subject when children think of it as a creative endeavour, asks Christian Darkin Ican't teach coding - the kids are better at it than I am."" Just like learning to paint, or use grammar, it requires a few technical skills, but is it not really about those skills. If you're an arts teacher, a music teacher, an English teacher, and your student produces an idea that you wouldn't have thought of in a million years, you don't feel intimidated. Pupils will swap ideas and use each other's techniques as much as yours, like a noisy art class - but that's okay. Just as in an art class, some children will be better at different media. In coding, some will be interested in programming the mechanics of a game, while others may be more driven by developing a cartoon's story or drawing the individual frames that make a movement. Christian Darkin is a children's author and animator, writing stories with scientific and technological themes. [...]you could do the same with the movement of all the footballers on a pitch, or all the times...",0

Volume 2: Tales from the Skagit Valley as Told by Susie Sampson Peter, Dora Solomon, Mary Sampson Willup, Harry Moses, Louise Anderson, Martin Sampson, Dewey Mitchell, and Alice Williams","The previous publications include several bilingual collections of stories (e.g., Sampson 1995; Shelton 1998); a bilingual volume of stories with discussion, commentary, and annotation (Bierwert 1996); three Lushootseed Reader volumes with audiotapes that teach grammar needed to read the stories (Hess 1995, 1998, 2006); and several publications of stories in Lushootseed and English translation with accompanying commentary and notes (e.g., Moses and Langen 1998). The new volumes, like all the previously published materials, are selected from stories recorded by the last generation of elders who spoke dxwbsucid as a mother tongue and who worked in the 1950s with Leon Metcalf (a high school music teacher) and in the 1960s with linguist Thom Hess, who, in turn, later worked on transcribing and translating the stories with shudubs- (Snohomish-) speaking elders and with Vi tacfsoblu? The publication of two such magnificent sets of collections alongside previous publications of dxwbsucid stories and collections from other Salish languages, such as the Stiati imc (Lillooet) narratives edited by Matthewson (2005), for instance, opens up comparative possibilities and questions: about the format used to present stories and for whom they are intended; about the representation of ""authorship"" or ""editorship""; about the value of different types of translation; and also about the name(s) used to talk about the stories themselves (e.g., what kinds of connotations do the various terms ""stories,"" ""traditional stories,"" ""tellings,"" ""narratives,"" ""texts,"" and ""myths"" hold?).

"Revolutionizing the English Classroom through Consciousness, Justice, and Self-Awareness","Dr. Christopher Emdin once described a classroom setting where students were lulled to sleep by the monotony of a lesson. Although the teacher was fully engaged in a rhythmic performance of teaching, when Emdin looked at the faces across the room, everybody was asleep in different variations of what sleep should look like Head on hand, nodding all the way back, just asleep. As if by fate, a sudden rumbling noise somehow seemed to bring the children to life. It was the bass line of a rap song. Emdin details the life and emotion that filled the room as the kids awoke in excitement -- the bass permeating the space, the lyrics all too familiar. For all students, but desperately for Black students, English teachers should be librarians of justice, hope, and consciousness. English classrooms should provide something more complex than grammar, something deeper than the classics, and something much more meaningful than writing between the lines, copying the directions legibly.",0

Music Education in Schools – what is taught? A comparison of curriculum in Sweden and Australia,"Music has been a subject offered in schools for some time across the globe. Students will often study music, alongside other arts subjects or as a stand-alone music course, during the primary school years and at selected times during secondary school. Despite music being an important subject within schooling, other subjects such as English, maths and science are often privileged over the arts. Most countries have their own music curriculum that describes the intended learning within music, however few studies have explored the similarities and differences of music curriculum across countries. In this study, we analyse the music curriculum of Australia and Sweden. We first present a brief history of music education in both countries and then analyse the music curriculum to reveal comparative aspects. Using content analysis, we were able to identify main themes 'in the curriculum content including making and responding to music, Indigenous musics, and health and safety. Comparative studies about curriculum are important for improved curriculum development as well as understanding the different knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in music from a global perspective.",0
Gifted & Green: Sustainability/Environmental Science Investigations That Promote Gifted Children's Learning,"Environmental studies provide an ideal opportunity for gifted children of any age to build critical and creative-thinking skills while also building skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. Exploring issues related to sustainability and environmental concerns permits gifted learners to identify problems, develop research questions, gather and analyze data, develop possible solutions, and disseminate this information to others. Green issues are especially appealing to gifted learners as they are sensitive to the world around them and often long to engage in projects that touch on issues facing their communities. Although the relevance to STEM subjects is clear, green investigations can also build skills across the content areas, in diverse subjects such as English/language arts, social studies, music, and art. A variety of resources, including national and Common Core State Standards, exist that can help parents and teachers create investigations for gifted children that permit them to be both gifted and green.",0

Exiled Children: Care in English Convents in the 17th and 18th Centuries,"England's Catholic religious minority devised various strategies for its survival in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, including the establishment of seminaries and convents in continental Europe, predominantly in France and the Spanish Netherlands. These institutions educated the next generation of English Catholic clergy, nuns and lay householders. Although convent schools were usually small, the nuns educated young girls within their religious cloisters. The pupils followed a modified monastic routine, while they were taught the skills appropriate for young gentlewomen, such as music and needlework. While many students were placed in convents with the intention that they would become nuns, not all girls followed this trajectory. Some left the cloister of their childhood to join other religious houses or to return to England to marry and raise a new generation of Catholics. Although we have few first-hand accounts of these girls' experiences, it is possible to piece together a sense of their lives behind cloistered walls from chronicles, obituaries and letters. While the exiled monastic life for children was difficult, surviving evidence points to the vital role of convent care in Catholic families' strategies, and the acknowledgement of their importance by the girls placed there, whether temporarily or permanently.",0

Learning From Playing: Course Observation of an Early Childhood Education Program,"Gymboree Play & Musicw program has benefitted thousands of preschool children; however, the program's course content has not been carefully studied. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the Gymboree program on preschool children's development through observation and analysis of selected classes. Ten distinct groups from 41 Gymboree classes in 3 different subjects, including Play & Learn (L), Music (M), and Art (A), and at different age levels in 18 Chinese cities were observed and video-recorded. The videos were then coded in 10-s intervals using the Play Observation Scale (Rubin, 2001) and Physical Activities for Improving Children's Learning and Behavior (Cheatum & Hammond, 2000). The types of activities and their impact on children's sensory motor development were then summarized.

"'Everybody learns English, and so do I': The dominance of English and its effects on individuals","In some Asia-Pacific countries, English is neither an ethnic heritage nor a colonial legacy. The dominant position of English can also be a result of it being the common language for worldwide communication. The superiority of the English language in such countries manifests itself in language policy and national curricula which leads to a frantic pursuit of English. An educational trend in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam is to start English instruction early to give children an edge in second language acquisition. A rationale used for this is the positive relationship between a nation's international competiveness and the English language competence of its citizens (Baldauf & Nguyen, 2013; Hu, 2009; Park, 2009). One example of a nationwide English learning movement is 'the-earlier-the-better' in Taiwan. To win elections, electoral candidates used to propose English instruction to be available at Grade 1 (age of 6) although the Ministry of Education ruled for Grade 5 (age of 10) to be the year for English to be introduced (Chang, 2009). Another example of early English learning is overseas study in South Korea. Young children are sent to North America to receive long-term education so that they can learn to speak English without a Korean accent (Song, 2010).",0

The Effect of Explicit Affective Strategy Training on Iranian EFL learners’ Oral Language Proficiency and Anxiety Reduction,"The current study aimed at investigating the possible effects of explicit teaching of affective strategies on Iranian EFL learners’ oral language proficiency and the extent of their anxiety in EFL classroom.  First, PET test was administered to a total number of 120 female third grade high school EFL students.  Then, 60 participants whose score fell within the range of + 1 SD from the mean score were selected for the main study.  Next, they were randomly assigned into two groups (one control and one experimental).  The design of the study was Experimental comparison-group plan.  Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale adopted from Horwitz (1986) was used to examine the EFL learners’ anxiety level in English class.  Moreover, two equivalent oral tests adopted from Heaton (1975) were administered to the participants of the two groups both at the beginning and at the end of the study served as pre and post-tests.  The treatment for the experimental group included Oxford's (1990) taxonomy of affective strategies, which included explicit affective strategy instruction (in relaxation, music, visualization, humor, positive self-talk, risk-taking, and monitoring emotions).  The control group did not receive any special instruction in terms of affective strategies.  To investigate the possible effects of explicit affective strategy use instruction on the participants’ oral language proficiency and their anxiety level, the pre and posttests of oral tests and the participants’ self-reports of anxiety control in both groups were analyzed and compared.  The results of independent samples T- test indicated that while the two groups were homogeneous in terms of oral proficiency and level of anxiety control before introducing the treatment, the experimental group performed better than the control group in the oral post-test.  Moreover, the level of anxiety control for the experimental group was significantly different and higher than that of the control group.  The results confirm the positive effects of affective strategy instruction on oral language proficiency.  The findings of this study provide a greater understanding of affective strategy use among Iranian EFL learners.  This study might also have some implications for material developers to consider strategy use in materials development.",0
English Vocabulary Acquisition Through Songs in Chinese Kindergarten Students,"This paper reports an empirical study that examined the widespread practice of using songs in language teaching for young learners. The study may represent the first methodologically rigorous assessment of vocabulary acquisition through songs as used in language teaching. Over a seven-week period including fifteen 40-minute classes, three groups of students from two private kindergartens in Beijing were taught five short English phrases of 4-8 words through each of three conditions (songs, choral repetition, control) in a within-subject repeated measures design. Vocabulary acquisition was measured by the number of meaningful morphemes produced by the students in a picture description task administered before and after the teaching period. Results indicated significant acquisition for items learned through songs and choral repetition, but not for control items. The implication is that songs may indeed contain ünportant pedagogical value.",1

The Process of Musical Acquisition for Traditional String Musicians in the Homeschool Environment,"This qualitative study examined how three accomplished traditional string musicians learned music in their homeschool environments. Data were derived from formal interviews of the three musicians. The research framework for this qualitative study is based upon the socio-educational model of second language learning motivation developed by R. C. Gardner (1959, 1985, 2004, 2010) and applied to the study of instrumental music learning motivation by P. D. MacIntyre (2012). Structured interview questions, triangulated by additional informal dialogues, field observations, externally documented sources, and collaboration with an expert review panel were the data collection activities utilized in the research. Five overarching themes emerged: (1) social and cultural surroundings influence musical achievement, (2) the desire to acquire the attributes and acceptance of other musicians supports musical achievement, (3) motivation impacts musical achievement, (4) learning and performing music causes anxiety, and (5) informal learning environments foster musical attainment. The examination of homeschooled, traditional musicians via the overarching themes, may provide valuable insights for educators in the area of acquisition and development of musical skill in high school students.",0
Narrative and Multimodality in English Language Arts Curricula: A Tale of Two Nations,"The author focus on print and multimodal narrative, observing congruities and divergences between the role of narrative in English language arts curriculum policies in the elementary years in the US and Australia. Multimodality is defined here as the semiotic meanings that can be made from the interrelationship of two or more modes. Modes are sign systems that describe socially and culturally shaped semiotic resources for making meaning, be they writing, drawing, music, or drama. Narrative plays a pivotal role in the socialization of learners to the literacy practices sanctioned in mainstream education throughout the Western world. Narrative texts are an essential part of language policy in the twenty-first century, and will continue to be ubiquitous in a growing variety of media and modes, given increased affordances for combining words with other modes in digital sites of display. In this tale of two national English curricula, there is a shared valuing of the narrative genre, but with differing degrees of emphasis on multimodality and grammatical features, including image-text relations.",0
Using Admission Assessments to Predict Final Grades in a College Music Program,"Entrance examinations and auditions are common admission procedures for college music programs, yet few researchers have attempted to look at the long-term predictive validity of such selection processes. In this study, archival data from 93 student records of a German music academy were used to predict development of musicianship skills over the course of a 4-year program. Audition grades for the principal instrument, aural skills, and basic knowledge of music theory were correlated with similar data available for the final exams. Final high school grades also were available. Results indicated moderate correlations between entrance and final grades for aural skills (r = .69) and music theory (.45). Piano majors did better at aural skills and music theory than other candidates. A positive influence of keyboard proficiency also was found for the nonpiano majors. The correlation between initial and final grade on the principal instrument was dependent on the instrument category: piano (.64), followed by voice (.55), winds (.24), and strings (.05). Stronger academic performance prior to college was associated with superior performance in academic subjects in college, whereas no influence was found for academic strength on students' principal instrument performance.",0

The foreign language learning value beliefs of Japanese elementary school students.,"This study was an investigation of student beliefs about their EFL education, and it was based upon the subjective task value component of the expectancy-value theory, a prominent theory of achievement motivation. The participants were three cohorts of Japanese public elementary school students (Cohort 1 from 2008; Cohort 2 from 2009; and Cohort 3 from 2010); each cohort consisted of third through sixth graders (N = 1,478; N = 3,693; and N = 1,336, respectively). Three research questions with associated hypotheses were posited in order to determine: (a) if students of all age groups could differentiate the three value components of Enjoyment, Importance, and Use; (b) the degree to which grade levels and genders were different with regard to each value; and (c) if grade level and gender differences were consistent between cohorts. The Young Learners Value Scale (YLVS) was an 11-item, 4-point Likert self report scale created in order to investigate elementary school students' values concerning their EFL education. Prior to conducting inferential analyses on the collected data, the dimensionality, validity, and reliability of the YLVS were established through the use of the Rasch rating-scale model. In addition, the raw scores were converted into interval Rasch measures. Results of the principal components analyses showed that each grade level was able to differentiate the three values of Enjoyment, Importance, and Use. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the instrument measures as well as the factorial structure of the theoretical model were both invariant across grade level. Results of the two-way ANOVAs indicated that the third grade students valued the Enjoyment, Importance, and Use of English to a statistically significant higher degree than the higher grade levels. Descriptive statistics showed that all grade levels valued the Enjoyment and Importance of English, yet all grade levels responded neutrally to the Use of English. With regard to gender, female students held statistically significant greater values of Enjoyment, Importance, and Use of English and their EFL class than boys, yet these differences were found for only Cohorts 2 and 3. This study was the first, to the best of my knowledge, to use the expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation as a basis for an investigation of public school EFL students. The results indicated that the elementary school students valued the Enjoyment and Importance of English, but were neutral to the Use of English. The integration of more skill-based activities that focus on listening to English and speaking in English to communicate to others and a reduction in fun-focused activities such as songs and games might provide a greater opportunity to enhance the students' value of Use.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PITCH DISCRIMINATION AND ROMANIAN STUDENTS' SPELLING PERFORMANCE,Previous studies have shown that music can have a positive impact on phonological awareness and on foreign language acquisition. The present research investigates specifically the role of pitch discrimination ability in native and foreign language spelling performance. Two groups of elementary school children were selected based on their pitch discrimination abilities (high and low). Their spelling performance in their native and a foreign (fictional) language was assessed. The results indicate that pitch discrimination ability can be linked to spelling ability in both the native and a foreign language. They also suggest that studying a musical instrument might predict enhanced spelling performance ability,0

Every Child Ready to Read,"After opening the revised Every Child Ready to Read (ECRR) presentation tool kit in fall 2011, the author immediately saw why her colleagues were raving. It includes research information, but it is much more than research. It has video clips, talking points, and handouts. However, in a very real sense, it exudes joy. The tool kit is meant to focus this joy through the five practices of early literacy -- talking, singing, reading, writing, and playing. Her outreach staff and she have used the tool kit frequently to instruct parents, both English and Spanish-speaking, who are mostly low-income, low-educated, and even sometimes homeles. The ECRR committee, a joint ALSC/PLA group, offered a dozen conference programs and webinars in 2012 to demonstrate how librarians across the country are applying the tool kit. Several hundred participants learned about the kit's value, explored common sense tips on training adults, discovered how to build relationships with parents and caregivers, and pondered the joy of the five practices.",0

The Professional Learning Community as a Model to Improve Student Achievement in Grade 4 English Language Arts,"The Professional Learning Community as a Model to Improve Student Achievement in Grade 4 English Language Arts. Joseph Foster Drolette, 2012: Applied Dissertation, Nova Southeastern University, Abraham S. Fischler School of Educations. ERIC Descriptors: Educational Environment, Collaborative Teachers, Professional Development, Instructional Effectiveness, Teacher Leadership    This applied dissertation was designed to determine if a reform initiative to develop professional learning communities within a local public school district would impact student achievement and improve the culture of the school district. The purpose of program evaluation was to examine to what extent, if any, the establishment of a professional learning community (PLC) among the teachers in Grade 4 had on student achievement and what impact, if any, the PLC of the teachers in Grade 4 would impact school culture at the elementary level. The PLC model is used to facilitate teachers' collaborative working groups, promote shared decision making between teachers and administrators, and address student achievement issues. With a significant number of research articles and case studies available, the PLC model is a vehicle to formalize teacher collaboration in the areas of curriculum planning, analysis of student data, strategic planning, and shared decision making.    Student data from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment was used to measure the impact of the professional development activities of the PLC on student achievement. Results from Grade 4 DIBELS data were used to assess the effectiveness of PLC professional development training. DIBELS data from previous school year cohorts were analyzed for comparative purposes to assess the PLC impact. An analysis of the DIBELS data results revealed a decline in the number of at-risk students following the implementation of the PLC. Inclusion of additional grade levels and extending the time of the study over several academic years could enhance future research.    The School Professional Staff as Learning Community Questionnaire (SPSLCQ), a 16-question Likert-scale survey to measure the degree of effectiveness the PLC model has on school culture and teacher perceptions concerning the effect of PLC activities, was used in a pre- and postintervention format. The PLC, composed of 24 Grade 4 teachers and including specialists who delivered music, art, and physical education, completed the SPSLCQ. For the purposes of reporting, survey results were divided into five dimensions: shared leadership, shared vision, collective creativity, peer review, and supportive conditions. The researcher compared the mean scores of the pretest and posttest results in the five dimensions to determine if the activities of the PLC were effective in producing a significant difference in the mean scores. An analysis of the data did not reveal a statistically significant difference in pretest and posttest mean scores. Future research could broaden the sample size with the inclusion of multiple grade-level teachers and extending the time period of the study.",0
TEACHING GRAMMAR THROUGH MUSIC,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the practical ways in which English grammar can be taught to lower secondary students. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of using songs in teaching grammar to second language students. It also sought to explore the effects of song-based grammar instruction on both students' motivation and classroom atmosphere, as well as to assess teachers' perception regarding the use of songs in teaching grammar. In order to achieve the purpose, an experiment was carried out over one school semester. The 34 students in the seventh grade were assigned as a control group and an experimental group based on the results in the pre-test. Both groups were taught by the same teacher and using the same teaching programme with one difference: the control group performed a traditional grammar-based exercise programme, while for the experimental group a song-based practice was used. To collect data tests, questionnaires and field notes were used. All data was discussed in relation to the research questions and hypothesis. The experimental group students reported that songs helped them learn more and also increased their level of motivation. The songs had a positive effect on the classroom atmosphere. The students also believe that songs as a teaching method are fun and create a learning environment that encourages interaction between students and teachers, encourages active participation and enables students to demonstrate and apply previously or newly acquired language knowledge. It is also to be noted that the results on the level of grammatical knowledge in the grammar post-tests show that there is no significant difference between the two groups of students. However, the main finding does not support the common perception regarding the validity of songs as a recommended learning and teaching strategy that emerged from most of the literature review presented in Chapter 2.",1
The effect of using music as a socio-affective strategy to teach English to a second grade Down syndrome student,"The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of the use of music in a Down syndrome student oral comprehension as well as on his grade improvement in the English class. The research questions were aimed to answer the following queries: What is the effect of using music as an affective strategy on the English vocabulary acquisition of an eight year old second grade Down syndrome student? Does the use of music as a teaching strategy lead the student to improve his grades in the English class? The participant was an eight year old Down syndrome student who attended the second grade. He received treatment 90 minutes per week over a period of six weeks. The research instrument used was a test. A case study research was performed using a pretest-posttest applied to the same participant. A comparison between the participant's statistical answer before and after using the affective strategy was done. Furthermore, a comparison with the amount of vocabulary acquisition that took place before and after the intervention was analyzed. Findings suggest that the use of songs will probably be an effective instructional strategy to teach English vocabulary to challenged elementary school populations, especially students with Down syndrome. According to data results three conclusions can be reached. First, the participant had significantly lower averages on the pretest; second, after treatment was given, he scored higher on the posttest, and third, the gain in score could apparently be attributed to the incorporation of music as a teaching strategy during the time the treatment was given. Based on the findings of the investigation, the use of songs as an affective strategy to help Down syndrome students acquire English vocabulary is recommended as a strategy that will probably facilitate vocabulary acquisition. It is suggested to teachers that work with cognitively challenged students, to incorporate the use of songs as a teaching strategy to facilitate English vocabulary acquisition. The use of songs is apparently one method for providing a positive atmosphere conducive to language learning when dealing with mentally challenged learners.

"Evaluation of Imagine Learning English, a computer-assisted instruction of language and literacy for kindergarten students","As computer assisted instruction (CAI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, its appeal as a viable method of literacy intervention with young children continues despite limited evidence of effectiveness. The present study sought to assess the impact of one such CAI program, Imagine Learning English (ILE), on both the receptive vocabulary and early literacy skills of 284 kindergarten students, including English language learners using a 2 x 2 cross-over research design over a period of a full school year. In each semester, students received either the ILE treatment or ""other"" treatment (integrated core curriculum including science, social studies, art, music, physical education). Specifically, the study sought to answer two questions: (a) How do the literacy skills of kindergarten students, including English language learners and monolingual children, who receive instruction using ILE compare with the literacy skills of kindergarten students who receive ""other"" classroom instruction; (b) how do the vocabulary skills of the same kindergarten students who receive instruction using ILE compare with the vocabulary skills of those who receive ""other"" classroom instruction? Results of the t-tests from this within-subjects design showed no treatment differences on outcome measures (PPVT-4 for receptive vocabulary and DIBELS Next for early literacy) between students when they participated in the ILE program and when they participated in ""other"" classroom activities, regardless of amount of time spent on this CAI program. These same results held true for English language learners for whom the program was originally designed. A strong period effect, however, was detected, with the treatment administered during period 1 (i.e., either ILE or ""other"" instruction) having a more positive effect on student language and literacy learning than the treatment that was administered during period 2. Possible explanations for this significant period effect are provided as well as cautions for the ongoing use of CAI programs such as ILE in early literacy education. Finally, recommendations for future research are set forth. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

Examination of the communication interface between students with severe to profound and multiple intellectual disability and educational staff during structured teaching sessions,"Individuals with severe to profound and multiple intellectual disability (S-PMID) tend to function at the earlier stages of communication development. Variable and highly individual means of communicating may present challenges to the adults providing support in everyday life. The current study aimed to examine the communication interface between students with S-PMID and educational staff. An in-depth, observational study of dyadic interaction in a class within the secondary part of a special school was conducted. The designated educational level was Key Stage 3 under the National Curriculum of England, which is typically for children from age 11 to 14 years attending a state school. There were four student-teacher dyads in the class. The students had multiple impairments with severely limited communication skills. Video capture of dyadic interaction was conducted during five English lessons and sampled to 2.5 min per dyad per lesson. The video footage was transcribed into standard orthography, detailing the vocal and non-vocal aspects. A coding framework guided by the principles of structural-functional linguistics was used to determine the nature of dyadic interaction, comprising linguistic moves, functions and communicative modalities. The relative contributions of student and teacher to the interaction were examined. Significant differences were found between the students and educational staff on the majority of the measures. The teachers dominated the interaction, occupying significantly more turns than the students. Teacher turns contained significantly more initiations and follow-up moves than the students, who used more response moves. Teacher communication mainly served the functions of requesting and information giving. Feedback and scripted functions were also significantly greater among teacher turns, with only limited occurrence among the students. Self- or shared-expression was greatest among the students. The modalities of speech, touch, singing and objects were used by the teachers for the purpose of communication, whereas vocalisation and gesture were used by the students. Despite differences in the availability of communication skills, both student and teacher were able to make their respective contributions to the interaction during classroom activity. Features of the student-teacher interface retained critical features seen in studies of more able individuals with intellectual disability. Scaffolding provided by teachers appears to be relevant to the communicative contributions of individuals functioning at the earliest stages of communication. The coding framework based on structural-functional linguistics provides some new potential for examining and enhancing the communication interface between individuals with S-PMID and the people who support them.",0
Motivating Music Learning,"Peter D MacIntyre, Gillian K Potter, and Jillian N Bames wanted to know how Robert C Garder's socio-educational model of learning a second language would work if applied study instrumental music learning. In their words, ""at the hart of proposed model is a multifaceted description of the relationships among motivation, attitudes, anxiety, support from other, perceived competence, and achievement."" Working with 107 high school band students, the researchers found that ""the adapted and expanded socio-educational model fit very well"" and ""described key motivational structures.""",0
Factors Influencing the Acquisition of Spanish Voiced Stop Spirantization during an Extended Stay Abroad,"The purpose of the current study is to investigate the acquisition of spirantization of /b, d, g/ in the Spanish of adult learners who have spent two years abroad in a Spanish-speaking country. In addition to whether or not participants acquired spirantization, this study seeks to discover the influence of certain factors (e.g. style, prior Spanish instruction, Spanish language use, attitude, motivational intensity, etc.) on their target-like pronunciation of /b, d, g/. Two different tasks were administered, one formal (a reading list) and another less formal (a read story). Tokens of /b, d, g/ were analyzed spectrographically for manner of articulation. The results show that the majority of the learners pronounced target-like /b, d, g/ over 80% of the time. A logistic regression analysis shows that the following factors are significant in their contribution to the acquisition of spirantization: Cultural Integration, Spanish language use, Empathy, Music Instruction, High School Spanish Instruction, and Motivational Intensity.

The Socio-Educational Model of Music Motivation,"The well-established socio-educational model of second language learning motivation developed by R. C. Gardner was adapted and applied to study instrumental music learning motivation. The similarities between music and language suggested that the adaptation might lead to new insights in the study of music motivation. At the heart of the proposed model is a multifaceted description of the relationships among motivation, attitudes, anxiety, support from others, perceived competence, and achievement. A sample of 107 high school band students was selected to participate in this study. Results of a path analysis of questionnaire responses indicate that the adapted and expanded socio-educational model fit very well with the present data and described key motivational structures. The key support for motivation to learn was supplied by integrativeness (an interest in taking on the characteristics of musicians, positive attitudes toward learning instruments, and an interest in music learning), plus attitudes toward the learning situation (music teacher and course).

The media and lexical borrowing: Implications for vocabulary acquisition among ESL students,"With the increasing presence of English in entertainment, technology, communications, and Internet, mass media have become a large domain for lexical borrowing to occur. To a large extent, these mass media domains have become dominant in the lives of adolescents. The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods research was to examine lexical borrowing from the mass media as a source of vocabulary acquisition in the context of learning English as a second language. The population consisted of 71 tenth grade students from a public school in the southeast of Puerto Rico. Quantitative phase one involved the administration of a questionnaire to identify the most frequent media domains where adolescents participate. As part of qualitative phase two, a content document analysis of the mass media domains of music, radio, and local TV, produced a corpus of loan words and a preliminary description of the contexts in which loan words occur. Furthermore, focus group interviews provided information regarding the use, interpretations, and trends of lexical borrowing among adolescents. Results indicated that adolescents hold ample and varied preferences regarding the media, where lexical borrowing constitutes an integral part of their linguistic repertoire. The integration of loan words, which denotes a high level of alternation and a sense of ""appropriateness,' becomes distinctive of the youth. Even though adolescents were aware that making use of loan words validates the presence of English in the Puerto Rican lexicon, especially as part of the commercial media, they revealed a positive perception of lexical borrowing and of the linguistic value of both languages. Based on the findings of this investigation, it was concluded that the media represent a space for adolescents' active participation in the appropriation of English words. In addition, the positive attitude and the creativity demonstrated in their linguistic constructions reflect a basic grasp of the meaning of loan words which would need to be extended to other aspects of vocabulary knowledge. It was recommended to be more appreciative of the linguistic market available in the media and to take advantage of the positive attitude adolescents have towards lexical borrowing to promote vocabulary acquisition.

Modern foreign languages - Now you're talking: resources,"A class I taught in Reception - who are now in Year 3 - always want to play a memory game involving painted toenails because a member of their class holds the school record for the game (he was four when he set it), and a Year 6 group remembered retelling the story of El Nabo Gigante (The Enormous Turnip) when they were in Year 2, with silly hats and actions.  [...] when I asked a group of Year 6s, they listed singing, rhymes and chanting as a favourite activity because they don't do that in other lessons.

Solving the Puzzle: Dual Language Learners with Challenging Behaviors,"Be patient, giving children time to process what you've said and respond. * Use lots of nonverbal cues - gestures, sign language, facial expression, and changes in voice tone - to enhance communication. * Add graphic organizers such as props and pictures that add meaning to interactions. * Assign language buddies.  Children may not understand your words, but if a dual language learner knows what's coming next, she is more able to participate appropriately and learn more effectively. * Use lots of music and movement activities - in home languages as well as English - to engage all the children while building early language and literacy skills. * Make the effort to get to know the families of dual language learners.",0
A Latina Teaches Dance and Awakens Ancient Culture,"When the UNM professor speaks, she does so with a love and fervor far different man that of an academic who's spent years studying and researching a subject matter. For [Eva Encinias-Sandoval], her teachings come from her blood, from generations of flamenco dancers and singers in her family. She carries with her a lineage that has maintained a profound connection to the old Spanish cultore through centuries of New Mexico roots. ""My family has been in Albuquerque for hundreds of years. It is clear mat we were one of the first families that came to this area when it was settìed,"" she said. ""In the time of my grandparents in Albuquerque, Spanish was the main language spoken here. And I am sure that Spain was part of my heritage, but I don't know how and when.""     This ""focus of energy"" is something Sandoval also teaches in her flamenco conservatory classes for younger children nights and weekends. And beyond her classes, she leads these youngsters in one of the three institute performance companies, the young children's company, Niños Flamencos, and she conducts a Flamenco Kids Camp every summer. (Her grown children run her other two compames - Joaquín Encintas is director of ""Yjastros,"" and Marisol Encimas manages ""Alma Flamenca."")     ""I hadn't taught younger children for years, and when we opened the conservatory and I had a chance to teach these kids, I really loved it,"" said Sandoval. ""I got so much from flamenco as a child, and it revolutionized my life."" Children studying flamenco with her today, she said, ""find their self-discipline and sense of self.""",0
An Ethnographic Inquiry Connecting Home to School for Literacy and Mathematics Learning of Hispanic Families,"There is limited research on bilingual classroom teachers who conduct household visits of non-English speaking Hispanic families. The author and teacher explored (a) ways that three migrant, Hispanic families were involved with their children's school to promote mathematics and language literacy learning and communication; and (b) how these Hispanic parents viewed themselves as critical partners in their child's literacy learning. Findings from four months of household visits involving interviews, observations, and analysis of student schoolwork indicated the parents held several expectations. These parents hoped for a home-school partnership based on mutual respect and trust; and they desired that their children's cultural experiences be woven into classroom learning. Older siblings served as language brokers between their non-English speaking parents and younger siblings during at home learning; and family members often code-switched when talking with each other about homework and understanding school notes. To connect with their children's mathematics learning, these parents accessed their prior learning in Mexico. While in school, these parents memorized multiplication facts and solved computation problems in their mind. These parents also enriched their children's mathematics via cooking, singing, paying utility bills, or buying refreshments from a passing ice cream vendor. These were the kinds of mathematics activities about which the parents felt most confident and knowledgeable. The parents often engaged their children in mathematics discourse at the kitchen table, living room, and the outside yard or local market. The parents' voices echoed a persistent hope that their children would one day learn school mathematics and use that knowledge to push for needed social changes. Based on the researcher's household visits, this paper recommends suggestions for improving home-school partnerships with migrant Hispanics and for reforming school mathematics' practices to incorporate the student's cultural knowledge and experience.",0
Academic achievement differences between Title I students enrolled in music classes and Title I students who are not,"Purpose. The purpose of the study was to determine academic achievement differences between those Title I students enrolled in music classes and Title I students who are not enrolled in music classes.  A second purpose was to determine educators' perceptions regarding the educational justice implications of excluding nonproficient Title I students from music.      Methodology. This was a mixed-methods study using quantitative data from the annual state achievement test and quantitative data utilizing a 7-point Likert scale measuring perceptions of teachers and administrators regarding the issue of removing nonproficient Title I students from music programs.  Additionally, qualitative data were collected from an open-ended question at the end of the survey.  The methodology used for the quantitative and qualitative data enabled the researcher to conduct a statistical analysis that directly addressed the research questions.     Findings. Data analysis revealed that overall, Title I student participating in music enjoy a dramatically higher proficiency rate on the California Standards Test (CST) and California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE) than Title I students not participating in music.  Additional data demonstrate that teachers and administrators agree that the study of music is important, music ""connects"" student with school, nonproficient Title I students who are struggling in mathematics should not be pulled from music for supplemental instruction in mathematics, and nonproficient Title I students who are struggling in English should not be pulled from music for supplemental instruction in English.  Teachers and administrators, however, disagreed that the involuntary exclusion of nonproficient students denies them their right of equal access.  Qualitative themes that emerged were dropout, opportunity, intervention, self-worth, and accountability.     Recommendation. The recommendation for further research is that it should focus on replicating this study in other Title I areas with music programs.",0
Development of an instrument to measure high school students' global awareness and attitudes: Looking through the lens of social sciences,"The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument to measure high school students’ perspectives on global awareness and attitudes toward social issues. The research questions that guided this study were: (a) Can acceptable validity and reliability estimates be established for an instrument developed to measure high schools students' global awareness? (b) Can acceptable validity and reliability estimates be established for an instrument developed to measure high schools students' attitudes towards global social issues? (c) What is the relationship between high school students’ GPA, race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, parents’ education, getting the news, reading and listening habits, the number of classes taken in the social sciences, whether they speak a second language, and have experienced living in or visiting other countries, and their perception of global awareness and attitudes toward global social issues.    An ex post facto research design was used and the data were collected using a 4-part Likert-type survey. It was administered to 14 schools in the Miami-Dade County, Florida area to 704 students. A factor analysis with an orthogonal varimax rotation was vii used to select the factors that best represented the three constructs – global education, global citizenship, and global workforce. This was done to establish construct validity. Cronbach’s alpha was used to determine the reliability of the instrument. Descriptive statistics and a hierarchical multiple regression were used for the demographics to establish their relationship, if any, to the findings.    Key findings of the study were that reliable and valid estimates can be developed for the instrument. The multiple regression analysis for model 1 and 2 accounted for a variance of 3% and 5% for self-perceptions of global awareness (factor 1). The regression model also accounted for a 5% and 13% variance in the two models for attitudes toward global social issues (factor 2). The demographics that were statistically significant were: ethnicity, gender, SES, parents’ education, listening to music, getting the news, speaking a second language, GPA, classes taken in the social sciences, and visiting other countries. An important finding for the study was those attending public schools (as opposed to private schools) had more positive attitudes towards global social issues (factor 2) The statistics indicated that these students had taken history, economics, and social studies – a curriculum infused with global perspectives.",0
INSTRUMENTENKARUSSELL (CAROUSEL OF INSTRUMENTS) - THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN EARLY CHILDHOOD MUSIC EDUCATION AND INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC TRAINING,"Summing up, a form of Instrumentaler Orientierungsunterricht (""instrumental orientation class"", as it was called by Franz-Michael Deimling when he founded this course at the music school Plön in 1983) or Instrumentenkarussell (""carousel of instruments"", which seems to be the more common name nowadays) is indeed the missing link between early childhood music education and instrumental music training. A look at the internet shows that more and more music schools in the German-speaking countries are offering related courses, but this growing demand is not yet reflected in the curricula of future instrumental teachers. Therefore a survey about the various forms of these courses, their claims and standards, their impact on children's future music training would be helpful. A variety of further teaching aids with distinct aims should reflect those differentiated needs; the teachers who practice these concepts should be encouraged to publish their ideas, experiences, and materials. And last but not least, these courses should be established as part of musical training in the important first phase of music education. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
Study of the Rhythm of English Language in Its Nursery Rhymes,"The first section of this research tries to examine a few of the most frequently proposed definitions for the nursery rhymes of English language and for the ""comptines"" of French. From this presentation, it appears that the nursery rhymes on their whole are not primarily meant to make up sport teams among young children neither for their enjoyment. The second section introduces the classic work of Iona and Peter Opie. According to these two specialists, it is important to find out the most ancient and first mention of each nursery rhyme studied in an historical and social approach. Such a research was popular at the beginning of the 20th century. The following section introduces a different approach for the English oral nursery rhymes. It considers them as the genuine representatives of the rhythm of spoken English. Then both Sections 4 and 5 try to develop and illustrate such an approach for spoken English rhythm. Finally the last section is dedicated to the establishment of the physicophysiological background of the rhythm of English language in its nursery rhymes. Adapted from the source document",0
Using Song Lyrics in the Preschool ESL Classroom to Assist Students' English Vocabulary Retention and Use,"The purpose of this 5 week study was to determine if the introduction of English words to ESL preschool students in the form of song lyrics would increase the students' English vocabulary retention and their use of 20 target English words. The intervention took place in an ESL preschool classroom with 15 students aged 4-5. Each week during daily large group instruction time, a song which incorporated 5 of the target vocabulary words was introduced and learned by the students. The students were then observed later in the day during free play by the teacher/researcher in order to record instances of target word use. Weekly journal pictures and dictations were also analyzed for frequency of target word use. Data collected demonstrated that the preschoolers did indeed learn the target English words and used them during free play. There was an increase in knowledge of all target words with percentages between 6 to 80 percent. Concrete words were learned at higher percentages than abstract words. In addition, analysis of the journal pictures and dictations showed that students were incorporating the new vocabulary into concepts they already knew. Use of singing songs to promote English vocabulary in these ESL preschoolers was determined to be a motivating and effective teaching strategy.

what I did on my summer staycation,"During our visit to Egypt, I had an excuse to wrap my kids in toilet paper and make them into mummies. This was a treat for all of us- they're as obsessed with death as were the ancient Egyptians, and were mystified by and enamored with the ancient burial rituals and ceremonies. We wrote our names in Egyptian hieroglyphics, made masks to celebrate Carnival in Venice, painted hollow eggs in Russia, tried our skill .at block printing in India, made a small-scale English garden- in short, we tried our best to be as active as possible in each country. We tried our hand at archery in England, conducted a mini Tour de France bicycle race, and even made our own popsicle-stick boats to re-enact Italy's boat races. While in Guatemala, we learned that most ofthat country's volcanoes are dormant- but one of our library books told us how to create our very own active volcano. Ours erupted often, to applause and laughter.     Being in the right place at the right time helps, but there's something to be said for making the moment. Downtown we found a lovely French café, with tables set up on a pedestrian street and the owner's children playing outside. We took the largest table available, quickly made friends with the youngsters, and ordered frog's legs, a huge dessert, and many spoons. Everyone gathered about as my children tasted the frog's legs. Only one loved them, but the other two soon realized that eating dessert was contingent on devouring the amphibian. That done, the spoons were passed around, the dessert was savored, and the conversation continued. Our new friends sang us French songs they'd learned in school, and answered our questions about their life in France. Thanks to the warmth of these youngsters and their eagerness to share their experiences, we all enjoyed our afternoon in France.     Throughout our entire global escapade, I was with camera. I documented our adventures with snapshots, and kept a travelogue so that we can enjoy our journey again and again. We'd made a replica of the flag of each country we visited, and these still hang in our hallway as reminders of the places we've been. The children were so excited by our staycation that they've already begun choosing the countries they want to visit next summer.",0
"Small-Town Perspectives, Big-Time Motivation: Composing and Producing Place-Based Podcasts","The research conducted by site participants investigated the effects of place-conscious instruction on students' performance.\n It was always a good story, especially when it came to fishing tales, so we rarely discouraged him; if only he could put such enthusiasm and storytelling skills into his writing.  Because the Rural Voices project provided him an opportunity to share his tale orally, he was willing to write out his story as part of the process.  In this particular case, the technology was a major motivating factor because he, and those involved in his group, found value in his talent to play the electric guitar, a skill that is often unrecognized in the ""of- ficial"" music classes held in a public high school- and rarely recognized in an English classroom.",0
The Perceived Value of Videoconferencing with Primary Pupils Learning to Speak a Modern Language,"Young modern language (ML) learners' heightened, yet temporary, phonological sensitivity suggests an aptitude for spoken communication with peer native target language (TL) speakers. Opportunities for this can be achieved through videoconferencing (VC). As researcher and specialist teacher at a primary school in England, I undertook a study of VC which aimed both to develop theoretical insights for policymakers and practitioners, and also to provide 'usable processes' associated with design-based research for developing young pupils' ML speaking skills. My challenge in brief weekly lessons was to develop pupils' usual group chanting/singing towards individual speaking in meaningful exchange in twice-weekly VC links with a partner French school. Participants' affective experience was the focus of data gathered from pupils in Years 2, 3 and 6. This article focuses on pupils' and teachers' views of the value of VC for learning to speak French. Pupils tended to see VC as useful for learning to speak French although peer pressure seemed to adversely influence Year 6 pupils' pronunciation. Some pupils of different abilities were highly motivated by their VC participation. Some able pupils' retrospective reflections on the longer-term impact of VC suggested it had been a 'highlight' of their entire primary ML learning experience, and they felt they had increased confidence in speaking as a result. A sample of lower ability pupils also retrospectively expressed a positive view of VC. Adapted from the source document",0
A survey of ICT usage across English secondary schools,The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is a statutory component of the Key Stages 2 and 3 National Curricula in the UK. This research presents findings from a national survey of the availability and usage of ICT in music classrooms within English secondary schools. It also examined a range of issues related to the training and continuing professional development opportunities that teachers utilised to develop their skills in this area. Key findings from the research show that music education is dominated by conservative uses of ICT that reinforce traditional subject content. Rigorous strategies for the sharing of knowledge in this area are needed if wider impact is to be made on the delivery of music curriculum that exploits the broader potential of ICT to widen access and provide students with an inclusive and personalised curriculum.

Scenic Learning in Foreign Language Teaching-Evaluation of a School Trial,"Scenic Learning (SL) is a technique involving choral recitals of vocabulary accompanied by meaningful gestures & movements. This technique was developed & implemented by teachers in a secondary school who used it, for instance, in teaching a second language. This paper evaluates the impact of this technique on memorizing Latin vocabulary (study 1) & on pronunciation in reading a French text (study 2). 137 students in six classes took part in study 1. The experimental group (65 students, grades 7, 8 & 9) acquired vocabulary with the SL technique. After 13 weeks, the scenic learners retained an average of 15 (of a total of 20 words), compared to the control group with only 5.5 of these words. 85 students in four classes took part in study 2. The experimental group (45 students, grades 6 & 7) read a French text with the SL technique. Experts who rated their audio tapes awarded the scenic readers better marks than the students from the control group in regard to pronunciation & other aspects. Both studies demonstrate an advantage of the SL technique over teaching methods without choral recitals accompanied by gestures & movements. Adapted from the source document",0
The Utility of Musico-visual Formats in Teaching/La utilidad de los formatos de interacción músico-visual en la enseñanza,"The paper discusses the educational potential of popular culture through the use didactic formats musicovisual interaction in the classroom. It is believed that popular culture, specifically music, is a particularly useful tool for learning. Considered by learning skills, and its current deployment in International educational systems. Especially, its implementation in the education Systems in Europe and Spanish. We live in a technological society, and therefore it is necessary to extend the concept of literacy to digital literacy. Elements of popular culture that are common for young people, such as video clips, should be incorporated. We analyze the competency learning proposals made by the OECD through the DESECO Project or the European framework defined by the recommendation of the European Parliament and Council. These proposals provide a starting point to establish an initial strategy, from the discursive dimension of interaction musicovisual formats, allowing for effective work in the classroom. For this reason, the article evaluates formats musico-visual interaction as teaching aids to serve a critical digital literacy. It also explores some specific contributions to the development of competencies in compulsory Secondary Education. General proposals are made to enable teachers to understand how to use these formats musico-visual interaction in their classroom to work general competencies. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
The impact of professional staff development on instruction for English language learners,"This quantitative study investigated general education/pullout, bilingual education/ELL, and other teachers' perceptions and attitudes toward the bilingual education/ELL program and English language learners (ELL). In addition, this investigation obtained information on what professional staff development school districts provided to these three groups of teachers to instruct bilingual Spanish English language learners. To obtain this information, a survey was sent to 440 teachers and the response rate was 42%. The sample of 184 respondents taught from kindergarten to 6th grade in two districts located in the suburbs of a large mid-western city. In these districts the three groups of respondents received professional staff development in teaching ELL students in workshops, in-district events, graduate classes, conferences, seminars, and through mentorship. Some of them were trained in ELL awareness of cultural differences, effective practices, language acquisition theory, teaching native language arts, science, social science, math, and teaching English to ELL students. Bilingual education/ELL respondents are more likely than general education/pullout and other respondents to receive professional development. Yet a great percentage of the three groups expressed a need for additional professional staff development. Teachers expressed need for more professional staff development in many areas: teaching native language arts; methods and strategies for hands on science, social science, math, and teaching English to ELL students; how to teach native language arts to ELL students; how to allow ELL students to develop their native language while developing English; and how to mix the ELL students' native language with English while developing English. A very high percentage of respondents in the three groups agreed that the student's use of his/her native language is a tool that transitions and assists the student to learn English. Also they agreed that a more adequate Oral Language Proficiency Test is needed to measure ELL students' progress in speaking social and academic English and their abilities to read and write in English. The three groups of respondents, overwhelmingly use action-oriented activities like total physical response (TPR), field trips, and experiments. Along with these action-oriented activities, the three groups of respondents also use games, songs, rhymes, and chants while teaching content.

The effect of rhythmic teaching methods for kindergarten EFL students in Taiwan,"The purpose of this quantitative study is to investigate the effect of the rhythmic teaching method for English as a foreign language (EFL) to kindergarten students in Taiwan who are naturally acquiring both target vocabulary pronunciation and oral spelling in the English language at the same time. Two hypotheses are used for the study and were tested using the ANCOVA method, in which a (alpha) was 0.05. Two selectively assigned kindergarten groups participated in this study. One was the control group using the non-rhythmic teaching method; the other was the experimental group using the rhythmic teaching method and employing ten color spelling songs as treatments. The researcher utilizes lyrics of colors and music that meet different criteria, including (a) to stay within the Taiwanese kindergarteners' cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains and development, (b) to promote the development of kindergarteners' physical control of ears, fingers, and vocal cords, (c) to use the social and cultural context of the English language, (d) to stay within the child's voice range, one octave from middle C, (e) to follow the goals of English teaching in kindergarten required by the Taiwanese government: to develop cultural learning and international understanding without focusing on developing fluent communicative competence, and (f) to follow the linguistic rules of the English language. The literature is classified into three categories. The experiment and result analysis of Hypothesis One indicates that there is a significant difference in mean target vocabulary pronunciation acquisition by method when controlling for the covariate. The experiment and result analysis of Hypothesis Two also indicates that there is a significant difference in mean target vocabulary oral spelling by method when controlling for the covariate. The investigation contributes to the field of the English language teaching methods and materials for kindergarten EFL students. The researcher recommends that kindergarten teachers need to obtain rhythmic teaching method training before they employ the methods to help kindergarten students acquire the English language.

Learning A Foreign Language Through Chansons,"In order to raise motivation and help students actively partiticipate during foreign language classes, and to make the process more interesting, various methods and materials can be used. Singing songs during classes of all levels is a very successful and popular method because lyrics are remembered easily and singing creates a new and positive working atmosphere. In the introduction the author notes the importance of using songs in teaching with the aim to develop all language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing, as well as practicing grammar and developing abilities for critical thinking and getting acquainted with the elements of French civilization and culture. She also writes about the value of French chansons as a specific form of songs that originated in France. The author further proposes a model of working with the chanson A quoi ca sert l'amour (E. Piaf and T. Sarapo) with high school students (level A2) and concludes with her personal experience of teaching that song to students at level B1 according to CEFR.

CLASSROOM CONTROL on a SCOTTISH READING BUS,"The day I visited, the bus driver parked outside a rural school. There, the children were brought onto the bus by their teachers. The children were filled with surprise, energy and mischief. On the bus, easily big enough to accommodate 25 small bodies and their teachers, we met a guitar-playing teacher and storyteller (we will call her Laura) who was literate in children's songs and Scottish stories with a smattering of Doric words (which she quizzed the children on) and English. Deftly using three chords and a lifetime of experience, Laura enraptured the children and directed their behaviour with song and story, using soft songs (""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"") to quiet the children, and songs with actions (""Don't Push Granny Off the Bus"") to engage their need for movement and memorization.     Now it was time for the Primary One teacher (we will call her Pamela) to get involved. Sternly noting the need for the children to remember the rules, Pamela admonished Child Two for his behaviour, quite ignorant of any superhero powers his [Sam] might be displaying by repeatedly flailing other frightened puppets. Child Two's eyes met his teacher's tone, and he grew quiet. At the same time, Laura reached for her guitar and engaged the puppets and their children in a shaking rendition of an old Shetland saga of a selkie (a mythological seal shape-shifter) who, by unwisely taking off her skin in the moonlight, was tricked out of her freedom and forcibly betrothed to a fisherman. Using her child as a stooge, she eventually found her hidden skin (you should throw the skin away next time, Mr. Fisherman!). Because she had put on a few pounds over the years, she had to shake even harder to put her skin back on so she might escape forever from her children and her duplicitous fisherman husband and return to the sea. (Of course, she graciously provided the family with a fish for every meal from that point on, which, as Laura explained, was welcomed because these were children of a selkie, after all, and fish would always be tasty to them. Obviously, this was a special kind of Shetland family support payment, and no mention was made of the selkie's concern for the fisherman's diet or tastes. Finally, it must be pointed out that no barristers were involved.)     In truth, Pamela would have been neglecting her duty had she not organized her children and taught them the rule of classroom law. And Laura would have been a much less amazing storyteller had she made the children sit and be quiet so that they might earn, through good comportment, the opportunity to enjoy singing and storytelling. That said, the differences between the control systems that shaped these children's lives were so obvious to me, although not at all obvious to the children, that I came to reconsider my work as a teacher educator. Specifically, I started to wonder whether we in teacher education even deign to educate young teachers in the skill set that Laura inherently knows and uses masterfully: she can organize children's behaviour using no force at all. She shares the stage and facilitates activities so that children can have fun. The momentum of her bus- her classroom- was a joy to experience, both cognitively for the children and metacognitively for me as a teacher educator.",0
Aboriginal Issues and the ATA Magazine,"In October 2005, along with 2,500 Grades 4-6 students from schools across the province and an array of presenters, I attended the Aboriginal Education Showcase at Edmonton's Northlands AgriCom. In the Winter 2005 ""Editor's Notebook,"" I wrote of how I (and everyone else in that enormous building) was swept away by the singing of our national anthem by Akina Shirt (a Grade 7 student at the time). Akina sang ""Ka Kanatahk""- ""O Canada"" in Cree, the language of her ancestors.     Finally, in the Summer 2006 issue, I reported on my visit to communities along the southern shore of Lesser Slave Lake. At Kinuso, I stopped at the school and lucked into a lunch meeting with principal George Dashkewytch; Pauline Auger, one of the High Prairie School Division's First Nations and Métis coordinators; and several of Pauline's colleagues. Like many of the schools along the lakeshore, Kinuso School has a high percentage of First Nations and Métis children, and many of the division's programs are designed with them in mind. We discussed holding the next Conference of the Committee on the Well-Being of Children and Youth somewhere in the Lesser Slave Lake ""neighbourhood."" Subsequently, the committee's 2007 conference was held in High Prairie and Grouard, and was put together by representatives from many of the bands and settlements in the area. We titled the event Nihiyawisihtwawin Think Like a Cree.     My thanks to [Andrew], [Margaret] and [Jordan], for their kind hospitality; to Sheena Jackson, for arranging my visit and accompanying me; and to [Clayton Blood], who kindly translated from Blackfoot to English. Thanks as well to Elder Theresa Tuccaro from Fort Chipewyan, who spoke with me for this article. Speaking of her role as an Elder, Margaret told me, ""I have a job to do but I'm not there yet."" Her priority is education for the people in her community, including her 9 children, 29 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. ""My father was always there for me - always supported me and taught me about a good life,"" Margaret said. She continues to be a role model for her community, and she remains actively engaged in promoting education and sheltering the cultural traditions of her people.",0
Orff the Wall: Developing Musical Understanding the Orff Way,"With more than 1,000 tickets sold, the event showcased students from eight Orff-based school music programs in Calgary, including Citadel Park School (directed by Cherlynn Sauter), Catherine Nichols Gunn School (directed by Lori Follis), Dalhousie School (directed by Sue Harvie), Douglasdale School (directed by Bruce Anderson), Marion Carson School (directed by Melanie Draper), Silver Springs School (directed by Feckla Spaulding), Ranchlands School (directed by Lisa Armstrong) and Sunalta School (directed by Heather Nail). Organizational assistance was provided by Elaina Smith, Kate Ceri, Marguerite Boychuk and Elizabeth DiMarino, and the evening also featured special guests Tremolo, a professional percussion group.     Orff Schulwerk, founded by German composer Carl Orff, entered the North American educational landscape in 1924 with a new blend of rhythms, percussion instruments and movement, combined with a return to the child-centred and constructivist educational philosophy of John Dewey. Both Dewey and Orff insisted that skills and knowledge should be integrated into the lives of students so that students would develop critical-thinking skills, as opposed to merely memorizing facts. This is the key to the success of the Orff processthat it is elemental, distilling musical concepts down to their roots, enabling all children to become musically independent thinkers and problem solvers. In a speech given at the opening of the Orff Institute in Salzburg in 1963, Orff (1977) said, ""Elemental music is never music alone but forms a unity with movement, dance and speech."" As students develop their vocabularies in each of these media of music, they become increasingly proficient at performing, creating and listening- all of the behaviours that make up fluency in the language of music.     As musicians and music educators, we know intuitively (and scientific studies on the brain and work in intelligence and music are confirming) that we hold in our hands a powerful tool, a key that may unlock the door to developing the brain's greatest potential (Gardner 1973)- perhaps even the answer that will help humanity thrive with the demands of the 21st century. In the words of big thinker Daniel Pink (2005, 74), ""The MFA is becoming the new MBA."" As Orff educator Joe Berarducci told delegates at the 2006 national conference of Carl Orff Canada, in Toronto, ""Explore, create, discover- everything that awakens and develops the imagination. . . . This is what inspires children to be fully alive through music.""",0
Effect of fixed -do and movable -do solfege instruction on the development of sight -singing skills in 7- and 8-year-old children,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of movable-do and fixed-do solfege instruction on the development of sight-singing skills of 7- and 8-year-old children. The main research question was: What effect does pedagogical approach have on children's sight singing achievement? Participants (N=181) for this study were students from twelve second grade classes from six schools in north central Florida. Four classes from two schools were randomly assigned to Experimental Group One that participated in movable-do solfege instruction. Four classes from two other schools were randomly assigned to Experimental Group Two that participated in fixed-do solfege instruction. Four classes from the remaining schools were assigned to be the Control Group which did not receive any solfege instruction, but participated in other singing and music reading activities. Participants in the experimental groups received solfege instruction for 10 sessions of general music classes, each 20 minutes in length. During the treatment period two different approaches to the solfege instruction were used: (1) movable-do instructional approach, which was based on Conversational Solfege method developed by John Feierabend and influenced by Kodály pedagogy and Gordon’s Music Learning Theory; and (2) fixed-do approach to the instruction based on Russian solfege textbooks by Frolova and Metalidi and Petcovskaya, which are traditionally influenced by French solfège methodology.    The children were individually tested prior to instruction and then again after the completion of 10 sessions. The children sight-sang randomly selected tonal patterns made of syllables do, re, mi and  sol, mi and la. Sight-singing performance was evaluated for pitch and contour accuracy. To control for the effect of developmental tonal aptitude on sight-singing achievement, the Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation was administered prior to instruction. To control for singing voice development, the Singing Voice Development Measure  was administered before and after experimental treatment to find out how the level of singing voice development affects sight-singing performance.    Results revealed a significant improvement in sight-singing achievement for both experimental groups. Children who participated in movable-do solfege instruction demonstrated highest scores on the post-tests and greatest gain in sight-singing achievement. MANCOVA test for total score on sight-singing post-tests revealed a significant effect for the pedagogical approach ( F = 4.24, df = 2, 176, p < 0.05), school (F = 13.98, df = 3, 176,  p < 0.001). Singing Voice Development Measure pre-test ( F = 6.86, df = 6, 176, p < 0.001) and scores on sight-singing pre-test (F = 21.63,  df = 1, 176, p < 0.001). Multiple regression procedures revealed that the number of solfege sessions (p < 0.001), the level of Singing Voice Development (p < 0.001) and scores on sight-singing pre-test (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of scores on sight-singing post-test. Tukey Pairwise Comparisons among pedagogical approaches yielded significant mean differences (p < 0.01) between movable-do and fixed-do pedagogy.",0
FOREST for a classroom,"It's about an hour's trek to the Waldsofa (forest couch), a parent-built circular shelter with benches made of sticks and wood, but there's no hurry. If, on the way, there happen to be slimy slugs to observe or muddy hills to slide down, the journey can take much longer-the children set the pace and the interest level. Along the way, the group stops to enjoy a snack of dried fruit, carrots, nuts, and a drink. There is always singing and laughing, but firm rules as well: no running with sticks, no playing around the fire they'll later build, no wandering out of sight of the group.     Recently, after living for ten years in Europe, our family relocated to the US. Because I am American and my husband is Swiss, we are raising our two sons biculturally and bilingually. I remember traveling by train with my children when we were still living in Switzerland, and sharing a coach with a vacationing American family who were happy to hear some English-speaking children. I encouraged my boys, Milo and Kai (then five and two years old, respectively), to play a game with the other family's son. Though all three boys spoke American English, they didn't speak the same language. My children had no idea who SpongeBob, Pokémon, or the Red Ranger were, and had a challenging time figuring out their new friend's strange TV talk. They were also perplexed by the inflexibility of the plots in the boy's play. His action figures seemed to follow scripts he had heard previously, most likely from a TV show or movie. [Kai]'s attempts to add a new character or plot element-a mountain train, say-or a new, original story line, were promptly dismissed.     Waldkinder more easily become involved in self-directed projects. In one group, a favorite activity was cooking pretend Barlauch soup. Barlauch, a kind of wild leek, is found abundantly in the forest in spring-the kids collected the leeks, built a pretend fire and cooking pot, then chatted endlessly about the necessary ingredients. Without any prompting from the teacher or specially designed instruction materials, they were able to create an experience rich in language, cooperate as they distributed jobs and figured out how best to make the pot, and use their fine and gross motor skills to pick the Barlauch and drag sticks and stones. Meaningful contact with nature supported the children's learning and solving of problems. Waldkindergarten's emphases on respect for nature, survival, and working with others challenge the values of a consumer children's culture.",0

How to Choose a Goose,"Long discusses the universally acknowledged truth that every English-speaking child is the better for an early friendship with ""Mother Goose""--early meaning from birth, because nothing boosts language development better than those catchy rhymes and rhythms. They are essentials of both popular culture and literary heritage; they stimulate young imaginations; reading, saying, or singing them draws parents and children together in shared delight.",0
Evaluating Current Trends in Psychiatric Music Therapy: A Descriptive Analysis,"Approximately 21% of music therapists report working in the mental health field, more so than another other specific client population category (AMTA, 2005). The purpose of this study was to descriptively evaluate psychiatric music therapists and their institutions, philosophies, interventions, and clinical objectives. A survey was designed and posted online or mailed to music therapists who did not have email addresses in the 2005 Member Sourcebook (AMTA, 2005). A total of 176 psychiatric music therapists completed various parts of the survey for an overall response rate of 42.9%. Respondents reported working a mean of 11.3 years in the psychiatric setting, being Board-Certified Music Therapists for 13.3 years, and working at their institution for 8.4 years. Most respondents (90.6%) indicated they did not have a music therapist as a supervisor. Group music therapy was the dominant modality in psychiatric institutions for music therapists. Respondents indicated they read music therapy journals (80%) and other types of psychiatric periodicals (57.1%), presented educational sessions at conferences (44.6%), conducted inservices for hospital staff (64.8%), worked with an interdisciplinary treatment team (77.9%), and trained practica students (43.5%) and interns (37.4%). Respondents also indicated that although most were not bilingual (85.7%), they still worked with non-English speaking consumers (58.2%). Participants noted that they enjoyed working with the psychiatric population and felt they had a positive influence on treatment as indicated by Likert-type scales. Respondents reported using primarily behavioral or psychodynamic approaches but considered their primary psychological philosophy as eclectic. Participants predominantly indicated they addressed goal areas such as socialization, communication, self-esteem, coping skills, and stress reduction/management. Participants noted they employed a variety of music therapy techniques such as music assisted relaxation, improvisation, songwriting, lyric analysis, and music and movement to address consumer objectives. Participants indicated they used therapeutic verbal skills and techniques such as humor, redirection, reinforcement, empathy, and affirmation in their clinical practice. Additionally, the results of this survey were compared to the psychiatric portion of a music therapy descriptive study published in 1979. Similarities and differences are discussed.

NMSU Music Students and Professors Cheered/Inspired in Colombia,"A successful music clinic taught in Colombia two years ago by Frank ""Pancho"" Romero, a professor of trumpet and director of jazz ensembles at NMSU, helped lay the groundwork for last year's trip. In 2005, Romero was alerted to an opportunity to teach in Colombia by e-mails from the National Association for Music Education and ""Jazz at Lincoln Center,"" a not-for-profit arts organization whose mission and purpose is ""to enrich the artistic substance and perpetuate the democratic spirit of America's music."" Both were looking for Spanish-speaking music educators who wanted to teach in South America. Several people, including Greg Fant, head of the music department and associate dean of development for the College of Arts and Sciences, urged Romero to apply. He applied, was accepted, and received funding from the U.S. State Department and Colombian Ministry of Culture to pay for his music clinic.     Even though the U.S. State Department awarded $20,000 to the Symphonic Winds to perform (twice the normal amount awarded), it was not enough. Money had to be raised to take 45 NMSU students and seven faculty members to Colombia. The President's Office, Provost's Office, College of Arts and Sciences, and Department of Music all contributed. Also, the father of one of the NMSU trumpet players wrote a check for $250, telling Romero ""to use it as needed."" Romero said the money was used to tip baggage handlers in Colombia and for other incidental expenditures. Transportation, lodging, and meals in Colombia were handled by the Colombian Ministry of Culture, the city of [Bogot]á's Institute of Tourism and Culture, the Government of the State of Boyaca (where Paipa is located), and the American embassy in Bogotá.     ""They will attend Ken's [[Ken Van Winkle]] conducting classes and some music education classes,"" Romero noted. ""It's a cultural exchange; we're trying to share ideas. Most of the teachers are qualified to teach once they finish colegio, which is equivalent to our high school. So the teachers are only 17 or 18 years old, and they are proficient on only their instruments. You have a trumpet teacher only teaching trumpet students with little or no experience in teaching other instruments or conducting. That's what they'd like to change. They want to give that 18-year-old music teacher further education so she can go out and teach clarinet and flute and saxophone and trombone and the percussion instruments. That's the influence we can have on them; we can help equip these extremely talented people.""",0
EFL listening comprehension strategies used by students at the Southern Taiwan University of Technology (China),"Although English has been a required academic subject for every elementary and secondary school student in Taiwan, Taiwanese college students' fundamental communicational competency in English still needs to be improved for the demands of academic needs and the highly internationalized environment in Taiwan. This situation is especially true at the Southern Taiwan University of Technology (STUT) where the students' EFL listening comprehension proficiency should be enhanced. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in preferred EFL listening comprehension strategies of STUT students who were effective and ineffective EFL listeners. Two instruments were utilized for the research: (1)a test of listening comprehension and (2)a survey questionnaire. The listening test was selected from Longman Preparation Series for the TOEIC Test (1996) and Dr. Huei-Chun Teng's (1998) Questionnaire of Listening Comprehension Strategies was employed as the main survey instrument. The sample for the research was comprised of 494 randomly selected STUT freshman students taking required Freshman English courses. Participants were asked to complete 20 multiple choice questions to measure their listening comprehension effectiveness. The survey used a five-point Likert scale to measure participants' perceived use of EFL listening comprehension strategies. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including frequencies, percentiles, means, composite means, standard deviations, rankings, and a series of independent sample t tests (p < .05). Findings from this study include the following. (1)The 10 most preferred EFL listening comprehension strategies adapted by STUT students included using keywords, taking risks wisely, translating, representing sounds in memory, paying attention, using music, highlighting, associating/elaborating, semantic mapping, and using progressive relaxation, deep breathing, or meditation. (2)STUT students utilized more memory strategies for EFL listening comprehension than any other category of strategies. The utilization of memory strategies was followed by the use of cognitive, metacognitive, compensation, and affective strategies. Social strategies were the least employed. (3)Effective STUT EFL listeners applied more memory, cognitive, compensation, and metacognitive strategies in EFL listening comprehension than ineffective STUT EFL listeners. However, there was very little difference between these two groups in the application of affective and social strategies.

Determinants of EFL learners' derivational suffix knowledge,"How knowledge of derivational suffixes (DS) is acquired in English as a second and/or foreign language has been a neglected area of study. The purposes of this study are to describe how the syntactic knowledge of nineteen DSs has developed in EFL learners' mental lexicon in accordance with their vocabulary expansion, compare the difficulty order of DSs observed in this study with the orders observed in three previous studies, and explore what combination of predictors best explains the degree of difficulty in learning DSs. Participants' DS knowledge statistically significantly correlated with their vocabulary size even after controlling for explicit learning (r = -.45, p < .01), and the order of difficulty determined in the current study correlated with the order observed in Mochizuki and Aizawa (2000) (Rho = -.77, tau = -.66, p < .01) for EFL learners. The knowledge of some DSs, however, did not conform to the developmental pattern of the knowledge of the others, and the order of difficulty observed in this study did not correlate with the order observed in Singson, Mahony and Mann (2000) for L1 children (Rho = -.22, tau = -.21, p = n.s.). A principal component analysis was used to identify six orthogonal predictors suggested by psycholinguistic studies on the mental lexicon and on grammatical category learning. These six predictors explained 83.4% of the variance in the item difficulties of the DSs tested in this study. The predictors were (a)token frequency of semantically transparent derived words, (b)class distinction (whether a DS tends to form orthophonologically transparent derivatives), (c)variants (whether a DS has variants), (d)orthographic ambiguity (frequency of pseudo-suffixed words), (e)verbal DSs (whether a DS forms a verb), and (f)included DSs (whether a DS includes a formal unit corresponding to another early learned DS). The predictors also explained most of the deviations from the general developmental pattern, and the discrepancies between the EFL and L1 data. The findings illuminate how DSs are learned by EFL learners and support connectionist accounts of the mental lexicon.

Music and motivation in the second language college classroom,"This research study investigates qualitative and quantitative data from college students concerning their perceptions of the language learning context and of the affective and cognitive effects of musical modes of instruction in a required intermediate second language course. The study was conducted in two college intermediate-level Spanish classes of which I was the instructor. The specific focus of the study centered on student perceptions of four issues: (1) the current context for second language study; (2) student motivations for second language learning; (3) the value of music activities in building second language skills; and (4) the value of music activities for student participation in second language learning. Music activities used in the class included listening to recorded songs, singing songs, and composing lyrics in the target language to a familiar tune. There were four phases to the data collection: an initial student survey on second language background; a series of daily evaluations of class activities; a motivation questionnaire; and interviews with individual students. The findings from this study indicate that these students live in a society with minimal support for or modeling of second language fluency. For this population second language learning began later than any other core subject in their formal education, usually during middle school or high school. The students have had few opportunities to need or use a second language through travel or everyday experience and there are very few adults in their immediate or extended family that are fluent in a second language. The students showed some consensus in regard to motivations for second language learning. The majority of the students admitted that they would not be taking the class if it were not to fulfill a college requirement. Even though they saw some importance for immigrants to learn English as a second language and believed that Spanish is an important language in the U.S., they did not agree that learning a second language was important for everyone. Although students perceived some value in the music activities for building second language skills, there was a stronger support for the affective effects of the music activities in the classroom. The majority of the students perceived value in the music activities for lowering the anxiety they felt in the class. A higher percentage of students indicated appreciation for the music activities than for the study of second language in general. When asked for the three activities that they most enjoyed throughout the semester, students listed a music activity more than any other classroom activity. The results from this population strongly support the current context for second language learning, including the monolingual nature of the society in which they live, that is set forth in the literature review. The results also show a low level of personal motivation for second language learning on the part of the students. The students indicated strong support for the positive effects of the use of music activities in the second language classroom to encourage student participation in second language reception and production.",0
The Challenge of Creating More Inclusive Public Schools [Building Inclusive Schools],"Kohn (2004) describes the ""collateral damage"" resulting from NCLB in terms of the pressure to segregate schools by ethnicity and ability. He cites a study by Policy Analysis for California Education that found that NCLB ""contains a 'diversity penalty' such that the more subgroups of students that attend a given school, the lower the chance that it will be able to satisfy all the federally imposed requirements for adequate progress"" (Kohn 575). Subgroups include different ethnic groups, students with disabilities or limited English skills, and children from low-income families. Thus, schools serving a diverse student body are more likely to be labelled as ""failing"" under the provisions of NCLB and become subject to a host of negative sanctions as a result.     An education law described as ""no child left behind"" is actually having the opposite effect: leaving behind the most vulnerable students, forcing teachers and schools to abandon creative, effective instructional approaches and practices, and negating what is known about children's learning and development-that not all students learn the same things in the same way at the same pace. Kohn says he has an ""overstuffed file of evidence detailing what we're sacrificing on the altar of accountability, from developmentally appropriate education for little children to rich, project-based learning for older ones, from music to field trips to class discussions.""

The Spandau Model: Simultaneous Early Encounters with English and French,"Following a model instituted at one elementary school in 1998-1999, 15 schools in 10 districts of the Berlin area introduced both English & French in grades 3 & 4 to familiarize students with both languages & thereby to facilitate their parents' choice of an obligatory foreign language for them beyond grade 4. English & French were taught by different teachers on alternate days in 22.5 minute sessions that were embedded in other subjects, eg, music, sports, or mathematics; the experientially oriented learning goals included communication in contexts of play & music, acquisition of basic vocabulary, development of listening comprehension, & imitative speech with adequate pronunciation. Positive attitudes towards French are reported from Baring's classroom after completion of the teaching model, although the majority of parents selected English for their children's obligatory foreign language.

Communication and Text: The Place of Written Language in German as a Second Language Instruction in Primary Schools of Geneva,"The role of texts in second-language teaching methods is examined in light of current developments in the school systems of the French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, where a course in German at the primary level that emphasizes the development of oral skills in preparation for transfer to written language skills has been replaced by a three-volume method named ""Tamburin,"" written solely in German & intended for students from any language background in grades 3 & 4. Designed in the framework of communicative language teaching, ""Tamburin"" integrates written language from the beginning in the form of verses, songs, & short reading texts; listening & reading comprehension strategies are developed simultaneously in language activites oriented towards the experiences & interests of the students.

The Effects of Selected Music and Songs on Teaching Grammar and Vocabulary to Second-Grade English Language Learners,"The quest for stricter accountability measures placed on public schools throughout the United States has led legislators and educators to use standardized test results as a major determinant of student and school success. Unfortunately, this way of thinking brings about instruction that is focused solely on test-taking practices and not on effective teaching and learning practices. The time constraints that come with excessive testing do not allow the incorporation of music and songs in the delivery of instruction. The rationale for this study was based on the concept that listening to and participating in music activities in class increase motivation for learning and reduce anxiety, thus creating the optimal environment for learning grammar and for vocabulary memorization. This study used music and songs to teach selected grammar and vocabulary to second grade English as a Second Language students for a six-weeks period. The subjects who participated in this study were 28 second grade elementary school students divided into two groups, the control and experimental groups. Most of these students were Hispanics who spoke Spanish at home, and who had been placed in a bilingual program at school. The researcher conducted the experiment and taught English as a Second Language (ESL) in two second grade classes, composed of fourteen students in each group. The class designated as the control group was taught English grammar and vocabulary using traditional methods of instruction, while the other class, the treatment group, was taught English grammar and vocabulary utilizing selected music and songs in addition to the traditional method. The control group improved its overall average of Pre-Post test grammar and vocabulary scores from 72.8 percent to 83.7 percent. The treatment group's overall average score improved from a pre-test score of 65.7 percent to 90.2 percent on the post-test. Overall, the control group in the experiment had a 10.9 percent gain in its average score at the end of the six-weeks period, compared to the 24. 5 percent treatment group gain in average score during the course period. In general, the results indicated that music and songs can be an effective instructional supplement to teaching English grammar and vocabulary to second grade students. In the study the thirteen songs and three musical stories for the elementary level allowed students to learn with optimal results. The results of the experiment seemed to indicate that music and songs can be used to improve grammar and vocabulary skills for second language learners.",1
The strength of children's knowledge of the role of root morphemes in the spelling of derived words,"The spelling of words in English is governed in part by the morphemes that make them up. This study examines the strength of children's knowledge of the role of root morphemes in spelling, specifically focusing on whether it can withstand interference by phonological changes. A total of 75 children between seven and nine years of age were given the first parts of two-morpheme transparent and opaque derived words (e.g. musical and objection) and one-morpheme control words (e.g. metal and portion). Children used the clues to a significant extent with the two-, but not the one-morpheme words. This effect was consistent across age groups and across both types of derived words. This is evidence that children's understanding of the link between morphemes and spelling is not impeded by changes in the sound of morphemes. These findings have substantial implications for models of spelling development and for educational practice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
A Comparison of English Listening Beliefs and Strategy Use of Taiwanese University Students and Teachers,"Listening plays an important role in language learning in the development of speaking, reading and writing. This survey study investigated the English listening comprehension beliefs and strategies of a group of students and teachers in Taiwan. Two self-report questionnaires, Listening Comprehension Beliefs Questionnaire and Listening Comprehension Strategies Questionnaire, were administered to 515 university students and 10 teachers from the same university in Taipei, Taiwan. The data were analyzed by percentages. The results indicated that the majority of teachers and students held the same beliefs such as some people have better aptitudes for language learning, the importance of good pronunciations and vocabulary knowledge in comprehending listening texts, and the benefit of prior knowledge. However, there was a discrepancy between the teacher group and student group on the importance of understanding the English-speaking culture. While all the teachers believed that understanding the culture would help with the acquisition of the language, only about half of the students (55%) agreed that it was necessary to know the culture to learn the language. Both students and professors employed a variety of listening strategies, with some strategies receiving more frequent use than others. Some of these frequently used strategies included guessing, creating association, use of previous knowledge, and grasping the overall ideas. The student group (77%) reported that the translation strategy was used extensively, whereas the teacher group (10%) did not recommend this strategy during listening. The student group (41%) tended not to think in English, while the teacher group (90%) perceived this as a good strategy to better comprehend input. The student subjects also suggested beliefs and strategies which were not addressed in the questionnaires. These beliefs included the use of English songs and video as teaching materials (4.7%), studying English with native speakers (19%), and that younger children were better language learners than adults (4%) and so on. Concerning the strategies, the ""practice"" strategy (26%) was strongly recommended by the student subjects. The students indicated that ""practice"" helped them achieve mastery, regardless of what strategies they used. This study provides a better understanding of listening beliefs and strategy use of teachers and students. Based on the conclusions drawn from the results of this study, future research should replicate the study with high-school or junior-high school students and teachers as participants. For English teaching it is suggested that teachers should offer more opportunities for students to practice in and outside the class, and adapt teaching materials to students' goals and interests. It is recommended that students and teachers create learning environments that foster confidence in language learning, especially environments that are free from anxiety and pressure.",0
"'What we're doing, we do musically': Leading and managing music in secondary schools: EMAL","In English schools, many responsibilities have been delegated downwards to middle level leaders. National standards for subject leadership assume that middle leadership skills are generic and the literature largely agrees with this view. This article presents data from the first pilot enquiry within ARTSLAMP (Arts Leadership and Management in Schools Project), launched by the authors in summer 2003, which challenges this assumption and suggests that there may be differences in skills required for leading and managing different subjects. It draws on interviews with four subject leaders of music in secondary schools. Participants were asked about their roles and responsibilities, professional development and perceptions of the requirements of their jobs, specifically focusing on subject specialism. They identified several ways in which they perceived their leadership and management roles to be uniquely linked to their specialist subject. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
The Effect of Chanting Activities on the Comprehension of English of First Graders and College Freshmen in Taipei,"This study investigated the effect of chanting activities on the English listening comprehension of ESL students in Taipei. The chanting activities were developed using existing themes from the ESL classroom. Songs were selected based on specific criteria. While chanting was the focus of the lessons, singing was encouraged but not required. Two experiments were conducted with different age populations. Experiment one included a population of first grade children. A quasi-experimental design was used. Nineteen songs were selected as the treatment. Students were exposed to forty minutes of English instruction per week for eighteen weeks, for a total of twelve hours of class time. Data was obtained from 56 subjects in the treatment group and 57 in the non-treatment group. The assessment tool for experiment one was developed by the author. Ten questions were included. The focus of testing was the listening comprehension of vocabulary. Findings indicated that: (1) chanting activities increased vocabulary comprehension; (2) chanting activities affected vocabulary comprehension positively in nouns and verbs; (3) frequency of occurrence of target words affected vocabulary comprehension for elementary first graders. Experiment two was conducted using a population of college freshmen. Data was collected from 31 subjects in the treatment group and 31 in the non-treatment group. Treatment for the experiment was ten songs. The assessment tool consisted of 30 questions from a TOEFL listening comprehension practice examination. Data from this study led to the following results: (1) chanting activities increased listening comprehension for college freshmen; (2) chanting activities had the greatest impact on the grammatical categories of perfect tenses; (3) although chanting activities can affect both children and adults positively, the effect on the younger subjects was greater than on the older students; and (4) the effect of chanting activities on listening comprehension of vocabulary for the first graders was greater than on the comprehension of grammatical structures for college freshmen.",1
False Accents: Embodied Dialects and the Characterization of Ethnicity and Nationality,"[...]we did not see Chinese Americans picketing because Filipinos and Filipino Americans were cast in leading roles in David Henry Hwang's adaptation of Flower Drum Song.     [...]a child born into a family that speaks with a Scottish or Welsh accent will hear, copy, learn, and reproduce speech sounds in the Scottish or Welsh mannerby using the vocal apparatus in such a way that the muscle movements assume an automatic pattern when a word is spoken, and a firm speech habit is created that for the majority of people is the one they will use for the rest of their lives.     [...]the selection of dialects and accents was based upon professional demand as indicated by the number of plays or roles requiring a particular variety of the English language as pronounced by native or non-native speakers.     [...]of the extensive immigration of the past several decades, it is already possible to cite many instances where what once would have been perceived as an unrealistic or ""unnatural"" matching of body and accent has become or is in the process of becoming a common phenomenon.",0
Bilingualism and Identity: A Sociolinguistic Study of Native Spanish-Speaking Children in an Agricultural Community in California,"This sociolinguistic study focused on the relationship between proficiency in English as a second language and identity, for native Spanish-speaking children in an agricultural community in California. The expected results were that there would be a strong positive correlation between the two main variables in the study - English proficiency and identity. Data was drawn from 41 subjects, who were generally grouped into three age groups: six year olds, eight year olds, and ten year olds. The range of grammatical features that were operationalized as English proficiency reflect deep structural differences between Spanish and English; these features cover syntactic configuration (Noun-noun compounds), morphological attachment (tense doubling), as well as several different functions of a core grammatical element (articles). Identity was operationalized as a bundling of social factors - a constellation of symbolic information, and preferences, focusing on the following 5 general categories: Favorite food(s), favorite music, sports, holiday foods eaten by the family, preference for place - Mexico or the local California community. In addition, participants were asked about any English-only speaking associates they have. Scores were derived for both variables, which were then correlated. The results obtained from the correlation analysis were not as expected. The results showed very little correlation: (.119). Given these unexpected results, separate ANOVAs were run on the sub-categories of the identity variable and English proficiency, with the aim of identifying trends in the data. Not one of these ANOVAs was significant. However, one of the sub-categories of the identity variable, ""number of English-only speaking associates"" showed somewhat significant results (0.076). This sub-category, referred to as EO, was reconsidered as a measure of social networks; as such, it appears to be a good predictor of English proficiency, similar to several other factors used in this study - age, sex, and SES - all of which are large group identity factors. Ethnolinguistic identity theory emerges as important to the discussion of the results of this study; this theory claims that people in a subordinate group will hold on to their ethnolinguistic identity, if certain conditions exist. One of these conditions, ethnolinguistic vitality, is a measure that is based on several components, including (1) demographic strength (group numbers, birthrates, migration, concentration and distribution in the community), (2) institutional support for the language (in the education system, the media, the government), and (3) status (social, political, economic, linguistic prestige). Given the demographic data presented in this study, as well as the descriptions of the educational support programs available within the school district (bilingual and migrant programs), combined with the results of this research, it would appear that the ethnolinguistic vitality of these participants is high, resulting in these participants holding fast to a Mexican-oriented identity. The question of how this vitality affects whether or not these children become fully proficient in English is a matter for future research.",0
Spanish Language Shift in Chicago,"Over 800 Latino high school & college students in Chicago, Illinois, reported via a written questionnaire that they used Spanish 75% or more of the time with their parents & other adults in the family. However, Spanish use with siblings, friends, cousins, & their own children averaged just 45% & was negatively correlated with length of residence in the U.S. This combined with overall low levels of daily Spanish use point to a language shift to English. The factors that appear to hold back a complete shift to English include positive attitudes toward Spanish, allegiance to Spanish-language music artists, reported high levels of Spanish proficiency, & the recontact opportunities offered by the influx of young Spanish-speaking immigrants to Chicago. 19 Tables, 56 References.

With references made to English courses in German elementary schools, it is shown how grammar knowledge is indispensable to developing learners' communicative & linguistic competence. It is observed that grammar gives a communicable form to linguistic & cognitive contents: semantic elements by themselves cannot shape the formal structures underpinning a successful transfer of thoughts & meanings. In early second language instruction, grammatical forms & meanings should first be presented receptively as chunks (rhymes or fixed text portions) & only later analyzed & consciously reprocessed in training & drilling. Grammar teaching is especially effective when language reveals itself to children in concrete, interesting, relevant, & clear contexts. Young students will understand that grammar is useful & necessary when they see that it gives meaning to the rhymes & songs they learn. Students should also be introduced to some linguistic terminology of grammatical concepts. Z. Dubiel",0
CONFESSIONS OF A MOVIE EXTRA,"I didn't bomb English (or at least not that I know of). When Mr. O'Malley approached me, he said, ""Are you auditioning?"" I wasn't too surprised to hear him say that because, along with being an English teacher, Mr. O'Malley directs our school plays. In March, I starred as Kim in Bye, Bye Birdie. The whole time onstage I kept thinking about how someday, when I'm a celebrity and E! is interviewing me about my early acting roles, I'll be able to reminisce about high-school musicals.              ""You'd better hurry up,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""Auditions are in the gym at 3:15. They're casting local teens as extras -- football players, cheerleaders. No speaking parts, and it doesn't pay, but it'll be lots of..."" Before he finished, I sprinted toward the nearest bathroom, clutching the lipstick.              ""Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for the world."" My mom sets the camera in the grass and gives me a hug, even though I'm disgustingly sweaty and she's in a nice suit. ""I'm sorry I haven't been around that much lately,"" she says.",0
"Relationships between pitch-matching accuracy, speech fundamental frequency, speech range, age, and gender in American english-speaking preschool children","This study is an investigation of the relationships among acoustical measurements of pitch-matching accuracy, speech fundamental frequency, speech frequency range, age, and gender in preschool children. Consideration was taken in applying known research concerned with the anatomical characteristics of the developing child voice to see if a relationship between the acoustic findings and anatomical structure and function was evident. Participants in the study were 70 English-speaking children, ages 36-71 months, from three geographical areas of the United States. Subjects were asked to engage in directed and spontaneous speech activities and short echo-singing activities. All speech and singing data were taped and subsequently analyzed for fundamental frequency (Fo) using the Cspeech acoustical voice analysis program. Results revealed (a) both speech Fo and speech range were the overall strongest predictors of pitch-matching accuracy (p < .0001) and (b) that age in months was a significant predictor (p = .03) of the ability to sing the lower pitches (C and D) used in the study. Gender also emerged as a significant predictor of pitch-matching accuracy, but not as strong as speech fundamental frequency or speech range. The acoustic findings supported, previously established research findings concerned with child vocal anatomy and function. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
Heritage Learners in the Polish Language Classroom,"The Polish competence of three generations of heritage learners enrolled in an introductory Polish course at a New Zealand university (N = 13) is described in the framework of Sarah Surus's (1985) description of Polish in New Zealand & recent studies identifying linguistic features typical of different stages of language attrition. Generation 1A, who had most or all of their primary education in Poland, display active & passive proficiency with gaps in both grammar & lexicon; generation 2, exposed to Polish from birth though educated in New Zealand, have passive knowledge of Polish & tend to overrate their active ability, which may be limited to greetings, prayers, & songs; & generation 3, with Polish-born grandparents, have limited passive & no active proficiency. Phonological, syntactic, & lexical features of New Zealand English influence on Ss' Polish speech are detailed; Polish morphology is in a process of simplification in generation 1A & has been reduced to an analytic structure in generation 2. An instructional focus on contrasts between English & Polish is recommended, with treatment of similarities as exceptions & a preliminary explanation of differences between synthetic & analytic typology. 30 References.

The Development of Tense and the Present Perfect in Second Language English,"Empirical research into how people establish knowledge of second languages (L2s) beyond childhood has shown an indirect link between the input they are exposed to and the knowledge they attain. It has also shown that development across learners is typically systematic and knowledge can also be considerably underdetermined by input. However, L2 speakers often have persistent difficulty with certain grammatical properties, even with ample evidence in the input. Explaining why learners develop knowledge systematically and why some properties (but not others) remain problematic is one of the aims of L2 research. In recent work, several explanatory theories have emerged, but it is relatively difficult to find evidence to decide between them. This study looks for evidence that might narrow down these alternative accounts. The predictions of six current theories are compared, in the domain of the L2 acquisition of English tense and aspect distinctions, specifically focusing on the contrasts between the present (e.g. I walk/sing), the preterit (e.g. I walked/sang), and the present perfect (e.g. I have walked/sung). Controlled comparisons are made between proficiency-matched speakers with typologically different first languages (Chinese, Japanese, German), and performance is examined at four linguistic levels: the morphosyntactic, the syntactic, the semantic, and the pragmatic. The results suggest that three of the hypotheses are untenable as explanations and two provide partial accounts for the development and ultimate attainment of tense/aspect distinctions by post-childhood L2 speakers. Compatible with the sixth account, the results strongly point to the following conclusion: Adult L2 learners have access to the computational resources of the morphological and semantic components of the language faculty, and it is the deployment of these that gives rise to systematic development. However, establishing the syntactic representation of tense/aspect features is problematic, if these are not instantiated in a speaker's first language, giving rise to persistent difficulty.",0

Factors Related to Persistence in the Study of French at the College Level,"The current study was conducted to address the problem of declining enrollment in French classes. The purpose was to identify those factors that are responsible for student persistence in the study of French beyond the level required to obtain a general degree from the University. Research questions included the following topics: (1) students' perception of their motivation for language learning, (2) the relationship of certain activities, the classroom climate, the role of the teacher, & the use of technology, to their motivation for language learning, (3) reasons students give for not continuing with their foreign language studies, & (4) factors language majors & minors attribute to the decision making process that led them to continue with the advanced courses. Using an emergent case study design, the researcher surveyed & interviewed French 102 students & French majors & minors. Classroom observations & a focus group meeting were conducted as a way of triangulating the data. Participants attributed their motivation primarily to two factors: the value of knowing a second language & the beliefs they had developed regarding language study. Beliefs included notions such as the extensive time & study commitment needed to effectively learn a foreign language & the age at which students best acquire language skills. In terms of the French classroom environment, students indicated that any materials other than the textbook were the most motivating & beneficial, including the use of games, songs, & varied media forms. They also stressed the importance of the professor in motivating students. The most non-motivating activity was anything that was required; students insisted on the need for choice in their assignments & content. Students were somewhat indifferent about the use of technology in the French classroom, perhaps because their use of technology was extremely limited. Further research is recommended in the areas of foreign language teacher education & the use of technology in the foreign language classroom, as it becomes more widespread. In addition, research is suggested at the secondary & middle school level, where students may acquire some of the beliefs alluded to during this study.",0
"Putting It in Perspective: Pennsylvania High School Teachers, Content Area Reading, and Standards","With the January 1999 adoption of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening Standards, Pennsylvania teachers will now be accountable for incorporating content area literacy (CAL) skills to enable students to meet the new standards. The purpose of this study was to identify Pennsylvania high school teachers' (a) beliefs about readers and reading in the content area classroom, (b) level and quality of preparation in content area reading, (c) familiarity with the mandates of the new standards, (d) beliefs about important instructional practices, and (e) attitudes towards CAL skills. A 55-question survey was distributed to Pennsylvania high school teachers in two schools (N = 128). Respondents comprised 11 subject areas (art/music, n = 7; business/word processing, n = 3; English/language arts, n = 33; family & consumer science, n = 3; foreign language, n = 8; health/physical education, n = 5; mathematics, n = 17; science, n = 17; social studies, n = 17; special education, n = 11; technology education, n = 7). Scores were calculated for four grouped subscale theme areas in the survey including (a) reading beliefs, (b) important teachers' instructional practice, (c) students' content area reading skills, and (d) importance of CAL training. Three separate Pearson product-moment correlations revealed significant positive relationships between teachers' beliefs about reading and their perceptions of important instructional behaviors and practice (r = .33), between their perceptions of important student reading skills and teacher practice (r = .61), and between teachers' reading beliefs and the need for CAL training (r = .45). A chi-square analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between teachers' subject area (English/Non-English) and their level of familiarity with the standards (chi-squared = 12.30, p less than .05); English teachers demonstrated a significantly greater familiarity. Results revealed that teachers recognize the need for adequate and high quality preparation in CAL despite the fact that a majority of teachers (68.6%) rated their own preparation as fair or poor. There was strong agreement that the skills required in the Pennsylvania Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening Standards are valuable and that teachers must aid students in achieving success in acquiring CAL skills.",0
Melodic Contours as Signalers of Illocutionary Force in the Discourse of the L2 Teacher,"L2 teachers often have difficulties in communicating successfully in the target language with students who have poor transitional competence. However, in a previous study, Fonseca & Cuenca (2000) observed that it was possible for a native English teacher to communicate with seven-year-old beginners whose mother tongue was Spanish by using a type of simplified code created to help the hearer to learn & understand language. One of the features identified in that code was the use of exaggerated melodic contours to show the teacher's illocutionary intention. The main purpose of this paper is to present the results of the analysis of the speech melodies used by twenty native & non-native teachers teaching English as a foreign language in Spain. This research is based on findings in first language acquisition papers that argue that those melodic contours, identified in child-directed speech, are used intuitively by parents to guide their babies' musical beginnings (Papousek, 1996), but also as a species-specific learning guide to language (Snow, 1972; Stern at al., 1982; Papousek, 1994; Feu & Pinero, 1996). The conclusions of this study imply that the prototypical contour variations found in the data are based on shared knowledge between teachers & students. Adapted from the source document",0
The Use of Poetry in TEFL: Literature in the New Lebanese Curriculum,"In this paper, I demonstrate how the analysis of the language of poetic selections could be the basis for TEFL lessons. To illustrate, I use sample selections from the poetry of two Lebanese-American poets namely Ameen Rihani's The Chant of Mystics & Gibran Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Nowadays, more arguments support the relevance of using literature to the teaching of a foreign language, & discuss the usefulness of the linguistic analysis of literature for pedagogical purposes. The New National Curriculum of Education put into effect in Lebanon beginning academic year 1998-1999 differs radically from the old one in methodology, approach, & distribution of cycles. The new curriculum adopts the content-based approach, which allows for the possibility of using literary texts as one source of content. My major focus in this paper is on the use of poetry in the secondary cycle of the Lebanese English curriculum. The poetic selections handled are rich in their vocabulary & structures, which allows for a variety of activities. Whether we are teaching a foreign language or even a native one, literature is a highly recommended vehicle for a number of reasons. In such cases, focus on the language paves the way for a meaningful & rewarding literary appreciation. 21 References. Adapted from the source document",0
Phonological Awareness and Reading Development of Young Japanese Learners of English,"Written language originated as second-order system to represent spoken language. Many L1 studies have reported on the causal relationship between phonological awareness and subsequent reading development. It is the author's main research aim to investigate the validity of these L1 findings in the L2 context. This dissertation reports on three studies conducted by the author to examine the relationship between English phonological awareness and English reading ability of Japanese children who learned English as a foreign language. The first study investigated the effect of nursery songs on the development of English rhyme awareness among 62 five-year-old Japanese children. It was found that it was possible to measure the rhyme awareness of preschool learners and that the children could learn rhymes and develop their rhyme awareness in class. Since one group receiving nursery rhyme instruction showed statistically significant gain, it is suggested that nursery rhymes are useful in increasing rhyme awareness among Japanese L2 learners, which is consistent with findings in L1 studies. The second study was a cross-sectional correlational study involving 700 Japanese elementary school children from the first to sixth grades who learned English at school. This study investigated the relationship between English phonological awareness, which was measured by syllable and rhyme detection abilities, and English reading development. Path analysis showed that syllable awareness influenced rhyme awareness but that only rhyme ability was a significant predictor of success in word recognition and reading ability. The last study investigated the effect of English phonological training on the development of English phonological and/or reading skills among 357 Japanese elementary school children from the first to sixth grades who learned English at school. The children in the experimental group received sound training and those in the control group watched English videos. The participants in the experimental group showed more gain from the treatment, although there was no significant difference between the groups, probably because of the limited training time. The pedagogical implications of these studies are discussed, particularly regarding the importance of integrating sound training into EFL classes.",1
Language-Based Spelling Instruction: Teaching Children to Make Multiple Connections between Spoken and Written Words,"Two studies addressed issues related to multiple instructional components in early intervention for at-risk spellers learning to spell polysyllabic words. The first study was a follow-up to a prior second-grade intervention. The fast responders in that study, who were monitored at the beginning and end of third grade (n =61), maintained their earlier gains during third grade when treatment was withdrawn. Thirty-two of the slower responders received continuing tutoring (12 individual tutorials over 6 to 8 weeks in late fall of third grade), which showed that children who received only alphabet principle training did as well as those who received combined alphabet principle and syllable awareness training (syllable types in English), but that these children required 24 practice trials for short-term mastery of spelling specific words. The second study with a new sample of 48 third graders also evaluated the effectiveness of alphabet principle training only versus combined alphabet principle and syllable awareness training. In these 24 individual tutorials over a 4-month period beginning in the fifth month of third grade, the combined treatment was more effective for (a) spelling untrained transfer words, (b) spelling taught polysyllabic words with a final, silent e syllable, and (c) transfer to phonological awareness. A two-tier model for early intervention to prevent spelling disabilities is proposed. In the first tier alphabet principle is taught (along with other sound-spelling connections for words including syllable awareness) and applied to practice in spelling words singly and in text (teacher-directed dictation and child-generated composition). In the second tier children are monitored in the year following early intervention and continuing tutoring is provided if necessary.",0
Rhythmic Structures in French Sign Language (LSF) Nursery Rhymes,"Research over the past three decades has brought attention to various ways in which linguistic structures are exploited to build poetic form in sign languages. These include recurring patterns of phonological elements (similar to rhyme, alliteration, or assonance) that play a role in the structure of verses & strophes, as well as uses of metaphor & modifications of the form of signs that contribute to an overall fluidity of movement distinct from non-poetic signed discourse. In this paper we concentrate our attention on the role of rhythmic structure & the ways in which it interacts with syntactic structure to build poetic form. Our data consist of nursery rhymes, either original LSF creations or adaptations from French nursery rhymes, which were composed by Deaf adults & children. This type of poetry, as a genre of oral literature, is essentially performance-related & is highly variable in form. Despite the difference in modality (oral vs gestural), LSF & French nursery rhymes show similar characteristics (repetition of phonological units, non-significant gesture, & similar subject matter), & rhythmic structure is central to their overall structure. This paper isolates rhythmic templates in LSF nursery rhymes via the analysis of accentual prosody (speed, intensity, & manner of movement) & compares the nursery rhymes with an equivalent corpus of non-poetic performances. This research is relevant to the question of the university of infant rhythmic structure & the importance of nursery rhymes in first language acquisition. 3 Tables, 11 Figures, 18 References.

Language Learner Perceptions of Strategy Use in Secondary Schools,"Research involving secondary schools in Spain, Italy, & the UK & carried out within the Socrates/Lingua European Cooperation Project, is discussed. Teachers (N = 93) were asked to list activities used in their classroom & to identify strategies they thought their students used in second language learning. UK learners of French, German, Spanish, & Italian (N = 607) & Spanish & Italian students of English (N = 461 & 546, respectively) were interviewed & administered Likert-scale tick box questions to determine the use, preference, & frequency of various learning strategies. It is found that teachers often confused learning strategies with teaching strategies, & listed memorization & repetition as the most common learning strategies. Students' survey revealed that memorization, repetition, self-testing, textbook/exercise-book reading, & silent practice dominated as the preferred learning strategies; however, listening to English pop songs rated second as a learning strategy for Spanish & Italian respondents. Gender differences, self-monitoring, vocabulary learning techniques, & motivation factors are discussed. 1 Table, 24 References. Z. Dubiel",0
Outcomes of an Enhanced Literacy Curriculum on the Emergent Literacy Skills of the Head Start Preschoolers,"Children who attend Head Start are at risk of reading difficulties and school failure due to socioeconomic disadvantage. This study examined the effects of a twelve week supplementary classroom literacy program on the emergent literacy skills of Head Start children. Ten classrooms of four year olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition which involved the supplementary curriculum, or to a control condition which involved the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention classrooms received direct and explicit instruction in prereading skills which was delivered very systematically through developmentally appropriate practices. Children were pretested and posttested on a variety of language, literacy, and memory measures. Effects of the intervention were significant in the area of phonological awareness. Children's linguistic skill in recognizing and manipulating the phonemic segments in words was enhanced through activities, games, children's songs, and book reading involving rhyming, alliteration, and phoneme blending. Children in all classroom showed substantial improvement from pre- to posttest on letter identification, letter-sound correspondence, word identification, and print conventions. Language of origin (whether participants spoke English or were bilingual) also affected performance on some of the measures. English speaking children tended to perform better on alliteration and phoneme blending tasks than bilingual children. An apparent language effect was also found on a measure of sentence memory. Results from the study have important implications vis-a-vis the controversy over the kinds of experiences children should have in their early schooling. This study demonstrates that direct and explicit classroom instruction which promotes phonological awareness and precursor reading skills can successfully occur at the preschool level in a developmentally appropriate manner. Thus, it provides information and guidance to practitioners about creating preschool opportunities for lower-income families that support literacy development and that address reading risk factors.",0

An Ear for Music as a Condition for Successful Learning of Russian Speech,"A survey was conducted in which Polish students of Russian as a second language in an elementary & music school (N = 34 each) were evaluated for musical abilities & performance in the target language regarding pronunciation, accentuation, & intonation. A high degree of correlation between musical hearing & linguistic proficiency in these three categories was found & confirmed statistically with Spearman's correlation coefficient. It is concluded that good musical hearing (1) helps with the acquisition of segmental & suprasegmental elements in second-language learning, (2) supports the acquisition of listening comprehension skills, (3) leads to better reading aloud, & (4) assists in the discrimination of sounds in the first & second language & subsequent avoidance of phonetic interference errors. 4 Tables.

Nursery Rhymes in English as a Foreign Language University Pronunciation Courses,"The introduction of nursery rhymes into university English as a foreign language pronunciation courses, especially those for future English teachers, is discussed. The properties of nursery rhymes are analyzed as to pronunciation & features of connected speech, & it is shown that nursery rhymes are appropriate for practicing rhythmic patterns, bearing in mind the differences of the patterns in rhymes & in connected speech. Rhymes do not help in understanding intonational patterns, but they are invaluable for practicing linking, elision, weak forms, & the pronunciation of individual sounds in their phonological context. Nursery rhymes lend themselves easily to repetition, providing a natural situation for numerous repetitions of a particular feature. Also, introducing nursery rhymes into teacher training courses keeps students informed about the lore of nursery rhymes in English & provides them with appropriate materials for their future work with children. 13 References.

Processing Constraints in Child Foreign Language Acquisition,"The effects of processing limitations on children's first-language (L1) speech comprehension, L1 speech production, & foreign-language (L2) acquisition were investigated both synchronically & diachronically. Synchronic data consisted of performance results on a set of tasks (picture description, noun recall & recognition, & question comprehension) designed to assess linguistic functioning at a specific point in time. Diachronic diary data were collected from the same subjects (N = 4 native-Polish-speaking children, aged 5-8), who received English as a foreign language instruction in the form of storytelling, roleplays, games, songs, & other activities geared toward children. A review of research into the nature of linguistic processing constraints suggests that ""processing capacity"" consists of both storage space for working memory retrieval & operating space for processing that retrieved material. Data analysis identifies six areas where L2 learning can be affected by a paucity of processing space. (1) Performing a particular task can shift attention away from short-term memory to the task being performed. (2) The strategy of focusing on key words must be relearned. (3) The processing strategy of substitution has to be relearned. (4) Utterance length is restricted. (5) Recall cues can extend utterance length. (6) Processing constraints may interfere with monitoring utterances. A preliminary typology of memory-related language acquisition phenomena is proposed based on these findings. 4 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 33 References. C. Brennan",0
FLAME-Foreign Language Alternative Mastery Example: Another Approach to FLES Models Currently in Use,"A description of foreign language alternative mastery example (FLAME) as an articulated foreign language in the elementary school (FLES) model based on collaborative efforts from kindergarten-university sources & parental support. Two salient features of the model are its unique schedule as an extracurricular alternative (meeting once a week for 11 60-minute sessions each term) & the collaboration of FLES student teachers with a mastery teacher from the university language department. The FLAME methodology includes short songs based on the weekly theme, game playing, team work related to vocabulary themes, & imaginative play with role play & puppets. Important results of FLAME include its means to compensate for budgetary deficits (via the scheduling alternative) & the integration of a teacher training program to the instructional phase. A comparison with Gladys C. Lipton's (1994 [see abstract 9704617]) foreign language exploratory experience (FLEX) model highlights FLAME's emphasis on a broad vocabulary base related to the students' everyday environment & on a reduced emphasis on verbs & conjugation. 6 References.

From the Elementary School,"The importance of songs & song-related activities (dancing, singing, movement) in early second language learning is stressed, & the methdology of working with songs in French as a second language courses in German elementary schools is discussed. Drawing on personal didactic experience, suggestions are offered for the selection of songs, topics, & the training of the four linguistic skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, & writing) while having fun with singing & dancing. A list of sources where suitable songs can be found is compiled. Z. Dubiel",0
"""Dime un cuento/Tell Me a Story"" (LAC in English 385: Children's Literature)","An undergraduate course in children's literature, under the auspices of the Languages across the Curriculum program at State U of New York at Oswego is described. During the semester, participating students (N = 5) read three Spanish-language picture books, a book of nursery rhymes, & a novel. The difficulty of choosing & acquiring appropriate children's books written in Spanish is discussed. Participants gained from learning about other cultures' (eg, the Miskito Indians of Nicaragua) creation myths & current events at the border of Texas & Mexico; presentations based on the Hispanic nursery rhymes were enjoyable for the entire class. In addition to improving their language skills, students discovered that translations are sometimes done poorly; thus, they learned that translations of any kind must be read with an alert mind. 8 References.

Culture and the Curriculum in the Elementary School Foreign Language Classroom,"Culture & language acquisition are closely linked at the elementary school level, with the former dependent on the latter. Children in intensive foreign languages in elementary school programs will therefore develop more linguistic & cultural knowledge than students taking less intensive foreign language exploratory or experience courses. Foreign-language instruction in general relies heavily on the thematic unit, which provides a framework for the students, & it is suggested that thematic units refer to cultural symbols, products, & practices. A focus on literature & social studies is deemed helpful for transmitting cultural knowledge, & it is noted that increased cultural knowledge helps achieve the wider scholastic goals of global education & cross-cultural awareness. The use of music as a teaching tool is also discussed. 37 References. D. Weibel",0
Pictorial and Musical Art in Foreign-Language Education,"Possibilities of using pictorial & musical art in foreign-language education are discussed within the framework of an ongoing comprehensive research project on process-oriented application of media in foreign-language (English, French, or German) education conducted at various universities in northern Germany & the Goethe Institutes in Bordeaux & Poitiers, France. Distinctions between process- & communication-oriented approaches toward art as educational material are outlined, focusing on the emphasis on receptive as well as productive skills in the process-based approach; reception-based art theory, psychology of music, observation theory, hermeneutics, & cognitive psychology are identified as primary theoretical bases of the project. Focal points of the project are discussed, emphasizing the intercultural experience that can be conveyed through art, the triggering of affective as well as cognitive elements through art, the need for students to discuss art in metaphors & thus acquire new skills, & the emphasis in musical art on instrumental rather than lyrical art forms. 56 References.

Waldorf Schools: Seventy-Six Years of Early Language Learning,"The history, curriculum, & methodology of the Waldorf elementary school foreign language program is presented drawing on interviews with teachers, the secondary literature, & attendance at an intensive summer workshop conducted by master foreign-language teachers at the Waldorf Institute of Sunbridge College. Waldorf education is described as the fastest-growing independent school movement in the world, one which is infused with the educational philosophy of Austrian educator Rudolph Steiner. Steiner's conception of foreign-language teaching is portrayed as a holistic pedagogy based on the developmental stages of childhood. The foreign-language curriculum is composed of instruction in two languages involving techniques such as choral repetition, recitation, & the gradual introduction of vocabulary groups & phrases. Other techniques involving story-telling, content-based instruction, reading & writing, & dramatization are also discussed. It is suggested that certain features of the Waldorf approach stand out as particularly important to its effectiveness: the teaching of two foreign languages to all pupils from the first to eighth grade; the oral/choral methods in early years; the delay of writing, reading, & formal grammar; the introduction of writing & reading through oral materials; & the imaginative use of authentic cultural materials. 5 References.

American and British English: A Conflict for the Young Swiss?,"Third-year high school students (N = 37) in the French-speaking portion of Switzerland were surveyed regarding their contacts with British & American English. A four-part questionnaire included (1) recorded samples of British, American, Scottish, & Indian English to test Ss' ability to distinguish & identify varieties of English; & (2) a 15-item sentence completion task testing preferences for British vs American vocabulary. Ss were also asked about the orientation of English in their schooling, travel, language use, reading, listening to music, & watching TV & films. Results show that the English Ss are exposed to in both schooling & travel has a strong British orientation, whereas Ss encounter British & American English roughly equally in all media. Although most Ss recognize American English, vocabulary preferences are British except for movie, highway, & garbage/trash can; similarity to French words did not influence Ss' choices. 2 Appendixes, 9 References.

History and Theory of the Politics of Culture: Some Recent Books,"Halker has three agendas in this study: to correct the canon of folk ballad as established by James Francis Child by opening the working class to significant attention by folklorists; ""to expand knowledge of the musical and poetic history of the working class;"" and to use the songs and poems of the working class as a lens through which to view the world of work and labor protest in the Gilded Age. Through his study of the conscious, attributable works of American ""songpoets"" from 1865 to 1895, Halker seeks to counter the institutional/organizational approach to labor history that focuses only on the actions of ""wage-conscious workers seeking redress for capitalism's abuses."" The poems and songs of writers like Rees E. Lewis, Maggie Linn, I.G. Blanchard, and Rev. Jesse H. Jones suggest to Halker that there was another ""labor question"" for workers ""wherein craft heritage, masculinity, religion, revolutionary principle, common sense, and morality coalesce[d]."" Halker carries on his discussion in the contexts of the history of the workers' movement, formalism, Republican ideology, religious sensibility, and the commodification of mass culture.     This volume, along with Edwin Rolfe: A Biographical Essay and Guide to the Rolfe Archive at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (same editors and same publisher), suggests the rewards of combining archival scholarship with critical inquiry. Nelson and Hendricks obviously benefit from Illinois's acquisition of the Rolfe papers a few years back. They include in this collection the complete texts of Rolfe's three published books of poetry plus three groups of uncollected or unpublished poems placed chronologically after each of the published books to maintain some temporal order. The editors omit poems, published or unpublished, that predate Rolfe's maturation as a writer, although they do reproduce some samples that prefigure significant elements of his later work in a section of ""Early Poems."" Appendices deal with Rolfe's poems in Spanish translation and his longer piece, ""The Sixth Winter."" Nelson's fifty-two-page introductory essay, ""Lyric Politics: The Poetry of Edwin Rolfe,"" is biographical, historical, and, to a lesser extent, interpretive. The three major phases of Rolfe's poetry (the Depression, the Spanish Civil War, the HUAC hearings) are placed in the contexts of his life and of the historical record. At the end of the essay Nelson appreciates Rolfe's eloquence in the production of ""a progressive poetry written in the midst of history, written on our behalf with our common history in view.""     As Jack Conroy's literary executor (Conroy died in 1990), Wixson has a world of material at hand. From it he fashions a biography of Conroy in social, historical, and literary contexts and seeks to ""reclaim"" other midwestern radical writers, printers, and editors. Wixson particularly wants to examine the condition of and contradictions in the career of the ""worker-writer."" To carry this out, Wixson oversimplifies somewhat the matter of ""proletarian"" literature, as when he suggests that internal politics of the left were more destructive to worker-writers than the ""inattention and indifference of the bourgeois press."" Because of his interest in the significance of Conroy's career rather than in the life itself, the biographical focus of the book necessarily centers, in the first sixteen chapters, on Conroy's first thirty-five or so years, such that the last fifty years of his life are covered in the last three chapters. Wixson provides ample and informative notes that draw on the Conroy papers at the Newberry Library, a wonderfully rich collection, and the indexing is generous and well structured for both student and teacher. The bibliography does omit at least one interview and one biographical essay with which I am familiar.",0
Popular Music in a Whole Language Approach to Foreign Language Teaching,"Integrating music & song into a whole language learning environment offers many educational advantages. Song lyrics are linguistically authentic cultural texts that can serve a variety of educational purposes. In addition to familiarizing students with cultural themes & values, songs can serve as a primary vehicle for teaching a foreign language by improving listening comprehension & building vocabulary. Because of their versatility & scope as an educational tool, foreign language songs may be successfully included at any level of instruction. Two sample thematic units incorporating songs for French & Spanish, respectively, are included. 6 References. A. Andersen",0
Techniques of Oral Work for Sensory Integration of a Foreign Language,"The use of rhythm & music to stimulate sensory receptors is advocated in foreign-language instruction for improved integration of the target language, as language acquisition is held to be based on sensory memory & language learning, on intellectual memory. Techniques using body movement patterns, gestural symbolism, sensory automatisms, & musical logic are described. Choreographed interpretations of short texts in French, Spanish, & English are presented. Interpretive principles are applied to games of improvisation, & training techniques are outlined. Levels of application of this methodology range from preschool to college. 24 References. J. Hitchcock",0
Writing? An Aid to Oral Communication,"The introduction of writing into foreign-language (L2) classrooms for children is discussed, based on the psycholinguistic natural approach method. It is suggested that incorporating writing into the lesson helps to reinforce acquisition of the L2. It is pointed out that children already have made a connection between written & spoken words in their native language & therefore can transfer this notion into the L2. Examples of cases in which writing is supportive in the classroom include song lyrics & pictures hung on the wall. A suggested array of activities is included, presented as first & second year levels. Goals such as sensitizing the students to the L2 culture & writing system are presented & it is suggested that introduction of writing helps the student gain more confidence in using the L2. M. Castillo",0
Safeguarding Our Programs through Public Awareness,"Several studies have suggested that second-language (L2) programs must be offered in elementary schools, & then must be maintained by keeping the public aware of the goals of the language program. The teacher's responsibility includes enlisting community support for the elementary school L2 programs & it is proposed that by interesting parents in their children's language programs, teachers can gain valuable parent advocates. Four techniques are described to increase community awareness of language programs, with examples from personal experience in Spanish language classes: (1) a PTA (Parent-Teacher Assoc) program featuring traditional American songs & dances translated into Spanish & performed by the students; (2) encouraging reporters from local newspapers to cover school language program events; (3) distributing vocabulary newsletters to students' families with phonetic pronunciation guidelines for parents who want to understand what their children are learning; & (4) displaying classroom projects & materials during open house so parents may see what their children have accomplished in the language program. 5 References.

"""A Finger to Taste,"" Using Poetry to Teach/Learn a Language at Nursery School","An activity in a submersion/immersion learning environment provides a didactic model for learning a second language in a situation of ""exolinguisme"" (N = 30 Spanish-speaking children in a French nursery school in Saragossa, Spain). Students participated in a traditional language activity of French nursery schools: learning a poem with songs & nursery rhymes. The activity was performed before the noon meal when all the class gathered to sit around the teacher. Various aspects of the activity are examined. Learning a poem, particularly in a second language, requires that the teacher anticipate a direction or plan of progress, taking into account the difficulties the children would experience with comprehension, memorization, & production. 9 References.

Assessing L2 Competency in Early Immersion Classrooms,"Reported is a study exploring the use of puppets & classroom-based interview protocols as a practical way for teachers & researchers to obtain feedback on young students' learning in second-language (L2) classrooms. Receptive L2 competence was explored by evaluating what kindergartners retained & understood of songs, routines, rituals, & structured vocabulary activities in L2. Ss were students in a French immersion kindergarten in Alberta, Canada. Both production & comprehension protocols are described. It was found that students used sequencing of classroom events to help them make sense of L2 activities, & that they focused on teacher-expected behaviors associated with particular contexts in which the L2 was used. Children showed some awareness of the meaning of individual words & were beginning to develop an interlanguage. Implications for second-language instruction are discussed. 2 Tables, 21 References.

Replies on Foreign-Language Instruction from Grade Three,"Replies to two articles by Gudrun Bahls (see LLBA 25/3, 9105106 & 9105436). In ""Fremdsprachenunterricht an Grundschulen""(Foreign-Language Instruction in Elementary Schools), Heinrich Schrand advocates a new structuring of foreign-language teaching methods to meet the needs of basic schools, with freedom from pressure to achieve, motivation to learn, & acquisition of communicative abilities as basic concepts replacing grammatical rules, homework, & grades. Norbert Lademann, in ""Mit welchem Konzept?"" (With Which Concept?), criticizes Bahls's theses, identifying her ""foreign-language concept"" with that of Russian instruction in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) & pointing out the lack of a unified ""Federal Republic concept."" GDR teaching methods produced unacceptable stress on students & cannot be used in early foreign-language instruction. In ""Spielerische Begegnung oder Leistungsorientierung?"" (Playful Encounter or Performance Orientation?), Martina Gocht cites recent research & Austrian & Swedish experience in early foreign-language instruction to support the view that a child's first encounter with a foreign language should enlist the child's readiness for play, song, speech, & role-playing, & that to accomplish this, traditional grammar instruction with homework & grades must be avoided. 9 References.

Drama in Kindergarten French Immersion-Tu blagues!,"After reviewing past research in support of the use of drama with Anglophone children in French immersion kindergarten, a word of guidance is provided for teachers wanting to apply this philosophy. Emphasis is placed on the gradual progression of dramatic task difficulty. While continually keeping the group's response focused on one stimulus, each successive task must accompany the childrens' vocabulary acquisition & their socialization in French. From nursery rhymes, jazz chants, individual interaction with a group, repetition of stories, & songs, to an actual play, the children's creative side can blossom & their linguistic skills can grow. 16 References.

Different Approaches to a Theme and a Dramatic Text in French as a Foreign Language Instruction,"Described are both student-generated skits & work on scenes from modern literary works. Participants (N unspecified) were students of French as a foreign language in grades 7-10 of two German secondary schools (Gesamtschulen). Exercises are outlined that serve as practical methods of improving foreign-language proficiency, focusing on expression. Shopping dialogue, completion of a song, anticipated encounters, & creation of a character are specified tasks. Adaptations of F.

"NEW ANALYSES IN ROMANCE LINGUISTICS: SELECTED PAPERS FROM THE XVIII LINGUISTIC SYMPOSIUM ON ROMANCE LANGUAGES URBANA-CHAMPAIGN, APRIL 7-9, 1988","This vol in the Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science series contains an Introduction, Chpt summaries, II PARTS, & 20 Chpts & consists of papers selected from those given at the Eighteenth Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages held 7-9 Apr 1988 at U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PART I - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY - contains Maria Carreira - The Acquisition of Spanish Syllable Structure - applies a universal grammar framework, using the subset principle & the linking constraint, to the reconstruction of syllable structure acquisition phases in children learning Spanish (data from the Stanford Child Phonology Project); Christiane Laeufer - Syllabification and Resyllabification in French - uses spectrographic analysis of experimental French data to argue that, whereas in slow speech lexical syllabification is determined by phonotatic constraints, the postlexical syllabification of rapid speech is determined only by sonority-based constraints; Jean-Pierre Y. Montreuil - Length in Milanese - bases a reinterpretation of the strong rhyme condition on a moraic analysis of Milanese vowel length; Yves-Charles Morin - Old French Stress Patterns and Closed Syllable Adjustment - adduces evidence from thirteenth-century Old French biblical glossaries, written in Hebrew script, to argue against the attribution of the modern [(schwa)/(epsilon)] alternation to closed syllable adjustment; W. Leo Wetzels - Contrastive and Allophonic Properties of Brazilian Portuguese Vowels - analyzes the Brazilian Portuguese (BP) feature ATR (which distinguishes stressed mid vowels) as a marker on the morpheme & discusses changes in BP feature geometry motivated by nasal assimilation; & Uthaiwan Wong-opasi - On Deriving Specifiers in Spanish: Morpho-Phono-Syntactic Interactions - applies lexical phonology to the derivation of Spanish definite article forms, extending the analysis of demonstratives & the scope of apocope & epenthesis rules. PART II - SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS - contains Philippe Barbaud - Subjunctive and ECP - distinguishes three classes of French subjunctive: (1) selective, depending on a lexical head & satisfying government conditions; (2) induced, triggered by grammatical elements & satisfying c-command conditions; & (3) illocutionary, controlled by a modal element. Obligatory pronominal obviation in subjunctive clauses is linked to empty element licensing; Georg Bossong - Differential Object Marking in Romance and Beyond - argues from Romance & Semitic data that when the phonological distinction between subject & object marking is lost, languages tend to reinstitute differential marking of objects based on factors of inherence, reference, & constituence, & that such marking is diachronically stable; Hector Campos & Paul Kempchinsky - Case Absorption, Theta Structure and Pronominal Verbs - investigates subject generation & accusative case absorption in Spanish & Italian pronominal (""inherently reflexive"") verbs in light of issues in government & binding theory; John E. Joseph - Latin Prepositions and Romance Syntax - traces the development of prepositions from Proto-Italic to Modern Romance languages, showing that their proclisis & increasingly wide distribution motivated the development of obligatory proclitic determiners & clitic pronominals; John M. Lipski - In Search of the Spanish Personal Infinitive - examines the origin & motivation of Spanish lexical head + infinitive constructions, relating their derivation to that of the Portuguese personal infinitive; Patricia V. Lunn - Some Stops on the Modality Line - presents an analysis of scalar modal meaning in the assertiveness continuum of Spanish past subjunctives in -se & -ra & the conditional; diachronic considerations are also addressed; France Martineau - Clitic Climbing in Infinitival Constructions of Middle French - contends from sixteenth-century French data that clitic movement is dependent on the INFL node of infinitival clauses, which L-mark verb phrases in Old & Middle, but not Modern, French; Elizabeth Pearce - On Comparing French and Italian: The Switch from illum mihi to mihi illum - examines changes in the structure of French & Italian, relating them to early & later pronoun order changes in pre- & postverbal contexts; Maria-Luisa Rivero - Exceptional Case Marking Effects in Rumanian Subjunctive Complements - shows that subjunctive clause subject noun phrase movement & case-marking phenomena in Balkan languages, eg, Romanian Am vrut pe cineva sa citeasca cartea 'I wanted somebody to read the book', are due to morphological properties of the inflectional system (Modern Greek & Romanian data are analyzed); Yves Roberge - On the Recoverability of Null Objects - argues that arbitrary null objects as in Italian questa musica rende pro allegri 'this music makes one happy' are made available as a generalization of nonimplicit null objects (eg, lai-vedo proi 'I see her'); data from Italian, French, Spanish, Arabic, & English are analyzed; Mario Saltarelli - VP-Nominative Constructions in Italian - argues against the interpretation of Italian as a split-ergative language based on the surface syntax of piacere 'to like' constructions; Basque data are also analyzed & current case theory is questioned; John Charles Smith - Thematicity and ""Object""-Participle Agreement in Romance - introduces the concept of th-role strength to account for instances of past participle nonagreement with a direct object (when agreement is expected) & agreement with an indirect object; data are drawn from Occitan, Engadinish, Italian, & French; James Hye-suk Yoon & Neus Bonet-Farran - The Ambivalent Nature of Spanish Infinitives - shows that verb classes condition both the appearance & the inversion & auxiliary requirements of infinitival clauses with lexical subjects in Spanish, Italian, & European Portuguese; & Laurie Zaring - Deriving Expletives as Complements: French Ce - accounts for the distribution of French expletive ce by the interaction of the empty category & case resistance principles & the permissibility of filling a th-position at D-structure with a nonargument linked to an argument.

Curricular Programming for Bidialectal Education: Teaching Standard English to Non-Standard English Speakers,"Described is an aural-oral approach to help nonstandard-English-speaking pupils. Activities at the primary, middle, & secondary grades are given. Primary grades focus on oral elicitation of language, spontaneous activities, group speaking & singing, listening/discrimination, & vocabulary-building exercises. Middle grades emphasize individual & group assessment, oral drills, & choral & dramatic activities. Secondary grades use extensive oral drills, competitive & dramatic activity, participatory ceremonies, & school-wide participation for peer approval. Acquisition of Standard English is essential for fuller participation in the culture mainstream. 4 References. J. Mayberry",0
Dramatization of Poetic Texts in the SGAV Methodology (Children 5-10 Years Old),"It is argued that every child, regardless of his/her cultural background, can identify with poetic texts that express universal emotions & actions. The dramatization of these texts is very challenging & useful in the structural-global audio-visual (SGAV) teaching procedure, as the articulation of speech sounds by children is greatly helped if it is supported by rhythmic movements of the body & musical stimulation. It is shown how the dramatization of some traditional English nursery rhymes, songs, & poems encourages children to take an active part in language learning, & sustains this involvement by stimulating attention & providing interesting material. The dramatization provides a context for vocabulary building, reinforces the learning of selected language structures, & familiarizes children with elements of English oral culture. Z. Dubiel",0

Language Choice in Bilingual Classrooms,"Stated objectives for language choice (50% Spanish & 50% Eng) in 5 bilingual kindergarten classes are compared to actual %s of Spanish & English used by teachers & children. The amount of teacher talk was also compared to pupil talk, including both ""free"" pupil responses & choral responses. Functions of teacher lang, eg, warming & accepting, directing, & correcting children, were also examined according to language used. Both the concurrent translation & the alternate days models were observed. With the former: Eng was used by bilingual teachers over 70% of total class time; Sp-speaking pupils responded with similar language choices; teacher talk comprised 80%-85% of classroom talk; & English was the usual choice for warming or accepting the child's contribution, directing, & correcting the children. In contrast, the alternate days model generated an equal distribution of Spanish & English by teachers & children overall, with more Spanish used for warming & directing, although English was the primary choice for correcting. An alternate periods lang format in an open classroom is suggested as the ideal bilingual situation. 6 Tables. Modified HA",0
"Class Libraries 1. For the Child, French as a Foreign Language",Books for children studying French as a foreign language are few in number. A selection has been made from books with simple vocabularies intended for French children. The annotated bibliography includes short descriptions of books in the following categories: dictionaries; reading books with scientifically selected vocabularies; academic reading books; reading books intended for very young children; & songs.

Teaching Modern Languages Across the Ability Range,"The coincidence of vertical & horizontal expansion of language teaching has resulted in a critical shortage of French teachers, particularly those equipped to teach the less able pupils. This brings up the questions of ""Why teach foreign language to less able students?"" & (if we decide to try) ""How should we do it?"" Less able children should be taught a foreign language because experience has shown that with the use of appropriate methods, they can be taught these communication skills, & that even when partially scucessful the study of a foreign language is an important element in a program of verbal education. Every child requires this program but the less able among our pupils have special need of it. Critics who suggest that at present a lot of time & effort is being wasted at the expense of other opportunities are quite right. Unless a better method of foreign language teaching can be found, it is probably wisest & kindest to give up the struggle. For those schools having the resources to offer language study to all pupils, the use of effective teaching & appropriate methods is discussed. An important quality that disadvantaged pupils lack, namely, insight into pattern in learning, is very important in language learning. Teaching strategies must deliberately set out to help pupils grasp the pattern of what they are learning. In order to enhance extrinsic & intrinsic motivation the teacher must find ways of keeping each step in learning ""new but not too new"" & of challenging pupils with incongruities that are not too dissimilar from previous experience. By utilizing music teaching methods the French teacher can help educate the student's ear. Another problem the less able pupil has is his short term memory (STM). If pupils cannot hold a new string of more than 3 or 4 items in STM long enough to repeat the string back, they cannot make any link with items already in the longer term store. For their benefit, care must be taken to present new material in shorter pieces. The following suggestions are made for the teaching program: (1) Individual attention is necessary & may be accomplished by group work, intensive remedial sessions, & use of teacher aids; (2) Links with schools abroad should be nurtured; (3) Pupils from French or German schools should spend a term in British schools as ordinary members of the class; & (4) The class should visit France during its 5th year.

English in all the classes? English at the international school in Heidelberg,"International groups of students learning English together is discussed. A program of teaching English as a foreign language at the International School in Heidelberg is described, in which children of many nationalities are in classes together--one seventh of these children do not speak German as a native language. Instructors decided that the children needed a common language in which classes could be taught and in which the children could communicate in and out of school. In this way, nationality barriers could be broken. English is the chosen common language, since there is such a great demand for this language in the business world. The students were taught English via games, singing songs, reading stories, and practicing grammar. When students got older, all of their classes were in English. The students not only shared a common language (and so were brought closer together), they also developed a greater competence in English than students who merely learn English as a foreign language.

English in Brazil,"English is the dominant foreign language in the Brazilian secondary school curriculum, with French as a rather distant second offering. The fact that most Brazilian teenagers like modern American music and American movies has always served as a motivational factor for learning English. Not to be minimized is the future need for English in almost all areas of professional activity. It will be taught increasingly on all levels; some attempts are now being made, especially in the larger cities, for an earlier introduction in elementary schools which can both plan and offer a longer English program extending through high school. It has always been in great demand in specialized institutions such as the Yazigi School Network, as well as the Binational Centers and British-Brazilian Institutes. A considerable number of teachers of English graduate from Brazilian universities every year, and in addition, there are seminars for secondary school teachers held every year under the auspices of State Departments of Education and specialized organizations. The teacher training programs organized by Yazigi's Center of Applied Linguistics have proven successful in helping teachers become familiar with a methodological approach based on the harmonious blending of such elements as English, pedagogy, psychology, audiovisual technology, informal learning, and humor. The underlying principle of the Yazigi Method is that learning English can and should be both relevant and fun. A great variety of textbooks for learning English is available including the Yazigi series and books from abroad. A significant example of binational cooperation is the ""International Examination of Operational Competence in English Program"" which has already helped to certify the proficiency of many Brazilians in English. The task of the EFL teacher in Brazil is being made less difficult by such pioneering initiatives as that of the Yazigi Institute, an organization which tries to keep up to date with developments in the U. S. and Great Britain.",0
The teaching of English to 3 and 4 year olds,"A description of personal practical experience in initiating young Spanish-speaking children in the art of speaking English at the Bideleux Studio and the Montessori School in Olivos, Buenos Aires. After the first year in primary school, the children had acquired very little new English, had forgotten much that they had previously learned, and no longer seemed to enjoy English. Differences in the methods in kindergarten and primary school are considered the cause of the reverse reaction in the children. It was discovered that in regard to the primary school: (1) The Teacher's Training Colleges in Buenos Aires prepare teachers for children only as young as eight years old; (2) There is little or no material available for the guidance of teachers; and (3) Most programs for young children are adaptations of those designed for older children. English programs were introduced that include as many songs, verses, dialogues, and acted scenes as possible to provide vehicles for communicating with children. The children started using the language as a means of expressing what they were doing--""living"" the language--instead of having it presented in an artificial manner. It is necessary to make a clear distinction between programs for three and four year olds; three year olds can only be given an introduction along general lines, while four year olds can be introduced gradually to easy structures, which, through repetition with vocabulary, can be considered the start of systematic learning. Even with four year olds, however, progress must be slow and interspersed with games and fun. Thus, fun and laughter should be the keynotes of the lesson. If the children have not enjoyed learning it, they will immediately build up a resistence to the language. AA",0
Teaching English to first-graders in Belgrade,"Six years ago, the Pedagogical Institute of Belgrade established an experimental foreign-language program for first-grade children. As the traditional age for beginning a foreign language in Yugoslavia is 11 or 12, the new project, offering English, German, French, or Russian, included the first four primary grades as well. To initiate the project, it was necessary to deal with such problems as curriculum changes, lack of teaching staff, and suitable teaching materials. To fit the new subject into the first grade curriculum, parts of other syllabi (nature and social studies, physical education, drawing) were worked into the language program. In the belief that an open-minded approach would be crucial to the success of the program, young university graduates who were fluent in the target language but lacked teaching experience were selected as teachers. For the initial oral period, special teaching materials provide for a year and a half of exclusively aural-oral work, the length of this period determined by the fact that Belgrade school children learn the Cyrillic alphabet before the Roman. English is used excusively in daily 45 min classes. Structures and vocabulary are carefully selected and graded for presentation at a pace which is manageable for most of the children. To help maintain interest and motivate large classes of about 30 students, the materials include games, rhymes, stories, dialogues, and songs. The sections taken from the other syllabi also suggested ways for the children to learn through activity, i.e., they are told to fly like birds, jump like rabbits. The topics of the lessons also come from the nature and social studies syllabus. In an attempt to prevent both teachers and students from inventing nonidiomatic constructions, the materials have been constructed so that on the left-hand side of the page the teacher finds everything he is expected to say and do, and on the opposite side of the page everything he is supposed to elicit from the students, either in chorus or individually. An early drawing lesson is given in an appendix as illustration. As the gradual expansion of the program is some measure of its success, Belgrade's experiment and experience might be of interest to others. AA",0
Michigan oral language series (English as a second language or second dialect),"A generally favorable review of a bilingual program which stresses the regular early childhood curriculum as well as standard language skills. Activities include language games, play activities, songs, and stories. It was prepared for four to six year old children of migrant workers in the Midwest whose language background is Spanish. Its aim is to teach Standard Spanish and Standard English. Concepts are introduced in Spanish and then retaught in English. The series consists of a set of guides: the bilingual preschool guide; Spanish and English Kindergarten Guides; and a lengthy four part guide called Primary 1. The guides include: (1) a description of the goals of the program; (2) suggestions for classroom techniques and time scheduling; (3) the sequence of language and concept skills; (4) an equipment guide; and (5) an art materials supplement. In addition, the preschool guide discusses a number of questions that teachers in bilingual programs frequently ask, and Primary 1 has a vocabulary list. Some of the more serious errors in sequencing have been avoided in this carefully worked out bilingual language curriculum.",0
"Education: An Excellent Opportunity to Respect, Maintain and Promote Indigenous Children's Cultural and Linguistic Richness","Education can provide the opportunity to affirm indigenous children’s cultural and linguistic identity by using their funds of knowledge as an essential tool in the teaching and learning process. This paper emphasizes the importance of using indigenous children’s voices, knowledge, and wisdom to continue to develop their talents and capacities to share, learn, inquire, analyze, and create. To do so, indigenous children should be given the opportunity to participate in meaningful activities that allow them to utilize their native language and culture which can be done through bilingual discussions, debates, artistic works, creation of poems, singing of songs, games and group activities related to their own indigenous culture while using both their native and second languages. Also, critical thinking skills can be developed through the use of this type of activities that can be artistic and also promote collaborative work since bringing the community together is fundamental in the indigenous cosmovision. In addition, the techniques that are suggested in this piece can help create a peaceful/harmonious environment in the classroom where students’ affective filters are open to welcome and practice the target language since enriching interactions that embrace diversity in all its dimensions are promoted. Thus, the purpose of this manuscript is to share some ideas to make the teaching and learning process more meaningful, respectful, harmonious, and enjoyable through artistic activities that promote indigenous children’s own language, culture and cosmovision. The ideas that will be discussed in this piece are based on a qualitative research study conducted at a Spanish-Indigenous Tsotsil bilingual school in Chiapas, Mexico.",0
"Imagined Futures and New Technology: Youths’ Language Attitudes in Songea, Tanzania","Building on investment theory, this study analyses the language attitudes of secondary school students in Songea, Tanzania, with a focus on identity and access to digital technology. The study involved 467 secondary school students aged 14–21 years. The data were collected through questionnaires and interviews. Less than half of the students had access to digital technology. Most of them lacked the required linguistic resources. English, a challenge to most students, and, to some extent, even Swahili, are seen as tools for future possibilities and success. Students invest in learning English and want to go abroad. Lack of resources notwithstanding, students’ decisions to invest in learning a particular language is mostly influenced by imagined possibilities. Structural inequalities and socioeconomic differences impact both language skills and the use of digital tools. Consequently, digital resources using mainly English and difficult Swahili terminology become an exclusion mechanism for many Tanzanian secondary school students.",0
Experimenting transmodal storytelling in EFL classrooms to enhance literacy,"This paper focuses on transmodal storytelling and its pedagogical implications for the development of English literacy for non-native speakers. Transmodal storytelling, which utilizes more than one mode of expression to tell a story (drawing on performative arts including dance, music, theatre, mime and puppetry) and takes into account learners' everyday experiences, can be a starting point for developing literacy skills. Testing it in the classroom by telling the students the same story through different modes and different media platforms, using a wide range of meaning-making resources, I explored whether transmodal storytelling can become a didactic instrument in an EFL classroom, in particular with students viewed at risk of falling behind in school, and can improve their language skills and creative capacities. In order to test the effectiveness of transmodal storytelling in the teaching and learning process, I carried out a preliminary empirical study on a group of 14 seven-year-old students in an Italian state primary school between March and May 2018. This research argues that transmodal storytelling could rejuvenate literacy in classrooms, in relation to students with behaviour/integration difficulties and children from disadvantaged backgrounds who receive less support with literacy at home.",0
“The Song of Words”: Teaching Multi-Word Units with Songs,"The need to integrate songs into English Language Teaching (ELT) has been recognized on numerous occasions. Song lyrics host multi-word units which learners can reuse as building blocks in their English, thereby reducing language processing time and effort, and improving their fluency as well as idiomaticity, thus bringing them closer to the native speaker norm. We report on two studies into the effectiveness of using songs for teaching multi-word units to high-school Polish learners of English. The same items were taught to two groups of EFL learners, but only one of the groups heard them in a song. Learners’ vocabulary recall was measured at three points in time relative to the teaching: before, immediately after, and a week after. The group taught with songs showed a significant recall advantage over the other group, especially when tested a week from teaching. The results suggest that songs can be an effective vehicle for teaching English multi-word units.",1
Introduction: Multicultural youth vernaculars in Paris and urban France,"The papers in this Special Issue present some of the results of the Multicultural London English/Multicultural Paris French project, supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) from October 2010 to December 2014 and by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) from 2010–2012. The project compared language variation and change in multilingual areas of London and Paris, focusing on the language of young people of recent immigrant origin as well as that of young people whose families had lived in London or Paris for many generations. Similar projects in other European cities have documented the emergence of new ways of speaking and rapid language change in the dominant ‘host’ language, which are attributed to the direct and indirect effects of language contact; see, for example, Wiese 2009 on young people's language in Berlin, Quist 2008 on youth language in Copenhagen, and Svendsen and Røyneland 2008 on Norwegian). In London, young children from diverse linguistic backgrounds tend to acquire English in their peer groups at nursery school rather than from their parents, many of whom do not speak English or are in the early stages of learning English. Since their peers speak a wide range of different languages, the only language the young children have in common is English; and since many of their friends are also acquiring English, there is no clear target model, a high tolerance of linguistic variation, and plenty of scope for linguistic innovation. By the time they reach adolescence, young people's English has stabilized, and many innovations have become part of a new London dialect, now known as Multicultural London English (Cheshire et al., 2013). New urban dialects and language practices such as these have been termed ‘multiethnolects’: they contain a variable repertoire of innovative phonetic, grammatical, and discourse-pragmatic features. In multiethnic peer groups, where local children from many different linguistic backgrounds grow up together, the innovative features are used by speakers of all ethnicities, including those of local descent such as, in London, young monolingual English speakers from Cockney families. Nevertheless they tend to be more frequent in the speech of bilingual young people of recent immigrant origin, and by young speakers with highly multiethnic friendship groups (see further Quist 2008 for an account of the use of features associated with a multiethnolect in conjunction with nonlinguistic ‘markers’ of style, such as tastes in music and preferred ways of dressing). Our project aimed to determine whether a similar outcome had occurred in multicultural areas of Paris.",0
"English just is not enough!: Neoliberalism, class, and children's study abroad among Korean families","Early study abroad (ESA) has been popular among middle/upper class Korean families who use overseas experiences for the accumulation of capital and class mobility. Following up with two graduate student families in Song (2012), this study examines these two families' post-ESA experiences from the mothers' perspectives. It attends particularly to the role of English in their children's educational trajectories and the family's class positioning against economically-privileged Gangnam families. The results demonstrate the two mothers' complex attitudes toward linguistic and class ideologies that deepen the ‘English divide’ in Korean society. While they criticized class-based inequalities surrounding English education, they themselves were content with the linguistic capital accumulated overseas for their children's competitiveness in the Korean educational context and beyond. They also realized that the increasing number of good English speakers with superior economic means deprived them of the privilege associated with the competence in English. That is, the value of competence is synergistic with other social advantages that are highly dependent on one's economic background. The results illuminate how class mediates not only the distribution, but also the return of the capital through a powerful neoliberal social order that drives Koreans to pursue the valuable capital at any cost.",0
How authentic is language included in English and German language textbooks for primary education in Poland? A case study,"This study aims at investigating the authenticity of vocabulary and grammar structures included in two selected English language textbooks (hereafter ELTs) and two German language textbooks (hereafter GLTs) for the first stage of education in Poland. In order to achieve the assumed objective, the author examined literary materials, that is, songs, rhymes, or short stories, included in selected ELTs and GLTs in accordance with the principles of the corpus stylistics method developed, for example, by Semino & Short (2004), Mahlberg (2014), or McIntyre (2015). With the support of BYU-BNC and DWDS corpora, the performed analysis indicated, for instance, that in the case of both types of textbooks studied, the number of authentic words that children are to learn seems to be rather insufficient. The outcomes of the study enable suggesting certain modifications targeted at the increase of the authenticity of language that the analysed textbooks include.",0
"La canción francófona, una herramienta eficaz en el proceso de enseñanza-aprendizaje de la lengua francesa","This article results from a study that uses French songs in the teaching of French as a foreign language at a high school level. The aim is to improve listening skills and to introduce French culture by using in the classroom a real and motivating tool. In order to achieve this goal, we have used a corpus of French songs in tandem with worksheets specifically adapted to the content and skills that students are expected to acquire during the course. In this research first we determine the student’s level by means of a pre-test. Then, by giving the students a post-test, we detect possible changes or improvements occurred after applying our teaching method. Finally, we compare our students’ results with the results of another group of students not submitted to this method.

Improving English conversation skills through online conversation lessons and classroom interactions with English speakers,"The purpose of this study was to improve the oral English performance of Thai lower-secondary students. The participants in this study were 50 Grade 8 students from Rajaprachanukroh Songkhla Province School in academic year 2014. They were purposively sampled and divided into two groups, one learning through online conversation lessons and the other via classroom interaction with an English speaker. They were individually interviewed to assess their oral English performance before the treatments and after completing the lessons. Students' interviews and conversations practices were video-recorded for close analysis following Conversation Analysis (CA) principles and rated on the following features: fluency, vocabulary, appropriacy, pronunciation, and grammar. The research instruments employed in this study were oral communication tasks for pre- and post-tests. The research findings based on statistical and CA analysis shows that the students' oral English performance considerably improved through the use of online lessons and classroom interaction with an English speaker. The learners engaged in classroom interaction, however, became significantly more fluent and had a wider range of vocabulary than those learning through online conversations, even though their performance in pronunciation were similar. Thus, it is recommended that teachers utilize online lessons not as the sole language learning activity but as a supplement to classroom interaction to strengthen particular speech features.",0

Turkish German,"Today, long-term effects of migration into Germany are shown most notably in the emergence of linguistic practices of young people, many of them second or third generation migrants, in urban areas. Turkish German describes a way of speaking that first emerged in young people's speech in multi-ethnic urban areas and was first associated with Turkish adolescents. Later, it became widely known through its appearance in films, comedies and rap songs. In contrast to earlier studies on immigrants' language in Germany (see section [1]), Turkish German is not associated with imperfect acquisition but with the manner in which speakers actively construct and perform ethnic identities and other social meanings via language. Turkish German is conceptualised either as an ethnolect, or an ethnic style, implying different research traditions with focus on different aspects of linguistic descriptions. Other studies choose the term 'Kiezdeutsch' over Turkish German to emphasise the ways of speaking multiethnolectal dimension. It is the aim of this article to present different linguistic approaches to Turkish German, with a critical discussion of some of the key concepts, and to give an overview over its linguistic features and functions on the basis of relevant empirical studies on the linguistic practices among Turkish-German bilinguals.

The effects of musical training on the decoding skills of German-speaking primary school children,"This paper outlines the results of a long-term study of 159 German-speaking primary school children. The correlations between musical skills (perception and differentiation of rhythmical and tonal/melodic patterns) and decoding skills, and the effects of musical training on word-level reading abilities were investigated. Cognitive skills and socioeconomic factors were controlled as covariates in all analysis. The experimental group received special musical training for 9months. A comparison sample received alternative training (visual arts) for the same amount of time. Another comparison sample did not receive any additional classes during the study period. The results show that rhythmical abilities are correlated significantly positively with decoding skills (both reading accuracy and reading prosody). Tonal skills, however, were not correlated with reading skills. Additionally, the special musical training had a significant effect on reading accuracy in word reading, as analysis of covariance revealed. In this paper, implications for reading development are discussed.",0
Dual language learners in head start: Examining teaching strategies that promote English language development,"There were dual purposes of this exploratory, case study. The first purpose was to investigate and describe the teaching strategies of six Head Start teachers within one program in Oregon whose dual language learners had shown gains of at least three levels in receptive and expressive English language development, as determined by their assessment ratings in Teaching Strategies GOLD Assessment System. The second purpose was to identify what, if any, professional development strategies and resources have been beneficial to those teachers in promoting English language development for children who are dual language learners. This qualitative study utilized three data collection methods: interviews, observations and review of artifacts. The one-on-one interviews with the purposive sample of teachers occurred during the first phase. The interview questions were designed to learn about teaching strategies utilized by Head Start teachers to promote English language development for children who are dual language learners as well as teachers' relevant professional development resources and opportunities. During the second phase of the study, the Classroom Assessment of Supports for Emergent Bilingual Acquisition (CASEBA) instrument was used to conduct classroom observations in each of the six teachers' classrooms. Furthermore, a review of relevant artifacts was conducted during the observations. Seven conclusions emerged from the study. First, home language support in the classrooms contributed to English language development. Second, teachers' use of pictures, gestures and other visual cues promoted children's comprehension of English. Third, culturally responsive curriculum was not necessary for promoting enhanced language outcomes. Fourth, a supportive social/emotional environment in the classroom contributed to progress in expressive language development. Next, singing songs with gestures and high quality teachers' talk in English also contributed to expressive language development. Lastly, professional development, formal and informal, is beneficial and needed for preschool teachers. Five recommendations emerged from the study. Policy recommendations are for college teacher preparation programs to require coursework pertaining to dual language learning and for programs to actively recruit bilingual teachers. Practice recommendations are for programs to implement a Planned Language Approach, set up peer mentoring and training opportunities, and for teachers to plan individual and small group read alouds.

Improving English learning motivation and performance of rural elementary school students in Taiwan,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which providing supplementary English learning resources and instruction within an established motivational framework (i.e. ARCS) could enhance the English performances and learning motivation of rural elementary school students in Taiwan. A mixed methods embedded design was utilized to first explore rural elementary school students' preferences for resources (eg. songs, video cartoons, video games and comic strips) and then design and implement a supplementary curriculum incorporating student preferences following the ARCS model (Keller, 1987) and linking to the themes addressed in regular English instruction. In phase one of the study, fifty-seven fifth grade students from six rural elementary schools chose English songs, English cartoons, English video games and English comic books as their most prefered learning resources. In phase two, during the three months of supplementary instruction in one rural school, levels of twenty-two fifth and sixth grade student's motivated English learning behaviors were observed and recorded. Pre and post student English learning motivation questionaires and English achievement tests were administered to the supplementary instruction students and to a matched group who only received regular class instruction. The supplementary materials and instructional activities were evaluated using ARCS categories and criteria. The supplementary curriculum was judged to be systematically faithful to the ARCS framework and aroused the fifth and sixth grade students' interest from the beginning. Nearly all students looked excited and appeared to be paying attention in class during the first four weeks. As the curriculum continued, the proportion of the students and student time simply attending gradually decreased as the proportion of time and class members actively engaged with learning activities gradually increased. Questionaire scores for motivation to learn English increased in most areas. The intervention group's English proficiency scores significantly improved after receiving the supplementary instruction while the matched regular class scores actually declined.

TEACHING ENGLISH THROUGH MUSIC: A PROPOSAL OF MULTIMODAL LEARNING ACTIVITIES FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN,"The present paper aims to explore the use of music and songs in the teaching of English as a second language to primary school children. By means of musical activities, the authors want to measure the progressive change in students' motivation and their academic results in English language skills. The theoretical framework in which this research is developed corresponds to Gardner's multiple intelligence theory, which can be recently linked to issues on multimodality in learning. Preliminary results show that music enhances linguistic intelligence while multiple ways of learning are practised in the classroom. Adapted from the source document",1
"Low proficiency English learners process pronunciation, reading using color-shape-pattern system: A case study","The unique Color-Shape-Pattern (CSP) system addresses entering and emerging English language learners' (ELLs, ELs) special needs learning pronunciation and reading. This qualitative case study explored how young learners of low English and reading proficiency cognitively and affectively process the CSP system. System components include: (a) Using ovals and rectangles as common denominators to explain English phonics patterns to groups of young, low proficiency ELLs, originated with the researcher; (b) The color component: Adaptations were made of existing systems; (c) Patterns pre-existed in English phonics. Creation of the system was in a public Title1 suburban school with 90% ELLs. Research venues were a private Chinese bilingual school and the homes of three Chinese children with autism, because the researcher's second language is Chinese. Purposeful sampling groups of varying sizes and ages used vowel patterns, chants, repetition, a form of Socratic dialogue, coloring and pasting vowel ovals according to sound, jelly bean reading and instruction; that is, they stated the vowel sound group pattern, sound, and letter then received the matching color jelly bean. All spellings of a sound receive the same color. Participants learned vowel sound patterns inductively, deductively, constructively. Responses were recorded by audio tape recorder and note-taking. The unit of instruction was short vowels, long vowels, and or er ow  oo oi. Data analysis was by constant comparison and phenomenology. Findings: This system facilitates the grasp of pronunciation, reading, spelling for multiple ability levels and ages. Questionnaires, interviews, and member-checking clarified and triangulated researcher observations. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

"A Roadmap for True Accountability: Reconceptualizing Language-learning Services, Reclassification Practices and Monitoring Systems for English Language Learners in U.S. Public Schools","A major problem facing educators in the United States is how to determine when the nation's five million English language learners (ELL) are ready to exit language-learning programs, i.e. to be ""reclassified"" as fluent English proficient (R-FEP) and placed in mainstream classrooms without additional language support. No Child Left Behind mandates ELLs' participation in annual language proficiency and content-area assessments to ensure their constitutional right to a timely exit from language-learning programs and subsequent access to the mainstream curriculum. However, there is little evidence of the validity of current reclassification criteria and practices, and even less is known about the impact of reclassification on subsequent achievement. In this thesis, I conduct a pair of related studies to examine ELLs' tenure in and exit from language-learning programs in U.S. public schools as it relates to academic achievement. In the first study, I estimate the time-to and grade-of reclassification using 8 years of longitudinal data for the 2002-2003 kindergarten ELL cohort in one U.S. state (n=5,354). Using discrete-time survival analysis (Singer & Willett, 2003), I found that the average ELL was reclassified within three years of school entry or by third grade, but the majority experienced later academic difficulties. More than half of reclassified students scored below proficient on content assessments and 22 percent were retained in grade. In the second study, I determined the predictive validity of a statewide language proficiency assessment on standardized tests for a cohort of ELLs who were third graders in 2008-2009 (n=5,498) in the same U.S. state. I found that for advanced-proficient ELLs, there was a strong relationship between students' language proficiency and content performance (English language arts: r=.728; mathematics: r=.651). For students eligible for reclassification, their probability of being reclassified in practice increased by 10 percentage points. However, using an intent-to-treat quasi-experimental design, I found that reclassification did not translate into any improvements in academic achievement for students scoring at the margin of the eligibility threshold. Taken together, my findings suggest a need to re-conceptualize language-learning services and monitoring systems to target the development of ELLs' academic English and content-area achievement in U.S. public schools.

"CULTURAL ELEMENTS IN FRENCH LANGUAGE TEXTBOOKS UN, DEUX, TROIS... NOUS VOILA! FOR LOWER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRADES","While educational system has a crucial role in building a more tolerant and human society, a special place in that process is occupied by early foreign language learning. Since language makes an inseparable part of the socio-cultural context of a country, learners learning a foreign language inevitably make contact with other cultures. By getting to know a new culture and critically looking at their own culture, learners unconsciously develop intercultural competence from an early age which makes the communication with others more successful. Since the French language is underrepresented in the Croatian media (movies and music) and since the teacher, along with the textbook, is the key mediator of culture, selected cultural references and the way they are presented seem very important. This paper examines the approach to the cultural elements in textbooks Un, Deux, Trois...Nous Voila! intended for French students in the lower grades of elementary school.

"""Ah, ah, ah y la letra es a"": Multi-kinesthetic activities and ABC books as a pathway to alphabet knowledge","This research explored the use of a multi-kinesthetic approach combined with guided exploration of alphabet books to promote alphabet knowledge while also enhancing student engagement. Context. The study took place in an all day kindergarten classroom at a Spanish-English dual-immersion public school. The research focused on six Spanish speaking students identified as struggling in letter name and/or letter sound recognition in Spanish. Methods and Data. The intervention was carried out for two weeks, each session lasted fifty minutes. Various alphabet books; pop-up and bilingual picture books were used each day. Multi-kinesthetic activities such as sand letters and chanting were implemented to instruct and interest students in learning the names and sounds of the letters in Spanish. Techniques to sustain student attentiveness and participation included daily checklists, group points and stickers. The data sets included a pre, mid and post assessment on letter name and sound recognition, an informal dictation assessment, an interview-survey, observations, and student writing samples. Results. Results showed that a multi-kinesthetic approach increased students' understanding of the names and sounds of the letters, especially among emergent readers. The intervention made students become more aware of letter shapes, enabling them to produce more letters at a comprehensible level as shown in their writing samples. In most cases, students' assessment results showed twice the growth when comparing their initial and outcome findings. Student engagement in multi-kinesthetic activities and picture ABC sharing was higher when compared to traditional classroom activities.

"'What more is literacy?"" The language of secondary preservice teachers about reading and content","Reform in the fields of adolescent and content area literacy have focused on broadening a definition of literacy beyond the ability to read and write. In a broader definition the language processes of reading, writing, speaking and listening become literacy tools to engage students in the learning of concepts and afford the learner ways to communicate ideas. This qualitative teacher research examined secondary preservice content area teachers' language and thinking about reading, content, and their relationship in the context of a university content area methods course. The nineteen preservice teachers who participated in the study were from the disciplines of math, English, foreign language, social studies, physical education, music and theatre. The study is grounded in constructivist theory; a sociopsycholinguistic model of reading; and content areas as ways of knowing. Data sources included a variety of regular course assignments collected throughout the semester to provide a rich triangulation of the data. I analyzed the data using grounded theory in a process of constant comparative analysis as well as two tools from discourse analysis: cultural models and situated language. Conclusions from the findings of the study in regards to how secondary preservice content area teachers write and talk about reading, content, and their relationship suggested four principles that inform the fields of adolescent and content area literacy: (1) The relationship between reading as a transaction with text and content areas as ways of knowing suggests teaching content area literacy conceptually through a constructivist approach such as inquiry or place-based curriculum. (2) Literacy embedded in a constructivist curriculum engages students in learning content area concepts and has potential to change cultural models such as 'playing the game,"" 'getting through it,"" and subjects 'to cover."" (3) The identities of developing readers and memberships in content area communities of practice are fostered through apprenticeships and authentic experiences. (4) Addressing preservice teachers' theoretical orientations of reading and the secondary schools' tendency to isolate the content areas requires a practicum and/or field-based experiences during methods courses and additional apprenticeships during service teaching.

Is It Just the Telenovelas? Learning Spanish in Israeli Schools,"The article deals with the study of Spanish as a heritage or foreign language in Israel. It reports on research conducted at junior high and high schools, which included a student questionnaire and semi-structured in-depth interviews with teachers. One of the goals of the study was to reveal the motivation for selecting Spanish, a language which over the past decade has become increasingly popular at schools. Another goal was to research the progress students made in the study of the language. The study sought to reveal whether motivations, previous knowledge of the language and personal background of the learners influence their language proficiency. Results show that motivation does not guarantee success in language learning. Moreover, the belief that watching telenovelas (Spanish soap operas) and learning popular songs helps students learn Spanish was found to be incorrect. Significant factors found to be possible predictors of success are previous knowledge, language use, learning years and learners' age. Adapted from the source document",0
Experiential reading: Application of experiential/adventure-based methods to spark interest in reading in high school students,"This study examines the implementation of Adventure Education (AE) in a public high school English curriculum. The scope of this study is twofold: (1) for a school-wide perspective, Plattsburgh High School (PHS) in upstate New York, west of Lake Champlain, was surveyed to determine if and how reading literacy, use of the outdoors, technology (music, television, cell phones, etc.), and life skills were components in the educational experiences of its students; (2) on a more focused level, a case study using a special needs 8:1:1 program (8 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher assistant) was conducted to determine if an AE segment combined with a public high school education English course could identify trends, suggest concepts, and offer rich qualitative data to help improve the interest in reading of adolescent students. The data collected using Experiential Reading (ER), a new to PHS curriculum and specifically designed for his class by the author, indicated that students in PHS welcomed a change in how literacy is addressed and most students were interested in an outdoor component to their learning experience. Moreover, the research demonstrated that during the ER curriculum, students were more attentive, more participatory, and were more inclined to step beyond their comfort zones to experience new learning. The findings of this study are supported in the literature and research in the field of AE, suggesting that the ER curriculum has the potential to assist students with competency in reading in other public high schools.

English for Specific Purposes [ESP] for Students of Early-Childhood Education: Focus on Needs Analysis,"English for specific purposes (ESP) is suggested here as one possible direction in English education programmes for prospective nursery school teachers. ESP refers to the teaching of English as it relates to a particular field of study as needed by a specific group of students. In Japan, several studies on ESP (e.g., Terauchi, 2005; Hashimoto, 2000; Miyama, 2000; Yamazaki, 2000; Yoshida, 2000; Sasajima, 2000) have been conducted. This paper further contributes to the ESP literature by focusing on the specific English language needs of students studying to become nursery teachers. Because the number of foreign children at Japanese nursery schools is increasing, nursery school teachers are more likely to be placed in situations where they have to communicate with foreign children and their parents using English (Osuka, 2006). Therefore, as part of this study, a needs analysis was carried out in order to develop a curriculum introducing ESP into the study of early-childhood education. The participants in this study were 52 freshmen majoring in early-childhood education at a private college. The materials used in this study were four questionnaires on preferred English learning styles, based on Kikuchi (2005), desired English skills at college, based on Havasaka (1995), desired English lessons at college (Carreira, 2008), and desired English lessons concerning children (Carreira, 2008). Also, open-ended questions were asked. This paper explored the following research questions: 1. What are the preferred English learning styles of students in early-childhood education? How many clusters can be found? 2. What are the desired English skills of students preparing for a career in early-childhood education? Among the clusters, how different are these desired English skills? 3. What kinds of English lessons do students in early-childhood education programmes want to get? Among the clusters, how different are the English lessons they want to get? 4. What kinds of English lessons concerning the teaching of children do the students in early-childhood education programmes want to get? Among the clusters, how different are these English lessons which students want? The results revealed that the participants (a) want teachers to use Japanese in English classes, (b) want teachers to correct all their mistakes immediately, (c) want to learn daily conversation in English, (d) want to understand English in movies and television and radio programs and (e) want to get lessons using English movies and English songs for children. The results can be divided into two groups using cluster analysis: one representing negative attitudes towards English learning and the other representing positive attitudes towards English learning. A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare the scores on all the items between the negative attitudes group and the positive attitudes group. The results showed there were significant differences between the two groups. Whereas the negative attitudes group tended to want to learn English using movies and TV programs, the positive attitudes group tended to want to communicate with native English speakers and practice-teach at nursery schools abroad. Therefore, considering students' needs, ESP courses can be introduced in early-childhood education. Suggestions include lessons using movies and TV programs for children and daily English conversation as required subjects, increased communication with native English speakers and practice-teaching at nursery schools abroad as elective subjects. As a future consideration, we should analyze needs for discourse communities and reveal what kinds of English they need in nursery schools after graduation. Adapted from the source document",0
Using music to accelerate language learning: an experimental study,"In recent years there has been considerable public interest in the extra-musical effects of music education, but this has been accompanied by sustained scholarly investigation only to some extent. Research findings have tentatively suggested, however, that a relationship exists between musical learning and language development. This empirical study attempts to explore that relationship by asking whether music, employed as a teaching tool in the modern foreign languages (MFL) classroom, can help to accelerate pupils' language learning. 56 pupils at a large secondary school in the UK were the subjects of the study: these were divided between experimental and control groups. An intervention based on a song was found to be significantly more effective than conventional methods in the short term in helping subjects to memorise vocabulary items. The implications for this finding are discussed, in the context of the current debate about extrinsic justification of the arts. Adapted from the source document",1
The overview of the language acquisition for Chinese city children aged 0-3 years,"This paper examines the language development of Chinese children aged 0-3 years in city families. About baby's language development by the time stages accordingly. Paying special attention to the efforts for the parents or caregivers. Infants receive more talking education and speak earlier. Most parents can hardly wait for their baby to say its first word and communicate with their baby. From about 2 years old, the child should be able to use simple phrases, retell simple story and even to sing song. Parents play an important role in this stage. By the 3 years children begin to use most of function words rather than omit them. And acquisition for the second language will help children's language development. The children have a gift for learning language. Adapted from the source document",0
A New Look at ELCO: Alloglottic Children Speak,"Noting the reluctance, noncommittal attitudes, & slow movement toward multilingualism in the French educational system, the failure of the ELCO (Enseignement des langues et cultures d'origine [Teaching the Languages and Cultures of Origin]) is attributed to the lack of educators' true appreciation of the scholastic situation in which children born in immigrant families not speaking French find themselves when confronting the differences in functions & status of French & their native language. Excerpts from interviews with alloglottic children (N unspecified) conducted for a Ph.D. dissertation on the topic of the place of foreign languages & cultures in French schools (Tran-Minh, 2008) are reproduced to illustrate how this population views the prospect of pursuing education in a native language. The survey shows that alloglottic students are willing to attend native language & culture classes for pragmatic reasons rather than sentimental attachment to their mother tongue. Reform proposals are made for the ELCO program to adapt it to the real needs, interests, & desires of alloglottic students. The new ELCO program should shift content emphasis from nonacademic, folklore subjects to strictly academic ones; the interviewees expressed their desire to learn how to read & write in their native language & receive information about the history & geography of their country of origin instead of being taught native cuisine or music, things they can learn at home.

Webster's Third and the Pronunciation of Hawaiian Loanwords in English: A Different View of Usage,"Webster's Third and the Pronunciation of Hawaiian Loanwords in English: A Different View of Usage T AlbertJ. Schütz University of'Hawai'i at Mänoa he last line in a well-known hapa-haolè song contains what is undoubtedly the longest Hawaiian borrowing in English:2 Where the humuhumunukunukuäpua'a go swimming by.3 Ifyou were a singer, unfamiliar with Hawaiian and learning this song from the sheet music, how could you find out how to pronounce the word? The standard advice is: look it up in a dictionary. And the word does indeed appear in the 2003 electronic version of Merriam-Webster III (MW), with the following pronunciation transcription (followed by the original, divided into measures (stress units), which are explained later): \ihüm3lhüm3inük3lnük31äp3lwälä\4 (humu humu nuku nuku ä pua'a)5 1 As a musical genre, hapa haole refers to a song whose lyrics are on Hawaiian themes, but are mainly in English, usually with a few Hawaiian words or phrases included. 2 Mahalo (thanks) to Carolyn Andrews, who inspired this study by requesting that I write an article on pronouncing Hawaiian words borrowed into English for her website, Carolyn's Corner (Schütz 2006). For their help with editing, mahah to Laurie Durand, George W. Grace, and 'Öiwi ParkerJones. 3 Cogswell, Harrison, and Noble 1933. 4 The MWpronunciation symbols that are cited in this paper are: a hl, â Ici, ä IaJ, au/ au/, e /e/, ê /i/, i hl, ï /ai/, ö loi, ü IvJ. Other conventions used are: italics for orthographic forms, square brackets for phonetic transcriptions, // forward slashes for phonemic transcriptions, and W back slashes for MW transcriptions. 5 This line shows the accent units for this especially long word. Dictionaries:Journal ofthe Dictionary Society ofNorth America 30 (2009), 1-17 Albert J. Schütz Here are the problems with the MW pronunciation. (1) The five unstressed uvowels would never be pronounced as [o] . (2) A primary stress would better reflect /ä/. (3) The \w\ is unnecessary. (4) English does not permit a sequence of identical vowels (\ä(ä\) within a word. (5) The alternating stress levels represent neither the usual Hawaiian or English pronunciation . Turning to a different genre, volcanology, we check the dictionary pronunciations of two well-known terms for types of lava: pähoehoe and 'a'??. MWgives: \po'höe|höe\ and Va1 ä, ,ä'ä\ (pä hoe hoe)('a'ä) The first pronunciation is recognizable, but would be more so if the first syllable were transcribed as Apä/ (with a secondary stress) and the final vowels in the next two syllables as \a\ or \e\. As for the rendering of 'a'ä, the second alternate better represents the final long and stressed vowel of the original, but as in #4 above, this sequence runs counter to English phonological and phonetic patterns. In this article, I discuss how MWhas represented the pronunciation of Hawaiian words borrowed into English. It is not entirely a catalog of errors; many words are handled satisfactorily. But the data do not appear to have been approached systematically. To correct those that have not, I recommend ways in which the transcription can more accurately reflect an authentic Hawaiian pronunciation and still stay within the phonological system of Standard English. And, just as important, I explain why in 2009 — as opposed to 1961, when MWwas published — it is advisable to do so. Introduction Most studies of borrowing concentrate on the direction of the major flow, as it were — that is, words borrowed from the introduced language into the local language. Perhaps one of the reasons is that the figures for the lexical exchange in that direction are so much higher. For example, there are anywhere from 1800 to 3,000 loanwords from English to Hawaiian (ParkerJones forthcoming; p.c., 27/5/08) .6 This is a striking 6 This topic has also been the topic of studies by, e.g., Denzil Carr (1951) and AlbertJ.

Using Music to Support the Literacy Development of Young English Language Learners,"Integrating experiences with music in the early childhood classroom Supports English language learners' literacy development (Peregoy and Boyle, Reading, writing, and learning in ESL. Pearson, Boston, 2008; Saricoban and Metin, Songs,verse and games for teaching grammar. Internet TESL J, 2000). This article describes the benefits of incorporating musical experiences into daily instruction and provides practical activities for classroom implementation, e.g., reading, writing, and singing songs for language skill development, reading fluency, aid writing progress. Despite a teacher's level of aesthetic appreciation and musical training, the value of fostering creativity and enhancing literacy instruction through music is vital in today's diverse early childhood classrooms. Music can transform classrooms into positive learning environments where children thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Providing children with structured and open-ended musical activities, creating an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, and sharing the joy of creativity with each other all are foundational to bases for the growth and development of the early childhood learner.

Dialogue Features as a Characteristic Stylistic and Organizational Element of German Children's Folklore,"German nursery rhymes & other folk poems for children are analyzed, noting that the question-answer dyad constitutes the most salient feature of both their style & composition. Examples are produced illustrating how the two linked utterances -- the query urging a response from the interlocutor, & the reply reacting to it -- are interrelated on communicative, functional, semantic-thematic, structural-syntactic, & contextual levels. This question-answer format facilitates children's acquisition of knowledge about the adult world surrounding them & familiarizes them with the complex rules governing it. References. Z. Dubiel",0
Musical Aptitude and Second Language Pronunciation Skills in School-Aged Children: Neural and Behavioral Evidence,"The main focus of this study was to examine the relationship between musical aptitude and second language pronunciation skills. We investigated whether children with superior performance in foreign language production represent musical sound features more readily in the preattentive level of neural processing compared with children with less-advanced production skills. Sound processing accuracy was examined in elementary school children by means of event-related potential (ERP) recordings and behavioral measures. Children with good linguistic skills had better musical skills as measured by the Seashore musicality test than children with less accurate linguistic skills. The ERP data accompany the results of the behavioral tests: children with good linguistic skills showed more pronounced sound-change evoked activation with the music stimuli than children with less accurate linguistic skills. Taken together, the results imply that musical and linguistic skills could partly be based on shared neural mechanisms. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier B.V.]",0
Intersemiotic Communication in Early Second Language Instruction,"The article refers to the constitutive elements of intersemiotic communication in the didactics of foreign languages. It indicates that you can communicate using not only verbal language, but nonverbal elements as well, for example pictures or music influencing the sense of an utterance. Language & semiotic elements of communication refer to human feelings & are often interconnected. Their constellation simplifies foreign language learning, especially in small children. It is important, therefore, to get to know glottodidactical techniques using music & picture to increase the effectiveness of language acquisition. Adapted from the source document",0
A discourse analysis of the meanings of Hispanic and Latino in United States newspapers and interviews with academics and journalists,"This study compares and contrasts the meanings associated with Hispanic and Latino in articles from the New York Times (NYT), San Antonio Express News (SAE) and La Prensa ( LAP) (bilingual newspaper in San Antonio, TX). Specifically, I analyze the uses, themes and words related to the meanings of these labels in newspaper reports in English and Spanish published in the year 2002. I also analyze the contextual management of the knowledge, opinions, group schema, and discourse structures associated with these meanings in representative texts. I analyze the same components in the coverage of the Spanish/English debate between Primary Gubernatorial Democratic candidates Dan Morales and Tony Sanchez in 2002 and in personal interviews with academics in San Antonio and New York City, and journalists in San Antonio. The interviews help me to better understand the local meanings academics and journalists attach to ethnic terms in their professional lives. The findings indicate the general association of Hispanic with political topics and the particular association of Latino/a with personal subjectivities, the music industry, and the combination of both labels for political and consumer purposes, associations that are regimented by various types of newspaper editorial policies. Opinions on the level of the language ideology of authenticity around Spanish linguistic skills were found as the major topic of concern among journalists, readers and the two democratic candidates in the coverage of the historical Texas Democratic Primary Gubernatorial English/Spanish Debate. The interview analysis indicate that two of the academics and two of the journalists interviewed attach the local the meanings of Hispanic and Latino according to institutional ideologies, previous academic knowledge, newspapers editorial policies, or previous experiences with different Latino groups. This study contributes to our understanding of how the meanings of the Hispanic and Latino label come to be associated with micro-contextual subjective interpretations and macro-social dynamics in the discourse of newspaper texts and that of academics and journalists. Thus, it offers a needed analysis on the importance of the connection of discourse, cognition and society in the contextual management of the local meanings of Hispanic and Latino in public and personal contexts. It also unpacks the taken for granted or common ground social beliefs that are associated with the meanings of these labels in public and personal discourses around the representation of U.S. Latinos.

The development of null vs. overt subject pronoun expression in monolingual Spanish-speaking children: The influence of continuity of reference,"In Spanish, Continuity of Reference is a powerful predictor of the alternation between null and overt subject personal pronouns. Overt pronouns are favored when reference is changed, null pronouns when reference is maintained. To investigate sensitivity to Continuity of Reference, 181 children and 30 adults were tested in Mexico. Participants were told the Spanish equivalent of stories like (1). (1a) Maria and Jose sing songs. (1b) Maria sings a ranchera. (1c) Later, X sings a children's song. The subject of the (1c) sentences was expressed as an overt or null subject pronoun. Two referential contexts were constructed: Maintain Reference: the referent of the relevant grammatical subject is the same as the referent of the previous grammatical subject, e.g., in (1) X refers to Maria. Change Reference: the referent of the relevant grammatical subject is different from the referent of the previous grammatical subject, e.g., in (1) X refers to Jose. Participants' preferences for overt or null pronouns were elicited in both referential contexts. Results showed that adults preferred null pronouns in Maintain Reference contexts and overt pronouns in Change Reference contexts. Only the oldest group of child participants significantly preferred null pronouns in Maintain Reference contexts. This suggests that children tend to include redundant information in discourse, a finding that is corroborated by studies of communication skills (Ford & Olson, 1975; Sonnenschein, 1985; Whitehurst, 1976). With respect to Change Reference contexts, many of the youngest children preferred null pronouns. At around age 9 the preference for overt pronouns in Change Reference contexts became significant. Around age 14 the preference rates matched those of adults. Since our experimental items were created so that null pronouns in Change Reference contexts were ambiguous, such a preference exposes difficulty with establishing clear referents for pronouns. Narratives elicited from participants in Queretaro suggest that the preference patterns are related to the production of ambiguous pronouns. Sensitivity to Change Reference contexts, as well as the production of pronouns with clear referents, requires both awareness of interlocutors' information needs and dexterity with intersentential anaphoric reference.",0
"Traitement auditif, traitement phonologique et acquisition de la morphologie dans la dyslexie developpementale","This dissertation examined the interrelations between reading impairment, phonological processing, acquisition of morphological marks and auditory processing deficit in children aged between 9 and 12 years. A first study conducted with children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI), showed that the error rate produced in adjectival morphological marks for gender, and verbal marks for number, was predicted by the distribution of regular forms (with regular consonant alternation), invariable forms and irregular (opaque) forms in the French lexicon. Children with SLI produced more errors on regular verbs than on regular adjectives. These results strongly support the connectionist approach according to which the extraction of the systematicity underlying the regular forms in French will be more difficult for the verbs than for the adjectives, because in this language, the invariable verbs largely outnumber those pertaining to the two other types. A second study, conducted with reading impaired children showed that these children also experienced difficulties in the acquisition of morphological marks. The results confirmed the importance of the distribution of invariable, regular (with regular consonant alternation) and irregular forms (opaque) in the adjectival and verbal forms in the French lexicon. Results of the first and second study lead us to conclude that a common phonological deficit has a significant contribution for morphological difficulties in children with SLI and reading impaired children. The comparison of the results of the two studies revealed that the acquisition of marks in flexional morphology is mainly based on the exposure to these marks in the oral language. The third study investigated the relation between auditory and reading deficits in children who received a diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). The software TOT (Temporal Order Test) was created for the assessment of abilities in identification of duration and frequency patterns for verbal (the vowel /a/), musical (a trumpet sound) and non-verbal stimuli (tones). The software also displays a visual response mode into which the child selects on the computer screen the picture corresponding to sound sequence he heard. Results indicated that the performance of children, with or without APD, was better for musical than for verbal stimuli. Only a small proportion of children diagnosed with auditory processing disorder and reading impairment obtained scores in the temporal order tests that were lower than aged-matched controls. These results do not support the hypothesis of a causal relationship between a deficit in auditory processing, as assessed through the duration and frequency pattern tests, and a deficit in reading acquisition. The results of the dissertation suggested that a phonological deficit has consequences in the acquisition of morphological marks in both oral and written language, and that this disorder do not stem from a deficit in auditory processing.

Creating a Stimulating Environment for Foreign-Language Communication in Kindergarten,"This paper highlights the importance of early education & the creation of a stimulating environment for the natural acquisition of a foreign language in kindergarten. It stresses in particular the importance of the role of pre-school teachers, peers & adults, as well as the impact of various games, real life activities, stories, songs, rhymes & the media in relation to young children & the provision of conditions for conducting the process of early language learning which would be as natural as possible (and would resemble the acquisition of the mother tongue). A situational approach has been applied, or in other words, a natural process of learning a foreign language in the context of everyday, practical activities. Much before children begin to talk (during the pre-verbal stage), they need to be exposed as far as possible to other people's speech & to acquire communication & interactive experiences in real life situations. An action study was employed using elements of an ethnographic approach since this allowed the direct monitoring, consideration & alteration of the existing conditions for encouraging communication in a foreign language.

"An investigation of relationships among grade level, gender, ethnicity, rhythmic aptitude, and English-language reading skills","A large number of elementary school students appear to excel in music performance skills, especially those related to rhythm, yet the same students may have a difficult time developing English-language reading skills. In particular, it often appears that a portion of minority students perform well in rhythm tasks, yet have a difficult time developing reading skills, with males having more difficulty achieving in reading than females. Researchers have suggested a relationship between language and music skills, in that one can affect the acquisition of skills needed for the other. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships among grade level, gender, ethnicity, rhythmic aptitude and English-language reading skills of first-, second-, and third-grade students. Specifically, the study focused on the predictive strength of grade level, gender, ethnicity and rhythmic aptitude for elementary school students' English-language reading skills. Subjects (N = 200) used for this study included first-, second-, and third-grade students composed of 32% African American, 35% Hispanic, and 33% Caucasian. Subjects were administered the PMMA and the STAR Reading™ tests. Statistical analysis showed a moderate significant relationship ( r = .611, p < .01) between grade level and English-language reading skills and a moderately low significant relationship (r = .437, p < .01) between rhythmic aptitude and English-language reading skills. Multiple regression analysis determined grade level and rhythmic aptitude to be significant predictors (p < .001) of English-language reading skills of first-, second-, and third-grade students.",0
Elementary music teachers instructing Hispanic English language learners: Reflection on practice,"This qualitative study investigated four monolingual, English-only speaking Caucasian elementary music teachers and their reflections regarding instruction of English language learners (ELL). The purpose of this multiple case study was to investigate the teaching practice and curricular decisions of elementary music teachers who instruct Hispanic ELL students. The investigation was conducted during a nine-week period, and data collection included classroom observations, phenomenological interviewing, and teacher audio journals. None of the teachers had prior education or pre-service preparation in teaching music to ELL students. The major theoretical base from which the study was developed was the reflective teaching theory of Donald Schoen (1983). The main research question was: 'What are the participating teachers' reflections about their curricular and pedagogical decisions when teaching ELL students?' Following a description of the elementary music teachers' reflections on practice with ELL students, the study revealed that the majority of elementary music teachers had a lack of preparation and ELL music curriculum, and negative perceptions of the placement program for ESL students. Despite these factors, the teachers made attempts to include ELL students in all music activities. This study showed that while one teacher accommodated specifically for the ELL students' learning, three out of four teachers did not. This study also suggests that music is a subject by which strong interactions between peers, opportunity for language expansion, and other factors occur which have positive correspondence to recommended ELL instructional strategies. A cross-case analysis revealed that the life history and experience of the elementary music teachers had an influence on the teachers' awareness of ELL students. The analysis suggests a relationship between teacher awareness and accommodation. The study also recognized the need for further inquiry regarding ELL students and issues related to their school placement. This study has implications for music education research including suggestions for music teacher preparation in working with ELL students, ELL music resources and curriculum, and pre-service and in-service ELL music preparation.",0
Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD) Training and Strategies That Enable Teachers to Successfully Help Hispanic English Learners Accelerate Language Acquisition and Improve Academic Achievement,"Purpose. The first purpose of this study was to determine which GLAD instructional strategies teachers report are effective in helping their third grade Hispanic English learners accelerate their academic achievement in English language development and reading. The second purpose was to determine which components of the Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD) training helped third grade teachers implement the academic content, skills, and instructional strategies in their classrooms. Methodology. This descriptive study included fifty-two respondents in two school districts. A twenty-four-item survey was used to rate: (1) the effectiveness of GLAD instructional strategies with Hispanic English learners, and (2) identify which GLAD training components helped teachers implement reading content, skills, and instructional strategies in their classrooms. Eighteen respondents were interviewed or participated in focus groups. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative methods were used to analyze interview and focus group data. Findings. All nineteen GLAD strategies were effective to accelerate language acquisition and reading achievement among third grade Hispanic English learners. Six strategies were very effective: Pictorial Input, Chants, Picture File Cards, Process Grid, Cooperative paragraph, and Sentence Patterning. All five GLAD training components were considered important. The five-day training workshop was rated the most important. Training with colleagues and learning to build lessons from state content standards were also rated very important. Conclusions. Teachers who accelerated language acquisition and reading achievement among Hispanic English learners: (1) selected strategies that met the specific learning needs of Hispanic English learners from four categories: Focus and Motivation, Input Strategies, Guided Oral Practice, Reading and Writing, and (2) understood how, why, and when to use reading content, skills, and GLAD strategies effectively to design and implement instruction. Recommendations. Replicate this study with a larger sample of districts and teacher respondents in middle and high schools to see if results are the same as those in this study. Determine if GLAD strategies are effective in helping elementary special education students improve their reading achievement.",0
The Sociolinguistic Situation of Judeo-Spanish in the 20th Century in the United States and Israel,"In the United States as well as in Israel, Judeo-Spanish is rapidly declining as the daily language of communication. The domains for the spoken language have been reduced to use with older people, for humorous & expressive purposes (jokes, stories, songs), as a secret language, & in certain situations such as the work place, where it is used with non-Sephardic Spanish speakers. In other words, Judeo-Spanish is not being transmitted to the young generations as the language of primary socialization. Sociolinguistic/sociological reasons for the loss of conversational use as well as the non-transmission of Judeo-Spanish are discussed in this paper. Characteristic linguistic traits of the present spoken language in both the United States & Israel are also examined. References. Adapted from the source document",0
Are Russian-Medium Schools Ready to Change over to Estonian as a Language of Secondary-Level Instruction in 2007?,"At present, the full programme of general education is available both in Estonian & in Russian. According to the Basic & Upper Secondary Schools Act, however, in upper secondary schools the language of instruction is the Estonian language. Thus the law requires that from 2007 all local foreign-medium secondary schools have to begin a transition to Estonian as a language of instruction. By that time the school system & the national curriculum should guarantee that all graduates of basic school (forms 1-9) have the Estonian competence enabling them to continue their education in Estonian. The stipulated change of the language of tuition is necessary to improve the Estonian competence of the pupils of Russian-medium schools, thus fostering their integration in the Estonian community. Of all pupils of Estonia 23% attend Russian-medium schools. Most of them (ca 80%) live in Tallinn or Eastern-Virumaa. The number of children directly affected by the school reform of 2007, i.e. the total number of pupils in Russian-medium grade schools today is 32510. According to the national curriculum, Russian-medium schools teach all subjects in Russian, while Estonian is taught as an obligatory first foreign language from the first form on. Such a segregative programme, however, does not enable a satisfactory Estonian competence. The national curriculum overlooks the fact that the necessary competence level cannot be attained without bilingual training in grade school. Thus, to improve the results of Estonian teaching a new, bilingually-oriented alternative approach called language immersion was adopted in 2000, drawing on Canadian & Finnish experience. About 4% of the pupils of Russian grade schools are involved. For them, at least half of the teaching takes place in Estonian. In their parents' opinion this is the best choice available. Unfortunately this does not concern the 2007 reform, as by that time around a mere hundred or so of ""immersed"" pupils will have finished grade school. A number of schools have, on their own initative, included one or more Estonian-medium subjects in their curricula. The choice, however, has been occasional, without considering linguistic efficiency. Evidently for the sake of simplicity, the most frequently chosen subjects are music, handicrafts, gymnastics, & drawing. The teachers of Russian schools believe that a uniform level of Estonian competence could be achieved only in case unambiguous & equally obligatory programmes were enforced for all schools. The conclusion of the article reads that most of the Russian-medium schools are not sufficiently prepared for the 2007 reform. The main reason lies in the fact that the stipulated transition has not been shaped by state organs. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document",0
Successful Teachers of Spanish Who Commit to the Teaching of Cultures: Two Qualitative Case Studies,"The purpose of this qualitative case study was to investigate how two successful teachers of secondary Spanish, who are committed to teaching about culture, actually taught culture. In this study, ""culture"" was described from a postmodern perspective that seeks to understand contemporary global events and how these events affect Spanish speakers. Culture-general goals for overcoming ethnocentrism and being able to make cross-cultural comparisons were at the core of this view. The traditional notions of formal culture (literature, music, and art) and everyday culture (customs, values, and beliefs) were subsumed under this description. Data were collected for each participant over six months. The data sources included observation notes, interview transcripts, the researcher's journal, and document analysis of vocabulary lists, quizzes, rubrics for culture-related presentations, adaptations of short stories, and culture-information handouts. Data were analyzed by Banks' (2003) four levels of integration of multicultural content, as adapted for the foreign language classroom: the contributions, additive, transformation, and social action approaches. These approaches also aided with investigating the teachers' use of local, state, and national standards; their resources and materials for teaching cultures; their pedagogies of cultural and linguistic content; and their perceptions of the cultural content their students were learning. A major finding of the study was that the participants taught primarily through the transformative and additive approaches with respect to culture-specific topics such as Hispanic holidays and culture-general topics such as stereotyping. Although they were not familiar with national, state, or local guidelines, their teaching aligned closely with district goals. Another finding was that the participants primarily used literature and movies to teach about culture. Also of note was the finding that the linguistic and cultural pedagogies of the participants differed, in that the first participant planned her lessons around culture learning, while the second planned for grammar learning. Both participants perceived their students to prefer learning culture-general rather than culture-specific material in their Spanish classes. Neither participant assessed cultural knowledge beyond objective facts. The findings suggest that there is a need to focus on three important areas during pre-service training: coursework to develop nuanced understandings of Hispanic cultures; study or live abroad requirements; and, incorporation of Banks' modified approaches as a framework for examining and implementing cultural content and pedagogy. The findings further suggest a need to emphasize two important domains during teacher in-service work: familiarity with and the use of the national standards as a guide for creating curricula and integrating multicultural content into lessons, as well as for the development and synthesis of alternative resources for teaching culture. The findings also suggest additional areas for future research: development of more sophisticated lessons using transformative and social action approaches; exploration of alternative and authentic means of assessment of cultural knowledge; and native versus nonnative Spanish-speaking teachers' comfort with and knowledge of Hispanic cultures.",0
Literacy Practices among Quechua-Speakers: The Case Study of a Rural Community in the Peruvian Andes,"The purpose of this research was to understand the literacy practices among Quechua-speaking members of a rural community in the Southern Peruvian Andes. Research findings respond to the need to question and propose answers to educational issues in the context of the efforts of Bilingual Intercultural Education in Peru. The ethnographic approach to literacy practices focused on different domains: the households, the church, the school, and the community. Data were gathered by conducting individual interviews, life history interviews, participant-observations, and videotapes of literacy events in diverse contexts. Findings suggest literacy practices in this Quechua-speaking community were shaped by institutional literacy practices of the school, the state and the Protestant church. The hegemony of the Spanish language and literacy over the oral and written Quechua was noticeable. Literacy practices in the school were imposed on children and lacked meaning in their lives. Literacy instruction was decontextualized, composed of unchallenging activities, and was shaped by teachers' ethnocentric views about the children, their parents, their culture, and language. Teachers assumed the role of civilizing the children and negated the linguistic and cultural resources the students brought to the classroom. Literacy practices occurred within the normalizing everyday practices at school, in which Quechua literacy was used only as a bridge towards Spanish literacy. Bureaucratic Spanish literacy was imposed in the community. However, it was performed in a particular way. It was practiced as a collective activity and was surrounded by Quechua orality. Orality gave meaning to the texts and constructed the literacy events within activities of interpretation and negotiation. There were few uses of vernacular literacies, which show the particular interests of the writers. Quechua literacy was only used in the context of the Protestant churches in the community. Religious literacy practices were characterized by the memorizing of Bible passages and the copying of religious songs. In conclusion, literacy was imposed by social institutions, however, they were reinterpreted to satisfy the goals of the members of the community and were performed in a particular local way.",0
Linguistic Representations of Niger's Leaders of Opinion,"Interviews with prefects, subprefects, adjuncts, & ministers of the Republic of Niger (N = more than 60 males) & traditional elders, nobles, & other leaders in the Zarma-speaking region of Niger (N unspecified) were structured to elicit Ss' views on the languages used in Niger: French, the official language; Arabic, the language of religion; Hausa & Songhay-Zarma, the majority languages; & three minority languages, Kanuri, Fulfulde, & Tamajaq. Ss were asked whether some languages were better than others in general & for specific functions & were asked to comment on the use of French as the official language, official status for other languages, & the use of other languages in writing. Results indicate that French is viewed as a major factor in national cohesion; Ss fear the effects of elevating a national language to official status, although most Ss favor educating children in their native languages. Even among traditional leaders, French is frequently categorized as a national language & a vehicular language; political, economic, & international advantages of French are stressed. 1 Appendix, 3 References.

A Comparative Study of Reading Comprehension Skills among Children Who Speak an English Lexicon-Based Creole and Other Speakers of English,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of speaking an English lexicon-based Creole on the reading comprehension achievement of children of Caribbean heritage. The participants consisted of 37 boys and 38 girls completing the third and fourth grades. Thirty-six who were of Afro-Caribbean heritage spoke an English Creole at home, and 39 who were of Afro-American heritage spoke American English. The measures used were Card 1 of the Thematic Apperception Test (Morgan & Murray, 1985) to gain a sample of spoken language, the Reading Comprehension subtest of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test Fourth Edition (MacGinitie, MacGinitie, Maria, & Dreyer, 2000), the Listening Comprehension subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (1990), a test of naming speed (Lemoine, Levy, & Hutchinson, 1993), the Rapid Automatic Naming Test (Semel & Wiig, 1980), the Test of Phonemic Awareness (Yopp-Singer, 1988) and a measure of mothers' educational expectations. The study found that Caribbean Creole-speaking children were having significantly more difficulty with reading comprehension than their non-Creole counterparts in the third and fourth grades (p (less than) .05). However, the significance of language group as a predictor in reading comprehension was marginal (p = .06). Phonemic awareness was found to add significantly to the variance in reading comprehension (r2 = .33, p (less than) .05). These results suggest that teachers place emphasis on phonemic awareness training in the early grades for these children as one way of countering the marginal effects of the Creole on reading comprehension. They also highlight the role of parental expectations on reading comprehension achievement.",0
Teaching English to Young Learners through Songs,"Teaching English to Young Learners has become a trend nowadays. In every school, English is taught as one of the main subjects. In teaching young learners is not like teaching adults, children have their own way of learning. Since children like to play and have fun, the learning and teaching process should be suited with the nature of the children themselves. One of the forms of fun activities for children is through music, and songs are the common form of music that children know. Through this paper, the writer wants to show that through songs, children could enhance their language skills, such as speaking, listening and writing. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",0
"Neuropsychological Test Scores, Academic Performance, and Developmental Disorders in Spanish-Speaking Children","This study was designed to (1) analyze the effects of age & sex on different neuropsychological test scores of a randomly selected sample of Spanish-speaking children, (2) analyze the value of neuropsychological test scores for predicting school performance, & (3) describe the neuropsychological profile of Spanish-speaking children with learning disabilities (LD). Two hundred ninety (141 boys, 149 girls) children, ages 6-11, were selected from a school in Bogota, Colombia. Three age groups were distinguished: 6-7-, 8-9-, & 10-11-year-olds. Performance was measured utilizing the following neuropsychological tests: Seashore Rhythm Test, Finger Tapping Test (FTT), Grooved Pegboard Test, Children's Category Test (CCT), California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), & Bateria Woodcock Psicoeducativa en Espanol (Woodcock, 1982). Normative scores were calculated. Age effect was significant for most of the test scores. A significant sex effect was observed for three test scores. Intercorrelations were performed between neuropsychological test scores & academic areas (science, mathematics, Spanish, social studies, & music). In a post hoc analysis, children presenting very low scores on the reading, writing, & arithmetic achievement scales of the Woodcock battery were identified, & their neuropsychological test scores were compared with a matched normal group. Finally, a comparison was made between Colombian & American norms. 7 Tables, 1 Appendix, 50 References. Adapted from the source document",0
Nicknames as Evidence of Verbal Playfulness,"Evidence of language play within nicknaming is provided, based on questionnaire data drawn from English- & Afrikaans-speaking informants (N = 333). The analysis focused on the nicknames of two groups differing in age: young children (approximately aged 5) attending school for the first time & those leaving school (aged 17-18). The nicknames reveal experimenting with patterns of sounds (eg., alliteration, assonance, rhyme, & rhythm) & meaning (eg, puns, anomaly, & contrast), all of which are strong features of early nursery rhymes, & which are universal in most cultures. Strong conformities to the sound patterns commonly found in early child-directed speech are also found & suggest a vestigial trace of some sound symbolism underlying language. Parallels between nicknames & slang are pointed out &, in contrasting the nicknames of younger children with those of older adolescents, certain important differences emerge which reflect the effect of linguistic, social, & cognitive maturity on the language games people play. 1 Table, 29 References.

The Irrealis Conditional in Didactic and Authentic Texts. A Didactic Proposal on the Example of Patricia Kaas: Une derniere semaine a New York,"It is demonstrated that authentic texts are better suited than textbooks to teach grammar in French as second language. This is illustrated with the didactic potential of the lyrics of Patricia Kaas's song Une derniere semaine a New York (The Last Week in New York) for teaching German high school students irrealis conditional clauses introduced by si 'if'. The treatment of irrealis conditionals in traditional textbooks is examined, & the methodology proposed there is found rather uninteresting & unstimulating. The authentic text's advantage in motivating the learning process by providing real language use contexts for grammatical concepts is stressed. The lyrics are included, & methodology & educational activities are suggested. 14 References. Z. Dubiel",0
How Not to Give Up Motivation,"Proposals are made to Croatian English as a second language high school teachers for stimulating students' learning motivation by effectively utilizing the material in Doolan-Hindlaugh-Spaleta's textbook In Frame 1: udzbenik engleskog jezika za 1. razred gimnazije ([In Frame 1: An English Language Textbook for the First Gymnasial Grade] 1998). Vocabulary & phraseology suitable for discussions about students' parents & questions a teacher may ask to stimulate it are suggested. Song lyrics are recommended as interesting material for enhancing students' learning experience, & presentation methodology & activities are suggested. 4 References. Z. Dubiel",0
The Media Portfolio. Independent Work with Media in the Second Phase,"The media portfolio, an example of the new task-based foreign-language instruction methods used in secondary education in The Netherlands, is presented. Although the media portfolio, created relatively independently over the course of months from the widest possible variety of source material, does not receive a grade, adequate completion (judged by the teacher) is a prerequisite for final exams. It is argued that all skills can be developed & used in the creation of a media portfolio; suggestions for planning & execution of tasks are provided, as are ideas for evaluation & assessment. The method is illustrated with an example of an English media-portfolio task based on pop songs. It is concluded that the media portfolio represents a very modern way of learning, in which students are individually responsible for their skill acquisition & the difference between learning inside & outside the school walls is minimized, turning language learning into a personal & real-life experience. 1 Appendix.

Category Norms for Verbal Items in Nine Categories for Younger and Older Preschoolers,"Based on the study by M. Hasselhorn, A. Jaspers, & M.-D Hernando (1990), which provides typicality norms for children in kindergarten & in grades 1, 2, 3, & 4, category-production norms for preschoolers are presented. For the first time in German-speaking areas, a group of young children (aged 3:6-4:6) was investigated. Seventy children aged 3:6-4:6 & 75 children aged 5:6-6:6 were asked to generate examples of nine different categories (bathroom articles, farm animals, clothing, kitchen articles, furniture, musical instruments, toys, modes of transport, zoo animals) within a time period of one minute per category. Relative naming frequencies, ""objective"" & ""subjective"" extents, & coefficients of discordancy are provided for each category & age group. The results show age-related differences concerning both the categories' extent & structure. The results suggest that German developmental researchers should use age-specific category norms to control or vary category knowledge. 2 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 11 References.

Towards a More Effective English Pronunciation Instruction,"The need for pronunciation instruction in English as a second language programs is addressed in light of research findings. It is advanced that the phonological system of a second language is acquired gradually; therefore, pronunciation instruction should be integrated into the aural/oral activities of a communicative program, with native-like pronunciation as a long-range goal. The importance of teaching the suprasegmental aspects of pronunciation such as rhythm & intonation is stressed. Pedagogical activities for teaching rhythm are suggested, including poetry, children's rhymes, limericks, jazz chants, exercises with rhythmic patterns, & guided oral practice. 1 Figure, 66 References.

Researching and Promoting Phonological Awareness in the Nursery Class,"Initial phases are reported of an ongoing longitudinal study intended to prevent the emergence of written language difficulties by identifying & treating poor phonological awareness in children prior to school entry & literacy instruction. In the first phase, Ss (N = 240 native British English speakers, average age 4:5) participated in activities designed to provide experience in attending to the sound structure of language, after which they were assessed for nursery rhyme knowledge, rhyme detection, & alliteration detection; 41 Ss were identified as having poor rhyme awareness & were targeted for one-to-one training. In the second phase, 21 Ss were given training in skills supporting phonological awareness & the remainder were assigned to a control group for equivalent training in categorization skills. Literacy skills assessments of all Ss are planned at age 7. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 24 References. Adapted from the source document",0
Linguistic Pluralism for Internationalization: The Case for Non-Traditional Approaches to Language Study for U.S. Schools,"Because foreign languages (FLs) & FL education are not supported in contemporary US society, it is argued more effort ought to be made to teach young children about other languages initially, & only later to teach them the actual languages. Five approaches to such study are discussed: (1) a ""linguistics for kids"" approach composed of a general course on the history of human languages; (2) a welcoming approach that exposes young children to basic vocabulary & songs in various European languages; (3) a modified welcoming approach extended to include more exotic languages, eg, Japanese, Chinese, & Hindi; (4) a sign language approach that teaches children sign language as a way of exposing them to messages about the diversity of communication; & (5) a universalist approach that teaches one relatively easy-to-learn language as a base for later FL study. The merits & drawbacks of each program are discussed. 27 References. D. M. Smith",0
A Test for Assessing Phonemic Awareness in Young Children,"The Yopp-Singer test of phonemic segmentation is presented as a means of assessing young students' phonemic awareness in order to identify early those students who may require additional phonemic activities. Allowing feedback after each response, a 22-item individually administered test measures the ability to separately articulate the sounds of a spoken word in order. Reliability was determined through a comparison to nine other tests of phonemic awareness administered to second-semester kindergarten students (N = 100). Validity was determined through a factor analysis on reading achievement of the same students from kindergarten through grade six. Spelling achievement from grades two-six was also calculated. Questions of use with adult emerging readers & students with limited English proficiency are noted. 3 Tables, 32 References. M. Gordon",0
Effects of Learning Modalities on Melodic and Rhythmic Retention and on Vocal Pitch-Matching by Preschool Children,"The effect of a 10-week study employing visual, auditory, &/or kinesthetic learning modalities on retention of musical melody, rhythm, & pitch attainment was investigated for preschool Ss (N = 61) of Hispanic-, Anglo-, Asian-, & African-American ethnicities considered economically or linguistically disadvantaged, ie, they were learners of English as a second language. Pre- & posttest comparisons of the Ss' performances were analyzed for musical skill acquired & instruction modality used. The auditory or multimodal instructional methods were correlated with greater increases in performance for the melodic & rhythmic subtests. Based on the results, teachers are encouraged to vary learning modalities. 2 Tables, 7 References. L. Borgen",0
Comprehensible Input via Culture-Schema: Preparation and Inspiration for Literary Study,"Difficulties in the transition from entry-level second-language courses to introductory literature classes in the target language, as reported by students, include lack of cultural context & confusion over the creative potential of the target language. Exposure to well-known Spanish-language culture schemata - children's literature, folklore, poetry, songs, & historical, legendary, & literary figures & events - is facilitated by exercises enabling recognition of references in literature reading. Students practice creative manipulation of the language in story-writing & -telling projects, developing different versions based on story skeletons derived from original texts, which students subsequently read. Acquisition of a Spanish cultural repertory in this manner also enhances classroom communication in Spanish. 7 References. J. Hitchcock",0
Can Japanese Children Learn English?,"A discussion of the problem of teaching English to Japanese children using approaches & materials developed in Europe & America for teaching native speakers, English as a second language learners, & children using the Roman alphabet in their own language. Little progress is made in reading & writing with the whole-word approach & a mechanical, unnatural use of the phonic approach. The answer is minimizing the number of sounds to learn & maximizing the time to play with these sounds. Games & songs that are carefully designed to suit the children's language needs are the most effective means of learning spoken English. J. Mayberry",0
Teaching French as a Second Language to Six-Year-Old Children Using a Teaching-Methodological Set,"Early French as a second language instruction in Soviet elementary schools is discussed, presenting teaching materials for first graders in the form of a teaching-methodological set (Uchebno-metodicheskiy komplekt) compiled by A. S. Kuligina & M. G. Kir'yanova (in press). The set contains a teacher's book, a cassette with songs & poems, & a picture book. The set is based on principles of early language teaching: (1) an integrational methodology uniting educational, developmental, socio-pedagogical, & didactic tasks; (2) communicative orientation, (3) the use of the native language in a supportive role, & (4) collective interaction during the learning process. Game-based teaching of phonetics, vocabulary, grammar, listening comprehension, & dialogical & monological speech is discussed. Z. Dubiel",0
Four-Beat Meter in Popular Verse and Its Potential in the Study of Speech Rhythms,"Past attempts to analyze English versification using classical Greek prosodic methods, musical notation, the principle of isochrony, & modern metrical phonology are all reviewed & found inadequate. The most promising approach to meter seems to be the theory of beat rhythm (Attridge, Derek, The Rhythms of English Poetry, London: Longman, 1982) which succeeds in representing both phonetic & metrical features in scansion. According to the theory, meter consists of a regular alternation of beats & offbeats, determined not only by the inherent stress qualities of syllables, but also by syntagmatic perceptual factors leading hearers to expect a regular structure. Using beat theory to scan a variety of English verse, it is demonstrated that examples ranging from nursery rhyme to Old English poetry exhibit a common structure consisting of four beats per line. Extension of analysis to children's rhymes from several other languages supports the claim that this four-beat rhythm is a universal feature of popular verse. A discussion of the ways in which the actual speech rhythms of different languages manifest themselves within the basic four-beat structure leads to the conclusion that investigation of cross-linguistic differences in the realization of this universal pattern can yield valuable information about language-specific speech rhythms. 61 References.

Learning Language through Content: Learning Content through Language,"Content-based foreign-language objectives - a new way of designing foreign-language curricula - is examined in terms of its applications in foreign language in the elementary school (FLES) programs. The rationale for developing foreign-language skills through the content areas, eg, mathematics, science, art, physical education, & music, is that it recreates natural language-learning situations that are cognitively demanding. Instructions for identifying points of coincidence & defining language objectives in the curriculum are provided. It is recommended that the decision-making process be shared between FLES instructors, other educators, & administrators. 4 Figures, 28 References. M. Perdoux",0
Intelligibility of Reggae Lyrics in North America: Dread Ina Babylon,"An examination of the extent & nature of the intelligibility of Jamaican reggae song lyrics for native speakers of North American Standard English, Black American English, Jamaican English Creole, & other West Indian English creoles. Songs were chosen because reggae music is an important cultural, social, & political form of artistic expression in Jamaica, & has an important role in other countries. In determining the extent to which the ""message"" of the songs could be understood, two tests were administered to four groups of speakers (N = 10 Jamaican secondary school students in Toronto, 6 other West Indian students, 9 black American US college undergraduates, & 19 white North Americans in Canada & the US). A cultural background test (open-ended definition/identification) gave an index of ""prior cultural knowledge."" In the second test, Ss listened to three songs in Jamaican English & English Creole, gave a general interpretation, & transcribed specific verses. Scores for prior knowledge were highest for Jamaicans, followed by other West Indians, white North Americans, & Black English speakers. Prior knowledge did not significantly account for variation on transcription scores, indicating that cultural & linguistic competence were related but still separable. This was considered a significant finding because ""Jamaican"" is generally perceived as somewhat similar to Standard English & as intelligible by outsiders, a view not supported here. A descriptive analysis of the transcriptions demonstrated specific ways in which ""linguistic short-circuiting"" occurred, eg, as English speakers depended on pre-existing general content schemata (frameworks) to ""make sense"" out of partially comprehended language. Some problems in comprehension of specific pronunciation & grammatical patterns were also noted. 4 Tables, 31 References. Modified AA",0

Do Immersion Programmes Adversely Affect Pupil's English?,"Four immersion program models, ie, two variants of the language arts model & total & partial immersion, are briefly outlined & evaluated. The partial immersion program developed by Bayswater South in Feb 1981 is described & assessed. First & third graders (N = 35 & 32) were taught art, science, & physical education & some aspects of music & social sciences in German. The Daniels & Diack Reading Test, Silent Reading Test, Australian Council for Educational Research Lower Grades Test & Primary Reading Survey, & Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were administered to measure Ss' English language skills as compared to those of Eng-only students. Results are tabulated for class, grade, & program duration. It is found that the program had no significant negative effect on the development of Eng-lang skills in reading, vocabulary, & spelling. Ss' listening skills were actually superior to those of Eng-only students. 7 Tables, 17 References. Z. Dubiel",0
"Age, Individual Differences in Musical and Verbal Aptitude, and Pronunciation Achievement by Elementary School Children Learning a Foreign Language","In experiment 1, the age factor in new speech sound acquisition was investigated. M & F Ru elementary schoolers (N = 18) in grades 2, 4, & 6 were taught foreign conss (Spanish, German, & French). Results showed that the novel speech sounds' correct pronunciation was correlated with age. In experiment 2, the variables of age, psycholinguistic ability, & musical talent in new sound acquisition were studied. Children (N = 18) aged 5 to 12 participated in a 10-week Mandarin Chinese course. The Wing Standardised Test of Musical Talent & the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities were administered in posttesting. Age was positively correlated with performance in both production & repetition. The other two variables produced a low r. 1 Table. Z. Dubiel",0
Sievers and Scops: A Revaluation of Old English Poetic Techniques,"Reviewed are the opposing views of two schools: E. Sievers (Altgermanische Metrik [Old Germanic Metrics], Halle, 1893) vs J. Pope (The Rhythm of Beowulf, 2nd ed, New Haven, 1966); & two ""movements"": J.-M. Luecke (Measuring Old English Rhythm: An Application of the Principles of Gregorian Chant Rhythm to the Meter of Beowulf, Wisconsin, 1978) vs M. Halle & S. Keyser (English Stress, Its Form, Its Growth, and Its Role in Verse, New York, 1971). It is hypothesized that the Old English poetic ""half lines"" result from the formalization of the spoken lang. On the basis of an analysis of the Ohthere passage in Alfredian Orosius, it is tentatively concluded that: (A) little manipulation is required to divide Old English prose passages into ""half lines,"" (B) Old English poetry (at the ""metrical"" level) resulted from formalizing the spoken language into smaller units with a limited number of primary stresses, & (C) Sievers's types are descriptive but not prescriptive. 18 References.

Suggestopedic Foreign-Language Instruction in Our Schools?,"Summarized are research findings on suggestopedia from Bulgaria (by the founder G. Lozanov), the USSR, US, & Canada. The major features of suggestopedia for foreign-lang (FL) instruction are presented: (1) suggestive, learning-promoting teacher-student interaction, (2) absence of fear & tension situations & boredom, predominance of joy & teacher encouragement, & (3) conscious & unconscious information absorption. Described is the course of a suggestopedic FL class: rhythm, intonation, role play, & classical music during the teacher's second presentation phase are the elements that create a learning-promoting atmosphere & increase students' memorization capability. Research findings cited show that the students learned much more vocabulary & material than did control groups in the same amount of time, although a recent study in Canada found some weaknesses in grammar mastery. It is deemed feasible to make teacher conduct similar to that in suggestopedia, organize intensive courses of elementary instruction with 20 students maximum, & offer students bilingual material in addition to memorization phases with music.

The Unified Language Project,"Reported is the two-year Unified Language Project (ULP), an experiment conducted in four primary schools to study ways of improving the teaching of English as a second lang. A song or game was first taught in Malay (the mother tongue) & then in Eng. End-of-year assessments included listening, speaking, & reading tests. The Pilot Experimental group was significantly better than the Control group in both Malay & English in the overall results. At the end of the second year the significant difference remained only for Eng. The Follow-Up experimental group was superior to the control group in both Malay & English in the overall results. The ULP appeared generally superior in developing listening comprehension, speaking ability, & vocabulary, but less successful in teaching reading. Modified AA",1
French Songs and Poetry: A Basis for Studying the Language and Civilization,"The use of poems, children's rhymes, & songs in teaching French at the primary & secondary level is discussed. These devices allow students to use linguistic structures automatically while understanding the meaning of what they are saying. In addition, many songs can be used as pattern drill, wherein students invent lines which follow the original pattern. Rhymes used while jumping rope are also used. Many simple poems, such as J. Prevert's ""Dejeuner du matin"" (Morning Breakfast) can provide valuable grammatical lessons (in this case, a review of the passe compose). Many traditional songs do not interest the contemporary student; even the popular singers may not excite students' interest. It is suggested that the kinds of songs recorded by Nana Mouskouri may appeal to older students. B. Annesser",0
Let's Dance the Capuchin,"This volume is an attractive program developed by a Canadian teacher for learning French as a second language in early childhood classes. Pleasurable learning activities designed to advance the youngster's skills & personality & establish an attitude favorable to language learning are emphasized. The Teacher's Guide is the program's core, presenting the philosophy, organization, & content of the materials, games & other activities (including mathematics & art), as well as structural & topical inventories. Stories, songs, & dramatizations with limited vocabulary are used; frequently used structures are focused on. The children's booklets are grouped in three levels & come in either a picture or a story edition. The booklet aids comprehension, recall, & the creation of a new dialogue based on the story. The story edition may be used for reading the material assimilated audio-lingually. The Teacher's Guide supplies the instructor with countless games to reinforce vocabulary learning & structure. While some of the material is obviously Canadian centered, its appeal is broad. Modified AA",0
Song in Second-Language Teaching: The Uses of Imagery,"Songs can be effectively used in teaching 2nd languages; the use of simple French folksongs in elementary French classes is described. Song is defined & its similarity to speech pointed out. Songs can mediate between the child & the environment in much the way language does. Songs rich in rhyme, as well as poems & chants, can allow children to approach language naturally & easily. Drawings & drawing can also be used in conjunction with songs. Pictures can be used to illustrate the meaning of songs. ""Rhythmic drawing,"" in which abstract designs are drawn to the beat of a song, can be used in developing listening skills & encouraging personal expression. Songs can be most effectively taught antiphonally, that is, by the teacher speaking or singing 1st & the students gradually repeating more & more of the song. Songs can be used in games & dramatic activities, including response games & miming. Songs develop linguistic abilities through lexical & structural substitution, addition, & reformulation. Songs can be an integral component of 2nd language programs. D. Burkenroad",0
Speech Instruction in the English Classroom: The Need for Oracy,"Speech instruction is given short shrift in most English classrooms, partly because few English teachers have had formal training in speech instruction. Greater attention must be paid to speech instruction in teacher training programs. When speech is taught in high schools, it must be broadened to include & encourage all sorts of verbal activities. Informal speech activities, eg, conversation, telephoning, giving directions, & introducing people, should comprise a regular part of the Eng curriculum. Formal speech instruction, eg, platform speaking, debating, & choral reading, should in most cases be reserved for elective courses. To introduce a speech unit into the regular English class, teachers should review group dynamics & chart some class discussions. These should be recorded & played back for analysis. For most students, ""oracy"" is as important as literacy, if not more so; secondary school students who have not achieved literacy must be helped to achieve oracy so that they will not be handicapped in the most common communication skills.

Forming Future Teachers of French,"The issues of certification, the process by which young college graduates are licensed to teach, & the actual training of would-be teachers of French are discussed. Accreditation has been handled by State Certification Boards, the Instit of Higher Learning, & the ""Program Approval"" system. The use of the Modern Language Association Proficiency Tests as part of the certification program is an objective means to measure ability & to provide an opportunity to realign programs with the specific needs of the profession. More promising, however, are the trends involving more time spent with youngsters in the elementary &/or secondary schools. The following recommendations are given concerning training for the teaching of foreign language: (1) Learning language is a never-ending process, & teachers should not be embarrassed by their limitations; (2) Less emphasis should be placed on the exactness & refinement of pronunciation; (3) There should be more language courses above the normal 2-year sequence; (4) More culture & civilization vs. literature courses should be offered; (5) Literature should be understood in its broadest meaning taking popular culture into account; & (6) Prospective teachers should be required to spend 1 year in the country whose language they teach. Since nothing can replace direct contact with the actual teaching situation, it is recommended that teachers get 1st-hand experience as early as possible in their teaching career. This would permit more effective screening of would-be teachers. Further, future teachers should be required to experiment with information learned in methods classes. Singing & game-playing should be included in training, & instruction should be given as to the value of professional organizations. Finally, foreign language teachers should be given the weapons to ""defend"" their subject matter effectively in dealings with Boards, Administrators, Counselors, parents, & their own pupils. L.

Experimental French Programs in the Carleton Roman Catholic Separate School Board,"In response to the need for bilingualism in the National Capital Area of Canada, an experimental program in French was instituted by the Carleton Roman Catholic Separate School Board in 1970. 3 programs were expanded: (1) intensive French for grades 1, 2, & 3; (2) immersion French for kindergarten & grades 1, 2, & 3; & (3) enriched French in grades 4 through 8. These involve teaching school subjects in French for various lengths of time, & gradually building from speaking to writing. A new program, Franco-bus immersion, was also established. 7 specialists in music, physical education, & arts & crafts, as well as in language arts, visit schools periodically in a specially equipped bus.

Le francais a Calgary: Making a program relevant,"In response to an urgent need, new materials have been developed for French classes in Calgary junior high schools. ""Le francais a Calgary"" is a series of filmstrips and tapes prepared as a supplement to the course Voix et images de France (Montreal: Didier). The 19 filmstrips are accompanied by taped dialogues, songs, cartoons, poems, proverbs, jokes, written vocabulary reviews, and a grammatical analysis for the teacher. The main goal of the project is to adapt the French course material to students' lives in Calgary. Calgary culture and adolescent life the northern Canadian students. The project material is intended as a resource with maximum flexibility for the teacher. Results of the project in Calgary already seem to be well worth the time, money, and effort. R. Gaskill",0
Recreation in the English course,"How to convince French high school students to continue studying English when they openly admit that they've had it ""up to here"" after seven to nine years of ineffective language learning is discussed. Articles from magazines such as Newsweek, Esquire, and Playboy interest maybe one out of three; the Watergate Affair is uninteresting to most, as are such topics as pollution, movies, urban problems, and international personalities. But, offered something to do with pop singer Cat Stevens, their enthusiasm swells. Perhaps never before has text analysis of poetry been so unanimously received. The words of such songs are current, tender, and address themselves to the conflicts which are peculiar to adolescents. Pop songs offer a wide vocabulary, and phrases can be built on for use in the language lab. Students eventually can compose their own songs. To accustom them to technical and scientific writing, they can write descriptions of simple vehicles using only the verbs ""to have"" and ""to be"". Finally, the students write their own amusing renditions of well-known stories such as ""Little Red Riding Hood."" Examples are included of these three types of original composition. R. Laskey",0
"Grammar and Growth: A ""French Connection""","A teacher's experiences with high school French classes are recounted. Learning occurred when creativity & personal choices were allowed, & when there was controversy. When modular scheduling was arranged, more time was given to listening & speaking; again, issues of interest to students generated learning. Even so, something in the structure of the class was still missing. Individualized approaches were successfully used with several students. A class of ""free learners"" was set up; individual & group projects were undertaken (among them were 15 essays on French literature & music, a composite story based on 12 French stories, poetical vocabularies, etc.). Evaluations pointed out that mistranslations occurred, that some students wanted a more rigid system & others wanted more oral work; however, most students were happy about learning French. It was demonstrated that curricula can be selected by students, that there can be self-evaluation, & that flexibility & cooperation can be encouraged. Controversial topics proved to be most conducive to learning. D. Burkenroad",0
Experimental teaching of foreign languages beginning in the first year in the schools of Belgrade,"A description of a foreign language experiment prefaced by a brief summary of the educational system in Yugoslavia, an enumeration of goals previously set by the administration, and a list of reasons why these goals were not adequately achieved. Preparation for the reorganization of the language program entailed: determining the goals, extensively preparing the project, establishing a program (i.e., how much time should be devoted to what subject), having workbooks written by language specialists, deciding which schools would participate in the experiment, and choosing a staff of teachers. The experiment embodies the following innovations: (1) Oral expression must precede written expression; (2) By teaching other courses (such as physical education, drawing, etc.) in the foreign language, the children are not overworked as would be the case if the additionally required hours of language instruction were assigned to the language class only; (3) The teacher's manual should contain lessons relating to pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary, and linguistic structures, academic and family life, animals, city and country life, physical exercises, games and songs, and drawing lessons which give students the opportunity to illustrate the aforementioned subjects; and (4) Vocabulary scheduled for the first year should consist of up to 500 words and expressions. The first oral evaluation (a series of 10 questions) yielded 60% correct and complete answers, 15% correct, partial answers, 7% partially correct answers, and 8% incorrect answers. Transition from oral to written expression does not begin until the third year, and the vocabulary does not differ much from that acquired during the oral phase. R. Laskey",0
Children's literature and ESL,"Success in teaching Japanese university graduates English through the use of Mother Goose nursery rhymes is reported. The Harrison method, employing simple children's materials, was employed in off-campus programs. A current program is reported involving the vocabulary, syntax, rhetoric, culture, and meaning of adult and children's materials. Students are encouraged to pick enjoyable reading which is one or two levels below their normal reading level and to make educated guesses about vocabulary meaning rather than use a dictionary. The program objective is rapid silent reading, not translation. The teacher's task is to help students find interesting materials appropriate to their reading ability and to encourage them to read it. R. Gaskill",0
A FLES Latin lesson--Philadelphia style,"Highlights are presented of the content and teaching methods used in the elementary school (FLES) Latin program in the school district of Philadelphia. A ""typical"" 20 min segment of instruction is described in which a Latin dialogue is taught audiolingually and work is done relating ancient to modern culture. Songs, games, and multisensory media are utilized by the teacher. Reference is made to the teaching of English derivatives and cognates related to the Latin dialogue, and to the uniquely efficient way that Latin provides for extending the English vocabulary of inner-city children. The FLES Latin program described serves over 10,000 children in 115 elementary schools of the school district of Philadelphia. AA",0
Uses for English,"Whatever the reason for studying one's own language at school, it is not to learn informal speech. Although principles of formal speech could & probably should be taught, the problems of written language are greater. In writing--as opposed to speaking--the pace of thought is different, syntax is different, & different brain centers are perhaps involved, so if writing is to be learned it must be taught. If schools do not teach ""grammar"" as part of writing, students must contrive to learn it on their own. The responsibility for teaching the comparable skills of preparing & interpreting other non-verbal skills (such as gestures or commercials) should be assigned to communications departments. Besides moral education, the other adventitious or suppositious use of English--through concentration on literature--is aesthetic education. Literary arts should receive the same space in the curriculum as do other arts such as painting & music, no more, no less. In structuring & ordering these studies, the question of whether teaching is continuous & cumulative or discontinuous & changing in character from stage to stage must be asked. If English studies are to be discontinuous, 3 phases might be considered. The 1st, compulsory, phase should cover utilitarian grammar & rhetoric & basic cultural heritage. The 2nd phase has 3 practical subdivisions: (1) the refinements of grammar & rhetoric; (2) an introduction to literature; & (3) an in-depth treatment of some particular subject matter. At the 3rd, specialist, level 1 does whatever scholars do. Elementary school teachers should have technical training in grammar & rhetoric as teachable subjects. Those whose intellectual affinities are with language at large should study literary language. L. Freer",0
Advances in English spelling,"An attempt to apply scientific concepts to the area of spelling, oral and written, through the substitution of encoding for rote memorization. The background of spelling and its relation to language in general (and English in particular) are discussed. The traditional procedure of memorizing words singly as semantic units is no longer considered adequate to meet modern demands, as size of vocabulary and need for accurate writing increase. Through shifting to the discovery and application of basic principles of sound-letter correspondences, at first one letter only for each sound, later adding a rational basis for correct choices between alternative ""probabilities"" and the utilization of ""rules"" when dependence on sound alone is inadequate, a procedure is established which makes it possible to deal with words in large groups instead of having to memorize them singly. Advanced application of this approach enables an individual to spell correctly about 90% of English words leaving only 10% to be memorized individually by specially devised steps. When once the principles of the Childs Spelling System are mastered, they can be applied indefinitely as vocabulary increases, and (with necessary modifications) to foreign languages. Over the 25 years since its original invention, this system has achieved significant improvement in spelling where competently used. It has turned spelling into a meaningful, reliable activity, and has had an indirect effect in improving reading. Through the incorporation of sound linguistic principles and the ""discovery technique,"" an outmoded, inefficient educational procedure has been revolutionized into an effective modern tool. AA",0
German sketches on videotape in the language lab,"Many universities have closed circuit T. V. systems or learning labs with T. V. screens. Members of the language department of the University of South Florida have produced 10 lessons for the beginning year of college German. Most of the dialogue on the tapes is spoken by native speakers. The vocabulary is elementary, but there is ""action"" or a punch line in every sketch. The topographical backgrounds and introductory music are taken from the cultural tradition of Germany. In class, the T.

The playful element in foreign-language-instruction,"Teaching foreign languages in high school has always been a serious business. The introduction of playful elements into the instruction helps students learn more easily. Several ways to enliven classes are: (1) using simple books instead of classic literature such as non-fiction, science fiction, humor, and detective stories; and (2) using dialogues in the classroom, preferably with invited native speakers. Playing games can be a very rewarding way to learn grammar, as is the use of popular songs. Introducing these and other techniques would widen the scope of foreign language instruction and enliven classes for the students.",0
Teaching multilingual literacy in Ugandan classrooms: The promise of the African Storybook,"For over a decade, the authors have worked collaboratively to better understand and address the challenges and possibilities of promoting multilingual literacy in Uganda, a country of over 44 million people where over 40 African languages are spoken and English is the official language. This article focuses on the diverse ways that teachers promote early literacy in large multilingual classrooms, and how the innovative African Storybook digital initiative might support primary school teachers in both rural and urban areas. We begin the article with a description of our collaborative work on the African Storybook (http://www.africanstorybook.org/) and one of its derivatives, Storybooks Uganda (https://global-asp.github.io/storybooks-uganda/). Then, drawing on a collaborative study of primary school classrooms in eastern Uganda, we analyze four common strategies that Ugandan teachers use to promote multilingual literacy in their classrooms: the use of the mother tongue as a resource; songs and multimodality; translanguaging; and linguistic strategies for classroom management. We follow this with a discussion of a 2015 teacher education workshop in eastern Uganda, which illustrates how the African Storybook can help support Ugandan teachers as they navigate the challenges of large classrooms. We conclude that the African Storybook has much promise for addressing the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.",0
Multilingual education in early years in Luxembourg: a paradigm shift?,"There is a call for multilingual pedagogies including the use of literacy in several languages in early childhood education. However, many practitioners find it difficult to challenge the dominant language ideologies and are unsure of how to develop literacy practices in multiple languages. This paper is based in Luxembourg where a multilingual programme has been implemented in early childhood education in 2017. The research project examines the language used in daily communication and literacy activities of educators and parents in day-care centres, as reported by educators in two online-questionnaires. The findings show that the educators and parents use multiple languages when communicating, singing and reading with children in the centres. In addition to French and Luxembourgish which dominate, they use five other languages. Their reported multilingual practice reflects their beliefs that speaking and reading in several languages promotes language learning. However, while the programme is multilingual, a range of home languages are marginalised. The educators produce a language hierarchy in the centres in which the parents reproduce. While collaboration with parents can be effective in bringing home languages into day-care centres, educators need to be aware of language hierarchies and ideologies.",0
Using Literature to Improve Writing Skills at B1 Level. A case study in Italy,"In the second language classroom, literature has been employed through different methodological approaches. Some of them view literature as a means for deepening language knowledge, while others regard it as a resource to raise multicultural awareness and critical thinking. The purpose of this article is to show that it is possible to enhance students’ writing skills by using literary excerpts as language models. Moreover, in a holistic approach, literature can develop students’ motivation by offering them emotions, reflections, and social contexts they can relate to for meaningful learning experiences. This is demonstrated through the results of a case study conducted with Italian high school students. The novelty of this research is a course syllabus designed for the purpose of using literary excerpts of several genres including articles and songs as a source of language to teach English.",0

The Awareness of Phonemes among Malaysian Beginning Readers,"The reading process needs a number of skills including phonemic awareness. This paper investigates phonemic awareness in a group of kindergarteners. One of the expectations of the Ministry of Education in Malaysia is that students are able to learn separate letters of the alphabet and their sounds. This vision relies heavily on developing students' phonemic awareness. However, most young learners who enter kindergarten lack the skill of phonemic awareness. Thus, this study explored EFL Malaysian beginning readers' level of phonemic awareness. The sample in this study consisted of 40 kindergartners aged 6 on average. The Yopp-Singer Test (Yopp, 1995) was administered in the beginning of May, 2016. Descriptive statistics indicated emerging awareness.

"Manulex-MorphO, une base de données sur l’orthographe du français intégrant les morpho-phonogrammes","La consistance des correspondances graphème-phonème (CGPh) et phonème-graphème (CPhG) facilite l’apprentissage de la lecture-écriture dans une écriture alphabétique. Il faut donc avoir des statistiques sur ces relations dans le lexique écrit adressé à l’enfant. Jusqu’à présent, ces analyses statistiques ont été réalisées indépendamment de l’analyse morphologique.

Having analysed the most important works summarising or related to youth discourse, three major trends of youth discourse research can be distinguished. Traditional approach can be ascribed to the first trend, when the elements used in youth discourse are evaluated from the point of view of the norm. According to sociolinguists, youth discourse is perceived as a way of speaking, through which the youth express their belonging to a particular group. The third trend addresses the connection of the research on youth discourse to culture studies that embrace the diversity of youth subcultures in Western culture.The usage of the elements of foreign languages is often mentioned when defining youth discourse. Therefore, the object of this research is new loanwords in Lithuanian that were not recorded in Lithuanian dictionaries published before 1990 or noted in Lithuanian youth discourse. New loanwords were collected from different printed and electronic resources containing texts written for or about the youth in 2014–2016. The research data includes 310titles of new loanwords, and examples of text excerpts illustrating the research object taken from more than 100 different articles written for or about the youth and representing printed and informational electronic space. The articles were collected from the New Loanwords database in 2014–2016. The aim of the research is to analyse the origins, semantic groups, main reasons for using and functions of new loanwords in Lithuanian youth discourse. Qualitative analysis of the new loanwords in Lithuanian youth discourse was conducted. When selecting texts ascribed to youth discourse, primary attention was allotted to the age of the addressor and the addressee. The texts created by the youth (school or university students aged 12–25 having no professional experience) and for the youth are ascribed to youth discourse.In the analysed discourse, new loanwords most often perform referential, expressive,social and metalinguistic functions. Referential function is most often performed by the new loanwords that fill in the gaps in the vocabulary or refer to the concepts new to Lithuanian youth. Communication with the addressees of own age, as well as communication with the addressees of other nations is characteristic of the youth addressor. Therefore, a lot of new loanwords are taken from English music styles, the media and computer technologies that in essence determine the fact that youth culture is created in the digital space, and learning is based on experience. The expressive function is performed by new loanwords that are employed with the aim to tell something more expressively, to strengthen the feeling, to flaunt, to rhyme,to create allusions, etc. The style of such texts is frequently ironic, whereas the inclusion of the English word emphasises or highlights irony. The social function is accomplished by the new loanwords that aim at distinguishing oneself from other social groups. New loanwords are used to express the identity of a social group, belonging to a particular age group, or to express a rebellious identity. New loanwords enter the youth discourse by the metalinguistic1) meaning-explanatory or 2) value-based commentaries. It is noteworthy that the new loanwords containing a metalinguistic commentary are not abundant in youth discourse – the new loanwords are most often included without introductory metalinguistic commentaries.Differently from other discourses, the subjective meaning of a new loanword is provided by an explanatory metalinguistic commentary in the youth discourse. Meanwhile, a value-based metalinguistic commentary is meant to indicate the reason, usually stylistic one, of the choice ofa new loanword, which is evaluated by the significance of the aestheticism of the new loanword.",0
Rapping in Catalan in class and the empowerment of the learner,"Despite the well-known educational possibilities afforded by Rhythm And Poetry (RAP) for the development of musical, lyrical and critical skills [Morrell, E., & Duncan-Andrade, J.

This paper focuses on a four-day series of rap workshops given in 2012 by a famous local Catalan rap artist in a multicultural and multilingual state school in Catalonia. It analyses the impact that the workshops had, above all in terms of classroom engagement, linguistic empowerment and textual 'agency' [Moje, E. B., & Lewis, C. (2007).

J.: Lawrence Erlbaum], on a range of students with varying degrees of command of the Catalan language and with different degrees of experience with rap music. Through the classroom activity described herein, we show the pedagogical opportunities that rap music offers as a hybrid text in-between oral and written codes that makes it a powerful vehicle for self-expression, whilst enabling the acknowledgement of real uses of languages and genres related to the cultural practices of urban students, in the classroom. In particular, we argue that bridging Catalan rap culture to the goals of the school curriculum, especially in highly multilingual and multicultural school contexts, helps to promote the socialisation of the Catalan language in and beyond the school.",0
Arabic-speaking U.S. college students' comprehension of English emotional tone: A psychological anthropological approach,"Emotional tone in Western languages (i.e., the Germanic and Romance group) is influenced by the Western musical scale. Studies have shown that as differences increase between Western and non-Western languages, overall comprehension of emotional gesture and emotional tone decreases (the “linguistic proximity” hypothesis), though ratios between percentages of perception correctness for different emotions is fairly universal (the “in-group advantage hypothesis”), revealing cross-cultural mechanisms that obscure or reveal certain emotions to outsiders. Training in Western music helps Western children and non-Western youth and adults to better recognize Western emotional tone. Social Anxiety and Major Depression have been correlated with reduced emotional tone comprehension, and music therapy is known to relieve these disorders’ symptomology. For Westerners and non-Westerners alike, musical exposure and training may help not only emotional tone proficiency but also mental well-being.     Studying Arabic speakers’ comprehension of Western emotional tone was novel as an exhaustive search uncovered only two studies on emotional tone recognition by Arabic language speakers (using Web of Science and Academic Search Premiere). Also,here are strict sanctions in Islam on the relation of musical tones to emotion or kinesthetic action like dance (via the “tawhid” tenet), limiting conservative adherents’ Western media exposure and possibly affecting their vocal tone expression as well. My convenience-sampled study subjects were in gender-balanced groups: 12 Arabic international college students and 19 American college student controls. Research methods included (1) an English emotional tone discrimination test using recordings of one actor’s and one actress’ vocalizations of six emotionally different statements, accompanied by semi-structured and recorded debriefing interviews, (2) participant observation, and (3) quantitative survey instruments to measure cultural affinity (ARSAA II survey), musical genre affinity and performance experience, and mental health (DASS 42 survey). I performed descriptive statistical analysis on the quantitative data, and then theme analysis on the qualitative data to reveal both culturally shared and also personal reasons for response choices.    The “linguistic proximity” hypotheses was validated for Arabic speakers, as Arabic students scored 50% lower than American students in accuracy on the emotional tone recognition tests, with Arabic females scoring lower than Arabic males. Statistically significant correlates to low emotion recognition scores include, in rank order, those of higher Arabic than American cultural affinity, those of higher Arabic compared to American musical affinity, English language experience, and anxiety level (the latter mostly with Saudi females). High affinity for Arabic culture may lead to integration issues relative to the American educational system and religious mandates forbidding developing certain kinds of interpersonal relationships; however, these associations may also simply reflectthe amount of time spent in America. Quantitative and qualitative data reveal various culturally relative and Arabic-only gender differences in perceptions of English-language encoded emotions. Some Arabic students preferred non-translatable emotional terms, and others said that speed and volume of speech might be more important than intonation for Arabic emotion expression and understanding.    Nine out of the 12 (75%) of my Arabic subjects were Saudi Arabian and thus conservative Muslims with little exposure to Western tonalities (let alone “emotional” Arabic music). If their government were made aware of the importance of musical tonality in English language, Islamic “tawhid” strictures on musical expression and exposure might be lifted for students abroad. As it was, many Saudi students I met averred that they enjoyed one or more Western musical genres, which meant they would likely be receptive to such reforms. English language coursework could involve theater and dance attendance, where facial and gestural expressions generally matched dramatized vocal and musical elements. Better English language and emotion comprehension would facilitate better communication and well-being and thus augment students’ abilities to become ambassadors for the Arabic world and to find professional opportunities abroad.",0
Narrative and Multimodality in English Language Arts Curricula: A Tale of Two Nations,"The author focus on print and multimodal narrative, observing congruities and divergences between the role of narrative in English language arts curriculum policies in the elementary years in the US and Australia. Multimodality is defined here as the semiotic meanings that can be made from the interrelationship of two or more modes. Modes are sign systems that describe socially and culturally shaped semiotic resources for making meaning, be they writing, drawing, music, or drama. Narrative plays a pivotal role in the socialization of learners to the literacy practices sanctioned in mainstream education throughout the Western world. Narrative texts are an essential part of language policy in the twenty-first century, and will continue to be ubiquitous in a growing variety of media and modes, given increased affordances for combining words with other modes in digital sites of display. In this tale of two national English curricula, there is a shared valuing of the narrative genre, but with differing degrees of emphasis on multimodality and grammatical features, including image-text relations.

Prelinguistic Infants Are Sensitive to Space-Pitch Associations Found Across Cultures,"People often talk about musical pitch using spatial metaphors. In English, for instance, pitches can be 'high' or 'low' (i.e., height-pitch association), whereas in other languages, pitches are described as 'thin' or 'thick' (i.e., thickness-pitch association). According to results from psychophysical studies, metaphors in language can shape people's nonlinguistic space-pitch representations. But does language establish mappings between space and pitch in the first place, or does it only modify preexisting associations? To find out, we tested 4-month-old Dutch infants' sensitivity to height-pitch and thickness-pitch mappings using a preferential-looking paradigm. The infants looked significantly longer at cross-modally congruent stimuli for both space-pitch mappings, which indicates that infants are sensitive to these associations before language acquisition. The early presence of space-pitch mappings means that these associations do not originate from language. Instead, language builds on preexisting mappings, changing them gradually via competitive associative learning. Space-pitch mappings that are language-specific in adults develop from mappings that may be universal in infants. Adapted from the source document",0
Processing of Lexical Stress at the Phonological Level in French Monolingual and Bilinguals at 10 Months,"Nowadays, more than half of the world's population is bilingual (Grosjean, 2010). Consequently, a new area of research has developed over the past decades to determine how infants growing up in bilingual families, hearing two languages simultaneously from birth, detect and learn the regularities of each of their two languages without confusing them. As one of their first step in language acquisition, infants have to learn the basic speech sound categories of their native language. In this area, they have to learn the phoneme inventory of their native languages, and the phonological rules according to which these phonemes arc combined. But they also have to learn properties related to the prosody (or music of speech) of their native languages, such as lexical stress or tone. These properties are part of the representations of words, and they also constitute cues used for example to recognize the sound pattern of words in the speech stream, a necessary step in learning the words of their native languages. The present study will explore how bilingual infants, learning two languages with different prosodic properties at the lexical level (French, and another language with lexical stress), process lexical stress at the phonological level compared to French-learning monolingual infants.

"Social networking, workplace, and entertainment literacies: The out-of-school literate lives of newcomer Latina/o adolescents.","Studies indicate that Latina/o immigrant youth engage in a wide range of sophisticated literacy practices outside of school that are often transnational, crossing various linguistic, cultural, and social spaces. Technology has further afforded immigrant youth the opportunity to develop transnational capabilities which are rare in the mainstream population, yet needed in the 21st century of global connectedness. However, Latino immigrant youth drop out of school at disproportional rates, suggesting that their literacy practices are not recognized or valued by the educational system. Using a New Literacy Studies perspective that recognizes multiple literacies that are meaningful within their sociocultural traditions, this collective case study investigated the range, form, and purpose of the out-of-school literacies of four Latina/o adolescent English Learners who are new arrivals. The qualitative methodology employed constructivist interviews, digital and actual artifacts, and observations. Findings demonstrated that the most prevalent out-of-school literacies the participants practice take place on the social networking site of Facebook, in their workplaces, and through the entertainment media sources of music and television. A cross-case analysis suggests that the literacy practices in these spaces have unique and purposeful roles for the individuals that allow them to connect to their home countries and maintain their Latina/o identities. Additionally, the participants use their out-of-school literacy practices to acquire English, support themselves, and establish a place to succeed. The five aforementioned spaces that their Facebook, workplace, and entertainment literacy practices fill are virtually absent from their in-school literacies. This study suggests literacy pedagogy and research must not continue to impose a narrow monolingual, monocultural, monoliterate, and monomodal view of Latina/o immigrant students which essentially divests them of their greatest resources. Their literacy practices demonstrate that they are transnational, transcultural, emergent bilinguals who competently engage in multimodal means of communication across multiple linguistic, cultural, social, and geographic borders. Educators must reconceptualize school-based literacy to account for the ways immigrant youth make meaning outside of school to provide them a more equitable education that will nurture their transnational skills needed in modern society.

Verbal inflection errors in child L1: Syntax or phonology?,"Song, Sundara & Demuth (2009) find an asymmetrical pattern for verbal inflection errors in child English: They observe more errors in sentence medial position than in sentence final position. To account for this asymmetry, they point towards the surface differences of both sentence positions. A similar asymmetry in Dutch, in which embedded clauses cause fewer problems for verbal inflection than main clauses, has been related to V2 (van Kampen 1997; Bastiaanse & van Zonneveld 1998; Weerman, Duinmeijer & Orgassa 2011). The present study disentangles both explanations (sentence position, i.e. 'phonology' vs. V2, i.e. 'syntax'), and aims to provide a unified account for both the patterns found in English and Dutch. The inclusion of PP-over-V constructions in a sentence repetition task with monolingual Dutch children (aged 4;0 to 6;2) enables us to show that the phonological account proposed for English can account for the Dutch pattern as well.

Home literacy practices of Arabic-English bilingual families: Case study of one Libyan American preschooler and one Syrian American preschooler,"Individual differences in early literacy skills can be attributed to children's previous history of emergent literacy experiences during their preschool years. The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn about the emergent literacy experiences of one Libyan American preschooler and one Syrian American preschooler and how their families support these experiences in their bilingual homes. Through the lens of social theory of learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) and sociocultural theory (Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978), this multi-case study was designed to explore family literacy practices with a preschooler in a naturalistic setting. The questions guiding this study were: (1) How did the texts, tools, and technologies available in two bilingual home settings impact the emergent literacy practices of a Libyan American child and a Syrian American child? (2) What support did family members provide for these two children as they developed emergent literacy practices in their bilingual home settings? Data sources included a demographic questionnaire, digital-recordings of family literacy practices with a preschooler, audio-recorded in-depth interviews with the parents, home visits, the preschoolers' writing samples, and photographs of literacy activities, materials, and the home environment. The recorded family literacy practices and interviews were transcribed and analyzed to identify emerging themes. Both within-case analysis and cross-case analysis were conducted. Findings revealed that the preschoolers in both families use a multimodal process such as talking, drawing, singing, chanting, recitation, technologies, and sociodramatic play in their daily literacy experiences. The parents are not concerned with teaching their children specific literacy skills; but they naturally use techniques for keeping them on task and questioning skills to enhance oral language and comprehension development. These families' home literacy practices are Americanized by living in the mainstream social group, and English is frequently used among the family members. However, their bilingualism and religious literacy practices enrich and vary their children's emergent literacy experiences and their family literacy practices. The significance of this study resides in the importance of getting to know individual families' backgrounds to better understand and respect the cultural practices of family literacy.

The acquisition of wh-questions and auxiliary movement by Korean-English bilingual children,"In this dissertation, I will propose the Person Feature Auxiliary Movement (PFAM) Hypothesis, which states that the combination of certain features in the head of C yield certain Spell Out results. More specifically, the PFAM Hypothesis states that when [Q] and a valued [TNS] feature are present in C, the resulting Spell Out is a phonologically null element ^h, while the combination of [Q], valued [TNS], and a person specification result in the Spell Out of do. The PFAM proposes this analysis in order to account for the pattern of T-to-C movement that is found in the development of wh-questions by Korean-English bilingual children. In order to further investigate these patterns, a longitudinal study and elicitation experiment were conducted, the latter specifically targeting the effect of [PRS] in auxiliary movement. The data from the two studies revealed four stages of acquisition for do and be, where auxiliary inversion is acquired person-by-person in the following order: second, first, and third person. The PFAM Hypothesis explains this data such that when T contains a person specification, the feature forms a complex matrix with [TNS]. When the uninterpretable [uTNS] targets [ TNS] for movement, the complex matrix that contains [PRS] must also be pied-piped to maintain integrity of the matrix. Thus, the features [Q], valued [TNS], and [PRS] are present in C and are Spelled Out as do. If a phonological element, such as be is moved to C, that element gets Spelled Out in C position. However, if no [PRS] feature is present in T, the [TNS] feature can be singly targeted by [u TNS] in C. Thus, the combination of features [Q] and [TNS ] Spell Out as a phonologically null element in C, or ^h. The PFAM Hypothesis accounts for the acquisition data found in this study and its predictions are borne out in the findings.

Productivity and Reuse in Language,"A much-celebrated aspect of language is the way in which it allows us to make ""infinite use of finite means"" (von Humboldt, 1836). This property is made possible because language is fundamentally a productive computational system: Novel expressions can be composed from a large inventory of stored, reusable parts. For any given language, however, there are many more potential ways of forming novel expressions than can actually be used in practice. For example, English contains suffixes that are highly productive (e.g., -ness ; Lady-Gagaesqueness, pine-scentedness), but also contains suffixes which can only be reused in specific, existing words (e.g., -th; truth, width, warmth). How are such differences in productivity and reusability represented? How can the child acquire this system of knowledge? This thesis presents a formal model of productivity and reuse which treats the problem as a structure-by-structure inference in a Bayesian framework. The model -- Fragment Grammars, a generalization of Adaptor Grammars (Johnson et al., 2007a) -- is built around two proposals. The first is that anything that can be computed can be stored. The specific computational mechanism by which this is accomplished, stochastic memoization, is inherited from Adaptor Grammars (Goodman et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2007a). The second proposal is that any stored item can include subparts which must be computed productively. This is made possible by the computational mechanism of stochastically lazy evaluation, introduced in the thesis. Throughout the thesis, Fragment Grammars are systematically compared to four other probabilistic models of productivity and reuse which formalize historical proposals from the linguistics and psycholinguistics literatures. The five models are evaluated on two very different sub-systems of English morphology: the English past tense, which is characterized by a sharp dichotomy in productivity between regular (i.e., +ed) and irregular (e.g., sing/sang) forms, and English derivational morphology, which is characterized by a graded cline from very productive (e.g., -ness) to very unproductive (e.g., -th). The thesis examines many aspects of these two domains including: performance on past-tense inflection, past-tense processing phenomena, developmental overregularization, the productivity of derivational suffixes, ordering restrictions on derivational suffixes, and base-driven selectional restrictions on suffix combinations.

'Only the Immigrants Can Speak the Queen's English These Days' but All Kids Have a Jamaican Accent: Overcompensation vs. Urban Slang in Multiethnic London,"This paper explores the urban slang spoken in multiethnic London, drawing on the primarily Jamaican Creole language spoken in Zadie Smith's novel White Teeth (2000) as a case study, as well as a variety of ""grime"" or hip-hop lyrics broadcast on a London-based satellite TV network 2004-2006. Rather than a serious study, the author attempts merely to show how popular literature & music have contributed to language change in London over recent decades & to demonstrate the problems related to an increasingly global perspective on English. The findings indicate that the ""winning model of speech"" reflected by both the musical lyrics & literary speech is a kind of community English or ""multiracial vernacular"" (R. Hewitt 1986). As a secondary object, the results are compared with results of recent linguistic research. S. Stanton",0
"Definition of the concept of the noun, using grammar centered on the verb or Gramatica Viva","When studying Spanish grammars of different character, structural, functionalist or generativist, it can be noticed that the concept of parts of the sentence or grammatical categories, and particularly the concept of noun, still follows the traditional paradigm centered in the noun- subject defined by Nebrija, Bello and Cuervo and the Real Academia since 1771. Using a grammar centered in the verb, verbal grammar or Gramatica Viva, and using a corpus of 50 popular Hispanic songs, expression of language in action, chosen for their grammatical and semantic richness, we intent to demonstrate that noun and other grammatical categories can be defined in a more productive manner. Our objective is to propose a paradigm which, taking the verb as the essential category, allows to differentiate morpho-syntactically between: a) Substantive, adjective and adverb as primary categories, that is, nouns; b) Adjective as a secondary category qualifying and quantifying substantive nouns; c) Adverb as a secondary category quantifying and intensifying substantive nouns, adjective nouns, and adverb nouns; and d) Adverb as a tertiary category intensifying adjectives and adverbs.

"Motivations of Jewish adolescents in a British Hebrew school: Identity, socialization, and language learning","There have been a limited number of studies regarding Jewish adolescents and their motivations for pursuing further Jewish education and training once they have completed b'nai mitzvah. Furthermore, related studies have focused primarily on American and Israeli populations where the numbers of Jews are considerably larger than those in the United Kingdom. This study sought to investigate the motivations of Jewish adolescents in a synagogue on the southern coast of England where the Jewish population is small, especially in comparison to the overall British population. Qualitative methods of inquiry were employed in this case study through the use of observations, open-ended questionnaires, and lengthy dialogues with the seven participants. From the data gathered, the researcher was able to develop data tables in order to organize motivational lists and compare them to literature on the topics of identity, socialization, self-determination theory, the socioeducational model for second language acquisition motivation. The most prominent results involved the participants' desire to maintain relationships with their Jewish friends, their desire to contribute to both the synagogue community and the outer community, their love for social action, and their dedication to the perpetuation of Judaism and Biblical Hebrew language usage. They also enjoyed working with and teaching the younger children, being able to demonstrate creativity, and their abilities to take on adult roles and responsibilities. Through the socialization process, both at home and at school, the participants in this study have developed their identities, not only as Jews, but also as Britons, athletes, musicians, artists, dancers, and more. The setting of the Hebrew school provided a positive socializing environment which motivated the students to further learn and teach both Jewish studies as well as Hebrew. The participants also expressed the desire to raise their children in Jewish homes, an indicator of strong religious socialization in this case.

Natqgu Literacy: Capturing Three Domains for Written Language Use,"This article is a field report on the results of the Santa Cruz, Solomon Islands, Natqgu Language Project that encourages the Natqgu-speaking community to begin using the written vernacular in three domains where English and/or Solomon Islands Pijin were already well established: church, school, and home, and where written Natqgu had rarely been used. Ten factors contributed to recovering significant portions of these domains for written Natqgu over a twenty year period: a new orthography, literacy courses led by a national, sufficient vernacular literacy materials, vernacular literacy classes in two primary schools, a desire to learn song lyrics, later island-wide involvement of teachers and the distribution of literacy materials to their schools, the addressing of perceived language inferiority, promoters of written Natqgu in spheres of influence, computer technology, and friendly competition to gain reading fluency. A model incorporating analogous factors could contribute to language conservation efforts elsewhere in the world. The use of written Natqgu can be expected to continue on the island, since the domains that have been established for its use represent three major arenas of Santa Cruz society. It is also expected that increased use of written Natqgu will undergird spoken Natqgu and contribute to its long-term stability and vitality. Adapted from the source document",0
Online study tour: China and United States. The feasible future for all institutions,"Chinese and American educators and business professionals expressed the need for students with international business cultural awareness (Green, 2005; O'Hara-Devereaux & Johansen, 1994; Kameoka 1996; Z. Song, personal communication Aug. 2, 2005; Y. Cao, personal communication Aug. 2, 2005). Currently, most of the cultural awareness education occurs through traditional study tours which are only an option for those students with financial means. The problem addressed by this study was how to provide cultural exchange programs that are accessible to higher education students. Cultural education gaps may be bridged through the development and evaluation of an international online business culture course. The purpose of the research project was to investigate the feasibility of an online international business culture course. The international online business culture course was a qualitative, non-experimental, observational research project. The researcher/teacher was a participant observer in the study. A pilot study was conducted to test the technology and methodology. The pilot and full study connected via an online, synchronous audio/video connection. All participants were asked to complete a pre-perception survey prior to the first class and a post-perception survey after the last class. The students' perceptions of cultural understanding and the online culture course room were recorded and evaluated. The study showed that students' cultural awareness improved through an online international business culture course. All of the students stated that they probably would or definitely would enjoy participating in future international online business culture courses. The students stated that the course was a way to learn about another's culture, to improve their language skills and they preferred it to their institutions' required multicultural course. The international online business culture course provides the solution to the problem. The method may set a new trend trickling up to industry and down to secondary schools providing classes in global cultural awareness and foreign languages. The international online business culture course might influence the delivery of study abroad tours or cultural awareness courses in higher education institutions, which ultimately may catapult these institutions as the leaders in the delivery of global education.

"Synesthetic metaphor: Perception, cognition, and language","This dissertation investigates synesthetic metaphors of sound in English and Japanese based on corpus data of over 100 literary works and experimental data collected from 78 native speakers. Metaphorical expressions---adjectives borrowed into the auditory domain from other sensory domains---are analyzed from the perspective of Cognitive Linguistics, focusing on the key theoretical issues of Conceptual Metaphor Theory and primary metaphor theory: motivation, directionality, and universality. More specifically, it analyzes physical motivations of metaphors, explains the unidirectional tendency of the mapping, and suggests candidacies for universal metaphors. As background, relevant findings from the following fields are discussed: philosophy, literature, anthropology, music theory, acoustics, psychology, and neuroscience. Examination of different types of conceptual mappings suggests that all metaphors arise from sensory experience and can be categorized as either correlation or resemblance, although each metaphor may have multiple motivations of both types. For analyzing synesthetic metaphors of sound, the three levels---perception, cognition, and language---are characterized as follows: (1)humans share the biological process of hearing and vocalization; (2)culture determines which conceptual mappings are emphasized within the universally available mappings; (3)language restricts how concepts are overtly represented. Corpus analysis shows that the twenty adjectives investigated have similar meanings and usages in English and Japanese, but there are some differences at the linguistic level (e.g., onomatopoeia) or conceptual level (e.g., metaphor). These two levels are pursued with experiments of two tasks (description, adjective) involving two independent variables: language (English, Japanese) and sound types (environmental sound, music, speech). The description task reveals how language-specific aspects including grammatical categories and lexical items influence the descriptions of sound. The adjective task reveals which synesthetic mappings are selected among the cross-culturally shared choices based on socio-cultural factors. It is suggested that the linguistic and conceptual levels need to be distinguished by considering the semantic network of each adjective. This study demonstrates that the expressions of sensory phenomena are determined by both the nature of the stimuli and cultural characteristics. Communication involves the integration of perceptual and cognitive information, which may be either universal or culture-specific. Thus, language reflects the interface between perception and cognition. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

Language of Origin Instruction and Learning French: Toward a Pedagogy of Inclusion,"It is noted that although bilingualism is not discouraged in the French educational system, it is neither actively supported or encouraged by targeted policies. Comparisons are made between multilingual attitudes in France & Canada & the position of the French language in each country; it is a minority language in the latter & the only official language in the former. Directives by the Council of Europe & the European Union (EU) vis-a-vis the acculturation & language maintenance of immigrant children are posited as a framework in the discussion of language didactics that includes rather than excludes minority languages. With reference to a didactic material developed earlier (Auger, 2005), a comparative approach conducive to the development of multilingualism in immigrant children attending French schools is described; the students' native language is used to facilitate their acquisition of French. Additionally, an art class in which pupils of foreign origin are exposed to French literature, cinema, theater, music, & dance is proposed. References. Z. Dubiel",0
"Commentary: You're Not Studying, You're Just...","As often as language teachers lecture about the importance of continual practice to adolescent learners, the dullness of homework exercises designed primarily to be educational has difficulty competing with popular media designed solely to be entertaining. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to develop ""edutainment"" titles that seek to merge educational goals with entertainment content; oftentimes, however, they fail to achieve either goal & fall instead into niche markets. Rather than seeing entertainment-focused media forms as adversarial to educational content, educators should instead embrace them. This commentary examines how content originally designed for entertainment purposes can be modified to provide natural & context rich language learning environments, without sacrificing its entertainment value. First, I examine a modification to the number one selling video game The Sims that intelligently combines game data from the English edition with data from editions of other languages to form a bilingual gaming environment. This exposes learners to abundant L2 vocabulary, yet still provides enough L1 support not to detract from the game. This principle is then extended to other applications such as music videos, typing tutors, & voice-navigated games. Finally, areas of otherwise wasted time are identified, such as waiting for Web pages to load or walking to class, with suggestions of how technology can facilitate language learning during these times. 9 Figures, 26 References.

Perceiving Emotion in Children's Songs across Age and Culture,"We explored children's & adults' ability to perceive the emotional intent of sung performances by Canadian children who were 8-10 years old. Experiment 1 revealed that Canadian listeners were more accurate on happy renditions than on sad renditions of songs & on skilled (""good"") than on unskilled (""ordinary"") performances. Moreover, children's accuracy was greater than that of adults. In Experiment 2, Japanese children & adults with limited comprehension of spoken English successfully perceived the expressive intentions of Canadian children, but they were more accurate on sad renditions than on happy renditions. Japanese children performed better than adults, but only on the sad renditions. Moreover, the accuracy of Japanese children & adults was greater for skilled than for unskilled singers, but only on happy renditions. Finally, expressive cues in children's sung performances were predictive of accuracy regardless of the age or the cultural background of listeners (Experiment 3). 6 Tables, 2 Figures, 43 References.

"Absolute Pitch, Speech, and Tone Language: Some Experiments and a Proposed Framework","Absolute pitch is generally considered to reflect a rare musical endowment; however, its characteristics are puzzling & its genesis is unclear. We describe two experiments in which native speakers of tone languages - Mandarin & Vietnamese - were found to display a remarkably precise & stable form of absolute pitch in enunciating words. We further describe a third experiment in which speakers of English displayed less stability on an analogous task. Based on these findings, & considering the related literatures on critical periods in speech development, & the neurological underpinnings of lexical tone, we propose a framework for the genesis of absolute pitch. The framework assumes that absolute pitch originally evolved as a feature of speech, analogous to other features such as vowel quality, & that speakers of a tone language naturally acquire this feature during the critical period for speech acquisition. We further propose that the acquisition of absolute pitch by rare individuals who speak an intonation language may be associated with a critical period of unusually long duration, so that it encompasses the age at which the child can take music lessons. We conclude that the potential to acquire absolute pitch is universally present at birth, & that it can be realized by enabling the infant to associate pitches with verbal labels during the critical period for speech acquisition. 3 Tables, 92 References.

The Impact of a Computer-Based Training System on Strengthening Phonemic Awareness and Increasing Reading Ability Level,"The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the Fast ForWord(registered) program in strengthening phonemic awareness and increasing reading ability level in students reading below grade level in grades three, four, and five. The Fast ForWord(registered) program was designed to be used for one-hundred minutes a day, five days a week, for approximately six weeks. In order to accommodate this time requirement, the program was instituted as an after-school program. This study investigated one possible solution for helping struggling readers and provides data to educators for making decisions about Fast ForWord(registered) as part of the search for evidence-based educational programs that will efficiently and effectively assist in helping students acquire the greatest amount of reading success. This study involved 60 third, fourth and fifth grade students reading below grade level from a multicultural elementary school in an urban school district. The socioeconomic make-up of this elementary school is low, with the free or reduced lunch rate at 61% of the student body, and a high impact of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students. Two measures of the dependent variables, phonemic awareness and reading ability, were used in this study. The measures consisted of two formal instruments: The Yopp-Singer Test of Phoneme Segmentation and the Qualitative Reading Inventory II (QRI-II). Each was administered twice during the course of this study: pre and post. The results show that some students who participated in the Fast ForWord(registered) program did increase their phonemic awareness level and likewise, did increase their reading ability level. However, some students who participated in the treatment program did not benefit at all from the Fast ForWord(registered) program, and some students yielded only slight gains. Based on the results of this study, the Fast ForWord(registered) program is suggested as a viable option, when used as a supplement to the usual classroom instruction, to improve language and reading skills, particularly phonemic segmentation, for the struggling reader in grades three, four, and five. However, caution is advised in determining for which students reading below grade level in grades three, four, and five, this training program would be best suited.",0
Cyber Resources for Language Education: Accessing and Using Web-Based Target Language Materials,"New millennium educators are challenged to provide language learners with authentic language input & effective instructional materials. The Internet offers a wide range of language teaching materials (LTM) such as quizzes, lesson plans & activities, as well as authentic target language materials (ATLM). ATLMs are print & multimedia texts & communications (e.g., stories, films, advertisements, & songs) by native speakers for native speakers (Bermejo, 2000). This study compared how the variables--years of experience, ease of locating, technological knowledge, technological access, & departmental recommendations--influenced post-secondary language teachers' use of Web-based LTMs & ATLMs. The sample included instructors of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), Commonly Taught Languages (CTL) & Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTL). A negative correlation occurred between ESOL instructors' hours of Web use & access to the Web. Positive correlations were found between LCTL teachers' hours of Web use & ease of locating materials, technological knowledge & Web access. These results indicate that several factors influence language teachers' adoption of Internet-based materials. These findings could help determine which factors should be studied further in language-specific & language learning area contexts. This study also examined preliminary data on how these language educators integrate Web-based materials into their instruction. Across groups, most of the participants reported using LTMs & ATLMs to teach reading. Many ESOL participants in this sample reported using Internet-based materials to teach writing, speaking, vocabulary & pronunciation whereas more CTL & LCTL participants reported using Web-based materials to teach culture. Another preliminary section identified some instructional resources that could help language instructors find & use Web-based materials more effectively & efficiently. Language teachers across groups expressed interest in annotated lists of language education websites. Furthermore, many of the CTL & LCTL participants would consider instructional websites useful. These findings suggest a need for further research on how teachers integrate Internet-based materials into instruction & how professional development resources could enhance teachers' use of Web-based materials. The results of this study could be used to inform technology integration in language curriculum & instruction & language teacher preparation.",0
"Crossing Over: White Youth, Hip-Hop and African American English","This research investigates the speech of white middle class young people in the New York City area who employ features of Hip Hop Language (HHL) to mark their affiliation with hip hop culture. Although hip-hop is ostensibly multiracial and multicultural, its origins and creative force are found chiefly in urban African American communities. Far from a passing trend, hip-hop has established itself in the mainstream over the past two decades, generating multi-million dollar clothing and music sales. Characteristically, hip hoppers display their affiliation through a stylistic complex that involves clothing, hair style, forms of walking, gesturing, language, and by participating in activities like rapping, DJ-ing, and break dancing. The data for this study was collected over a two year period in New York City public and private schools, and includes 39 hours of taped sociolinguistic interviews, and 15 hours of theatre, rap music, spoken word performances, discussions and fora focused on hip-hop. The 35 informants in my study live in predominantly white neighborhoods. Some attend mostly white private high schools while most of the others attend a large college preparatory public high school. A small number attend New York University. Their contact with AAE comes primarily from rap music, television and fleeting contact with native speakers. There is a discourse of authenticity within hip-hop that privileges the urban black ""street"" experience and places the participation of whites, particularly middle class whites, on the periphery. White hip hoppers' discourse on authenticity and identity reveals sensitivity about the need to acknowledge one's race and class upbringing. Yet the emphasis on multiculturalism within hip-hop gives many young people the license to adopt speech practices that have their roots in African American English. This study looks at how white hip hoppers use HHL to negotiate their place in hip hop culture, and the ways in which they acknowledge or fail to acknowledge ethnolinguistic boundaries and issues of proprietorship. This research points to a shift in the way many young people are constructing their identities in the face of numerous commodified choices, and challenges traditional sociolinguistic assumptions about language and identity.",0
Movement and Rhythm in Nursery Rhymes in LSF,"As heightened artistic expressions of language, poetry & its close relative song are probably a human cultural universal. It should not come as a surprise, then, that analogous forms of artistic expression occur in sign languages. As is true in general for our understanding of the linguistic structure of sign languages, recognition of the existence of sign language poetry is relatively recent. Thus, for example, no records are known to exist of the form of sign language poetry from the 19th century, & the only records of deaf poetry from that time take the form of writings produced by deaf authors in French, English, & other oral languages. Videotaped records of artistic expression in signs date from only the second half of the 20th century. In the 1970s, the burgeoning of cultural expression within Deaf communities, especially in France & the US, brought to light artistic expression in the form of poems & theatrical performances. Much of the literature on deaf poetry deals with common themes such as deaf identity, perceptions of the world, & feelings of loneliness, but few studies have been devoted to the formal description of poetry in sign languages. Delving into the question of the relation between phonology & poetry provides us with an opportunity to review earlier studies on the structure of signed poetry (most of them on American Sign Language) & to reformulate the kinds of questions usually posed in phonology from the perspective of poetic structure. In this article we do not attempt to deal with all of the ""key characteristics that differentiate poetic from conversational usage"" surveyed by Ormsby (1995, 220). We focus instead on those aspects that more directly concern rhythmic structure because it seems to us that rhythm plays a crucial role in poetic structure & especially so in poetry addressed to children. As a result, our discussion inevitably comes up against the issue of the phonological status of movement & its connection with rhythmic structure, questions that are currently the subject of much interest. 3 Tables, 4 Figures, 9 Examples, 1 Appendix, 26 References.

Poems by Frederic G. Cassidy,"Poems by Frederic G. Cassidy Song of the Native Speaker (1962) Hail to the Native Speaker, He never can go wrong! For by some process mystic, Subliminal, sublinguistic, And utterly spectacular, He knows his own vernacular To every last detail — He simply cannot fail! Field-workers seeking to dissect The structure of his idiolect Occasionally may detect What seems at first an odd effect, Yet every item simply must belong: The Native Speaker never can go wrong! Our analytic bag of tricks, Each segment, sign, and superfix Unto the uttermost fud, He knew 'em by the age of six — He has 'em in his blood.

A slip of the tongue perhaps? No! No! No! It simply can't be so — No Native Speaker's syllable Is anything but unspillable; The fault is ours, and we must ask Are we equal to the task? We speakers quite sophistic Of cultivated tongues, Our grammar's pluralistic; Its diachronic features Like fossilized sea-creatures Have gills instead of lungs And structural variety Defying all propriety As primitive people's speech would never do.

For each of us there is a corner of earth, a refuge of green trees, a cover of clean snow, rocks firmly heaving above the sea, unreachable horizons, small cress-grown creeks, hard clayey fields, that we call ""home.""

Mediating Ebonics,"The authors discuss the distortion & misinformation used by the national media as they covered the Oakland, California, Board of Education (OCBE) Dec 1996 Ebonics resolution. In the weeks following OCBE's unanimous adoption of the resolution, the issue of Ebonics was the hottest topic in the mass media. The authors assert that the media have long demonstrated hostile racial politics. They made Ebonics appear inferior, rather than part of the African American culture, in the same manner they have made African American behaviors appear absurd & aberrant. The African American linguistic heritage originated from slave owners' efforts to stop communication among their slaves & their efforts to justify the degradation of fellow human beings by convincing themselves that Africans did not speak human languages. Slaves, therefore, used tactics such as nonverbal communication, changing of Christian songs & biblical verses, & the creolization of African languages with the English spoken by their masters. The media failed to acknowledge the historical linguistic roots of Ebonics as well as the need to improve education for African American children. It would have been more profitable to discuss whether Ebonics could have been used as a transition for African American children as they learned Standard English. 55 References. L. A. Hoffman",0
"Getting Serious about Language Play: Language Play, Interlanguage Variation and Second-Language Acquisition","Language play, defined as a ""socially-constructed phenomenon which is non-literal, inherently entertaining, & rule-oriented,"" can be divided into play with language form & semantic play (Cook, Guy, 1997). Two theoretical frameworks are used to describe the potential contribution of language play in adult second-language acquisition (SLA): Diane Larsen-Freeman (1997) describes interlanguage as a dynamic, complex nonlinear system, & Mikhail Bakhtin (1981) suggests that normalizing forces & individual creativity are counterbalanced in everyday language use. Language play is a significant part of first-language acquisition (eg, baby talk, rhymes, songs, sound, & semantic play). It is also present in the SLA of children & adolescents (eg, sound & semantic play, cross-linguistic puns, ""double-voicing""). It appears that language play has a facilitative, but not necessary, role in adult SLA as well. Further observation of adult learners interacting in natural social settings is necessary to confirm this conclusion. 46 References. D. Ayoun",0
The Fiesta of Letters,"Dante Medina's novel Leerere (Manual para hispanoandantes) ([There Will Be Reading. A Manual for Beginners in Spanish] 1986) is discussed, examining the possible meanings of the neologism Leerere & the challenges to established linguistic & literary norms as letters & words become protagonists. Words in this novel acquire a life of their own as Medina invents a new grammar & searches for a new language. Some similarities are found with Gianni Rodari's Il libro degli errori (The Book of Errors). However, whereas the latter aims at teaching children orthography with funny stories, Medina's book is highly metaliterary & metalinguistic, with a high dose of language philosophy. The book's composition resembles chamber music as each story needs to be interpreted in the key note suggested in the epigraph. Z. Dubiel",0
Skeat and Joyce: A Garner of Words,"Skeat andJoyce: A Garner of Words Gregory M. Downing ""The fact is, man is an etymologizing animal."" A. Smythe Palmer Folk-Etymology 1882 Readers and critics have always recognized James Joyce's intense focus on the possibilities of language. It is evident everywhere: from the careful play with rhythm, sound, and connotation ofthe lyrics that eventually became Chamber Music, on through Anna's predawn monologue at the end ofFinnegans Wake over a third of a century later. Every phrase manifests a deep concern for words as tools consciously employed in the creation or capture, and conveyance, of every kind of meaning — old and new, ordinary and abstruse, plain and mannerist. Probably the preeminent distinguishing feature ofJoyce's work is the degree to which, more than other literary figures, he appears to exhibit a rational rather than an instinctual sense of English as a whole array of strategies for description and expression. Joyce chose this mode early. As reactions ofhighly sophisticated readers to his earliest lyrics make clear, Joyce had already honed his linguistic facility to a noticeable extent before he was twenty.1 Included 1 Not long after their first meeting in August 1902, George Russell remarked on the verse of the twenty-year-oldJoyce: ""He . . . writes verses perfect in their technique and sometimes beautiful in quality"" (quoted in Ellmann 1982, 100). In fact, Russell exhortedJoyce to strive for less technical sophistication, linguistic skill, and prosodie meticulousness, and instead focus more on individuality and even chaos (99). Yeats, a couple of months later that year, stated: 'Your technique in verse is much better than the technique of any young Dublin man I have met during my time"" (104). (By this pointJoyce had already produced the never-published Shine and Dark collection [80-83] , as well as some of the pieces diat eventuated in Chamber Music in 1907.) See also Russell's further 34Gregory M. Downing in the largely autobiographical Stephen Hero (SH) manuscript, in fact, is an account of Stephen's linguistic activities as an undergraduate. To the extent that Stephen's dates matchJoyce's, this would be during the period from late 1898 through early 1902, when Joyce was at the (Catholic) University College in Dublin, from age sixteen-and-a-half until just after turning twenty. Near the outset of the extant portion, Stephen and his brother Maurice discuss poetry as a verbal construct resulting from the closest attention to sound, scansion, rhythm, and stress (SH 25-26), and: Soon Stephen began to explore the language for himself and to choose, and thereby rescue once for all, the words and phrases most amenable to his theory. He became a poet with malice aforethought. He was at once captivated by the seeming eccentricities of the prose of Freeman and William Morris. He read them as one would read a thesaurus and made a garner of words. He read Skeat's Etymological Dictionary by the hour and his mind, which had from the first been only too submissive to the infant sense of wonder, was often hypnotised by the most commonplace conversation. People seemed to him strangely ignorant of the value of the words they used so glibly .... Words are simply receptacles for human thought [as Stephen argues to the rather literary dean of the college, Father Butt] : in the literary tradition they receive more valuable thoughts than they receive in the market-place .... As he walked thus through the ways of the city he had his ears and eyes ever prompt to receive impressions. It was not only in Skeat that he found words for his treasure house, he found them also at haphazard in the shops, on advertisements , in the mouths of the plodding public.2 comments on the topic during the summer of 1903 and his statement that, at age 20/21, Joyce was more prosodically proficient than either Russell or Yeats (134 and 134n). As Joyce said of lyric prosody to the young Padraic Colum at their first meeting in 1903: ""A lyric is a simple liberation of a rhythm"" (135). From another angle, the opening of the extant SH ms. portrays the undergraduate Stephen in this way, at the very beginning of chapter 16: "" ... he...",0
New Words and New Expressions in French: When Children Believe They've Invented One,"Discussed are data obtained in the Grand concours des mots en fete (The Great Contest of Words Festival) organized by the French Ministry of Culture in which over 10,000 entries were received from various regions of France & abroad. Examples of multiple-choice questions on word derivation given to children aged 11-15 & word meaning definitions from those aged 8-11 are produced. Entries received for neological creations are analyzed. The originality of some lexical inventions is noted, but other words were found to be either taken from songs or fables or from regional or slang vocabularies. Z. Dubiel",0
Learning Languages-Learning Early. Practical Experiences from Saarland,"Critical elements of a successful second-language program for children in Saarland are described. Initiated in the 1987/88 school year, the curriculum is based on four primary principles, designed to provide opportunities for practical understanding & experience in the target language: (1) a foundation of game & musical orientation, (2) familiarization with oral & written language, (3) deemphasis on measurement of grammar knowledge & progress toward administrator-defined goals, & (4) concentration on using only the target language. Problems encountered throughout implementation of the program are discussed. It appears that the four-year test run of this program has produced positive results. Students transitioning into the primary school (1993/94) year appeared to be motivated & well prepared for continuing instruction in the target language. It is suggested that transition difficulties will be alleviated primarily through familiarizing new instructors with the principles & methods of the earlier program. P. Bain",0
The Sociolinguistic Status of Anglo-Nigerian Pidgin: An Overview,"The status of Anglo-Nigerian Pidgin (ANP), the primary lingua franca of Nigeria, is assessed in a sociolinguistic profile of ANP, Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, & English in Nigeria. The areal & stratal distribution of ANP includes & far exceeds that of English in Nigeria. Although ANP evidences a core grammar & speaker fluency, it is acquired as a second, third, or fourth language; arguments that ANP has become native to one region are refuted. Interethnic student populations, urban youth, & retail commerce serve as contexts for the spread of ANP, & a permanent breakthrough is seen in the use of ANP in mass media, including highly popular programs & hit songs. ANP tends to be selected for casual everyday conversation by regular users & is the most likely language of code-switching; it is in common use for intratribal peer communication among youths. A shift in language function from lingua franca to language per se is seen, despite the low prestige of ANP ascribed to neglect by language planners & a history of subjugation. 1 Table, 31 References.

On the Conjugated Future cantare and the Composite Form voy a cantar in Modern Spanish,"The overlap & distinctions between two possible expressions of posteriority, cantare 'to sing' & voy a cantar 'going to sing', are examined. It is noted that the two forms do not exhibit the same distribution across dialects; the composite form is found to occur more commonly in American Spanish, in children's speech, & in less formal registers. The distinction between the two forms has often been expressed as one of temporal proximity, but it is contended that this is only one of several elements involved. When they are found in complementary distribution, the principal distinction is asserted to be the relation to the moment of speaking, tied to the idea of natural consequence. Voy a cantar is defined as the expression of a prolongation or continuation of the present, either temporal or psychological, whereas cantare expresses the future consequence of another contingency action, & signals a break between the moment of speaking & the posterior action or event. In cases of overlap, where the two expressions are close to interchangeable, the composite form is seen as moving closer to the characteristic meaning of the conjugated future, & not vice versa. 7 References.

The Development of Code in Soyinka's The Road: A Stylistic Analysis,"It is argued that Wole Soyinka's play The Road (1965) deploys a set of language codes that weave a variety of language strands into a coherent whole to achieve a dramatic effect. A language strand is defined as a language, a dialect, a sociolect, or an idiolect that is unintelligible to all but native speakers. Eight particular strands are identified in The Road: (1) Liturgical English, (2) Nonliturgical English, (3) American Colloquial English, (4) Simplified English, (5) Yoruba, (6) Yoruba Song, (7) Silence, & (8) Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE). Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of NPE as it is used in the story, including its phonology, morphology, & lexicon. It is contended that code-switching among these strands successfully represents the confusion & disorder of Nigeria's multilingual sociopolitical system that are brought together in harmony through the deployment of NPE, which acts as a primary source of communication & identification within the story. 74 References.

English Imposed Sexism in Yoruba Language: The Case of 'Baby' and 'Aya': WL,"[...]it was noted by Yusuf (1988) that the acquisition of sexist English (through Western education) by L1 speakers of non-genderized Yoruba has been accompanied, in significant ways, by an increasingly elevated and dignifying conception and treatment of women.     [...]because of the naughtiness that is believed to attend childhood, it must be assumed to be natural, and for her own good, for a husband to beat his wife.     Notable numbers by such artists include Dizzy K. Falola's 1984 ""Baby Kilode"" and Sikiru Ayinde Barrister's 1989 ""Fuji Garbage Series II"".     Since songs speak for their time or mirror society and are, following Davis (1985, 168), ""a potent force in the shaping of it"", such Yoruba lyrics facilitate the internalization of the attitudes and injunctions underlying the sexist borrowing.     In other words, women have in relation to linguistic sexism come off worse from the contact between sexist English and some non-sexist aspects of Yoruba.     Since both men and women adopt the aforementioned English imposed sexist Yoruba usage in communicating about women, Cook (1973, 298) may be right to have observed that human beings ""work co-operatively to produce the social orders that `constrain' them.""",0

Aspects of Style and Language in Child's Collection of English and Scottish Popular Ballads,"An attempt to characterize the language of English & Scottish ballads, with particular attention to the use of archaisms. Texts include 6,000 lines, covering a period of four centuries, from The English and Scottish Popular Ballads by F. Child (New York: Dover, 1965). Tests are arranged by chronological & stylistic criteria. A brief introduction summarizes the stanza structure of ballads, with an attempt at classifying the characteristic patterns of repetition. Various aspects of ballad language are used to discover & pattern the typical vocabulary & formulas of questions, commands, wishes, negative sentences, & relative clauses. A discussion on dialogue concentrates on the frequency & types of reporting formulas & words of address. Detailed studies on personal & possessive pronouns, adjs, & numerals introduce their typical forms & patterns of use, in an attempt to show how their choice & positions are affected by meter. An important part of the study deals with word order. The natural speech rhythm of English meets the demands of ballad meter remarkably well. Deviations from the modern Standard tend to be limited to formulaic usage & are often conspicuous for their peculiarity rather than their frequency. The diction of ballads reflects their origin & time of composition. The singers may show their individuality particularly by means used for achieving the alteration of stresses & unstresses within the metrical units. There does not seem to be any consistent tendency to retain EE features, except such as also survive in modern dialects. The occurrence of dialectal features in ballads can, however, only be established by another study based on later recordings from oral tradition. 175 References. Modified AA",0
An Experiment in Teaching German in Elementary Schools: Contribution to the Elucidation of the Processes of Second-Language Acquisition,"Described is development of the Sing' un spiele mit! (Sing & Talk Along!) program for teaching German, & its use in numerous elementary schools in France. The program was aimed at students aged 8, 9, & 10 & was based heavily on cognitive studies of J.

Results indicate that the ""critical period"" hypothesis has validity, & that there is an optimal age for second-lang acquisition. Implications of findings for other linguistic & psycholinguistic theories are briefly examined.

Caught in the Web of Words: James Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary (review),"150CLARENCE MAJOR brief histories of derivative terms stemming from these primary words. Among the words explored are: ""bitch,"" ""bullshit,"" ""cock,"" ""cunt,"" ""hole,"" and ""jazz,"" of which he says: ""It is undetermined whether the original sense was music of a peculiar rhythm, or copulation. The latter is commonly believed in the Middle West"" (p. 62). Read found ""jazz"" used both as a verb and a noun in Island Park, Cedar Falls, Iowa. The noun use of it represented sperm. Following the brave and pioneering glossary there is an ""Afterword"" by Reinhold Aman who praises the work as the classic that it is and says, ""the graffiti collected in these pages are among the funniest of all folk speech recorded "" (p. 85). Though I personally missed the humor I agree with Aman that ""snide bluenoses"" are everywhere. They are likely to be shocked by Dr. Read's book. When the work first appeared in its limited edition it did surprisingly receive some serious critical consideration in several journals. Examples: Quarterly Review of Biology: ""... a record, of permanent historical value, of the current American fashions in obscene inscriptions"" (p. 86). Language said: ""To the linguist the terms show interesting semantic changes, either the use of the inoffensive words to express taboo terms, or the remodeling of the offensive words so that they will somehow give the meaning without giving the offense"" (p. 86). American Speech: ""... all dictionaries ... are written to satisfy the needs of certain groups in society, not to present a complete picture of language at a given time , . . they have continued to omit the vulgar words which are colloquially the most commonly used in the language. . . . The many collectors of 'slang' and students of popular English . . . will appreciate the impulse that leads Mr. Read to put down what most people do not like to see in print"" (p. 89).

If the Oxford English Dictionary is a monument to the English language, it is also a monument to its first editor, Sir James Murray, without whose dedication , perserverance, and indomitable spirit the OED might never have been compiled . For most of the fifty years it took to complete the OED, the history of REVIEWS151 of the work and the man whom his Oxford neighbors nicknamed the Die' were inextricably interwoven. It is the story of both the man and his work that K. M. Elisabeth Murray skillfully weaves together in her book, Caught in the Web of Words. Perhaps the greatest lexicographer of all times was a man of modest formal education. In the fields of English and philology in the 1860's and 70's, however, this did not prove a serious handicap to Murray; for in a society in which formal education was still very classical in orientation, virtually everyone was an amateur in English and philological studies. In his native Scotland, Murray developed early on a fascination for the study of words. After his move to London in 1864, he became active in a number of organizations dedicated to improving the state of English and philological studies. In 1858, one of these organizations, the Philological Society, had issued a call for a New English Dictionary on an historical basis. But it took some twenty years before the work was formally begun. In the meantime, the young Murray had established a reputation as one of the foremost lexicographers in England. In 1874, Edinburgh recognized his contributions to scholarship with the conferral of an Honorary degree of LL.D. The selection of Murray in 1879 to edit the New English Dictionary (later named the OED) was therefore widely hailed. That the Oxford English Dictionary took fifty years to...",0

An Example of Palawan Lyric Poetry: Kulilal at taw at Suluk,"The Palawan is one of the national minorities of the Philippines. Their traditional way of life includes practicing the swidden & hunting with blow-guns. The document studied, Kulilal at taw at Suluk, (Love Songs of the Soulous People) illustrates one of their oral tradition's four ""genres"": the kulilal or ""love songs."" The music, a phonetic transcription of the text, the metric, the melodic formulae, a phonological transcription in Palawan, & a French translation are presented. The methodology used is more than a literary analysis, illustrating a way of using primary data (tape recordings) to reveal their meaning. This kulilal is comprised of nine quatrains, each containing two heptasyllabic couplets. The lyrics often distort the native lang, or borrow terms from neighboring dialects.

Some suggestions are: (1) in grade five, ""Neighbors"" is accompanied by a new pupil's book providing pictures, dialogues, & songs from telecasts. (2) in grade six, an alternative parallel program to be used with ""Here We Are,"" employing a topic/situation approach, (3) in grade eight, an alternative edition to the Grade Eight Series, placing greater emphasis on vocabulary & using lead-up situations before the telecast events are dealt with; quizzes, games & contests comprise the exercises, (4) in grade nine, an alternative edition of the usual materials aiming for recognition knowledge only of grammatical materials; larger contexts are provided for each exercise, (5) in grade ten, ""More About English"" needs to be supplemented by each teacher's own materials.

Discriminatory Abilities in Elementary School Children: Investigation of Musicality and Language Acquisition,"Studied is the relationship between musicality & development of lang learning abilities. The hypothesis was tested by means of an experiment conducted in actual English language teaching in a third-grade class. Analysis of the language learning process in native language acquisition has shown that a significant factor is the ability to discriminate between sounds, sound sequences, & prosodic features. It has been suggested that experience in learning musical abilities, also sound discrimination, might be a key factor in helping develop language learning ability. The experiment was conducted on 29 third graders, 11 F & 18 M, between eight & nine years old. Ss had already been exposed to three months of English language instruction. Tests were conducted in short test periods & consisted of examinations in music, Ger, & Eng. Results verify that a positive correlation exists between linguistic & musical discrimination abilities in children between eight & nine years old. W. Kline",0
The Demise of English,"A review of the literature suggests that the reported troubles of English courses in the schools might be due to a wrongly-directed concentration of efforts. Other ways of expression besides traditional lang could help the child expand his thinking processes & are necessary in an increasingly technological society. Suggested is replacement of the Eng course with a linguistic development course stressing different symbolic systems, & a course in aesthetics. The symbolics course should cover: lang of images, mechanical langs, precision langs, the language of music, grammar as a free-wheeling tool of syntactical evaluation, Eng, foreign langs, noncursive expression, & personal development. A comparative method would allow concurrent study in more than one area. The aesthetics course would stress both pleasure & creative thought, & would include the completed production of any medium of expression considered art, including literature. A. Sbragia",0
Learning the Fundamental Structures of English Conjugation through Songs and Musical Accompaniment,"The traditional methods of teaching, using intensive drills based on sentences with no personal or affective involvement, induce boredom & mental fatigue. In 1972, some British language schools began using specially constructed songs as aids. Words were clearly sung & not swamped by instrumental backing (in contrast to current pop material where music is all important & the words secondary). Each song concentrates on a particular structural grammar point & thus provides a natural drill--e.g., the continuous tenses are presented in the song ""Present Continuous Baby."" The best way to present the continuous tenses is to convey them through natural everyday situations taken from real British background, set to music devised purely by British song writers. The themes have been deliberately chosen to appeal to a generation accustomed to taking an interested & often critical look at the world around them. They are not ""protest"" songs, but at the same time go beyond mere blandness. Their themes include: simple country life as opposed to hectic & oppressive city life; conservation of nature & return to it; the pull of home life; eternal questions about life & love; problems of interpersonal communication with which students can identify; problems of adjustment in the fast moving world of industrialization; regrets for missed opportunities & short lived happy times; restrictions on any human ideals; etc. Conclusions & observations about this technique are: (1) The tune is a great aid to memory because the phrasing & structures of sentences are totally involved with it; (2) Because a natural conversation is fast, music urges the learners to maintain the correct flow, whereas in lab work sentences are forced, stilted, & broken by artificial stops; (3) Singing reduces tension, produces a cheerful atmosphere in the class due to the variety of catchy ""moods,"" melodies, & rhythms used, aids the timid, & encourages rapid progress of high achievers; & (4) Because they are carried away by the chorus, students of lesser oral ability will find it easier to imitate the right stress pattern & iambic rhythm of the English language, which by its very nature follows the rising & falling tones of a song.

An Experiment with Adult Students,"Several methods to help adult students assimilate a language have been found. For example, students in the 3-year course can be divided, according to their ability (not seniority), into groups which have names giving no indication of merit order. This mixing of 'year-groups' is good for class atmosphere, but awkward for marking: bonus points are used in higher level groups, & also to encourage 2nd year students to leave the beginners group, which should include only 1st year students. The team teachers work together very closely to insure that students can pass from group to group with the minimum of adaptation difficulty. The goal is for students to speak, so the atmosphere is cozy & relaxed, & students are called by English Christian names (not customary here). They may also use the teacher's 1st name (unheard of in France!). Songs are used to emphasize grammatical points or the lesson's theme. As soon as a minimum of vocabulary is acquired, we use movement & try to reproduce situations. Adults show more imagination & enthusiasm in this than adolescents because they are not so shy & are more highly motivated. AA",0
Music and Movement: Props for Poetry,"At the November, 1973 OCIRA (Ohio Council of the International Reading Association) convention, the use of music in teaching of poetry was discussed & Carl Orff's theory of rhythm was explained. Orff, a German musician & teacher, contends that feeling precedes cognition in the infant, & that rhythm is the most basic element in the child's existence. Thus, rhythm, speech, & body movement can be used in conjunction with musical props to teach vocabulary, reading, poetry, & music. Speech patterns can be used in learning to recognize musical values; body movement can be used in learning to recognize musical values; & body movement can be used in teaching dynamics. Learning involves the child's tactile, kinesthetic, & auditory senses. Orff's method can help students enjoy reading & poetry, & help make syllabification learning easier. K. Conroy",0
"""Words in the traffic: The language of today""","A variety of ways in which teachers, particularly English teachers, can develop communicative skills in their students are explored. Two primary observations are noted: (1) Times are changing. Where once an English student communicated primarily through reading and writing, he now sings, photographs, or acts out his message; and (2) Individuality, and hence, diverse means of communicating most effectively are recognized. As a student becomes comfortable and confident with one form of communication (made possible through the encouragement and sensitivity of his teacher), he will then be more receptive to the whole universe of communication, its diversity and its intricacies, the sly ways in which it influences, and the potential ways it can be used to one's advantage. Good references which offer more in-depth views concerning areas such as visual literacy, oral literacy, the relevance of rock poetry to English literature, and communication in general are included.

A residential course in Sweden,"A description of a three-week residential course for adults, held in August 1971 at a people's high school at Hola, in northern Sweden. The course provided many with a first opportunity to speak English in a meaningful context. They were exposed to real, if varied, native idiom in a milieu in which English was spoken as a matter of course. The contact with native speakers put a premium on getting a description, an idea, or maybe just a simple comment from one person to another across a bridge of words. Language was treated as a cultural phenomenon and students were helped to see it in relation to its history and contemporary usage. In isolation from these areas where it renews itself, language can cease to be a medium of communication and may become as theoretical as mathematics. Approaches such as the use of songs, pictures, word games, and mime were introduced. M. Marsh",0
"Teaching ""French for Beginners"": (B.B.C.) in a broad-banded situation radiovision","It was becoming more generally felt that the needs of the vast majority of students were not being necessarily served by the traditional format of the French program in existence at Lasswade High School. A genuinely new approach to French was adopted: ""French for Beginners,"" a B.B.C. course. The course materials include 31 filmstrips and a similar number of 15 minute tapes, recorded by native speakers of French. Each classroom was provided with a cassette recorder and cassette copies of all the lessons in the series. Contextualized drills accompanied each of the 31 lessons. The format permits maximum use of modern, colloquial /correct language. The drills are conducted in a ""game"" atmosphere and lessons are further enlivened from time to time by the inclusion of a song. There is no built-in assessment of students' progress, and it is therefore necessary to write one's own battery of tests. Reading and writing skills are introduced much later in the term. The majority of students make worthwhile progress with the program and there are fewer drop-outs. The staff also enjoy job satisfaction. M. Marsh",0
Music as a Pedagogical Strategy for the Cultural and Linguistic Enrichment of Students of Spanish as a Heritage Language,"The growing presence of speakers of Spanish as a heritage language (SHL) in the United States was the main motivation in this research study that aimed to determine the benefits of using music as a teaching tool in the SHL classroom in post-secondary education. This research was based on theoretical basis that state that music offers affective and social benefits as it promotes integration and classroom participation, given the linguistic variation found in song lyrics and their cultural richness.In this quantitative research that was developed in a completely virtual mode, data were collected from 29 college-level participants who completed an initial questionnaire on their musical tastes and a pretest to measure their previous knowledge of various Spanish-speaking music genres, some linguistic varieties, and their cultural perception in relation to music. They also participated in the implementation of the pedagogical intervention that was created for this research and, lastly, they completed a posttest. Once the intervention was concluded, the data collected in the surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Then, comparative results were obtained that supported the hypothesis of this research, which anticipated an expansion in the bilingual spectrum of participants and a cultural enrichment after the pedagogical intervention. Finally, the researcher presented the conclusions and limitations that were observed in this study, as well as recommendations for similar future studies aimed at the maintenance and enrichment of the SHL speakers at the college level in the United States.",0
The Pedagogical Relevance of the Historical Precedents to Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas,"This paper demonstrates the pedagogical relevance of technical and stylistic precedents that influenced Bach in his composition of the Sonatas and Partitas for Unaccompanied Violin. By preemptively studying these musical precursors, students develop the needed technical foundation and stylistic awareness to successfully learn and perform the Sonatas and Partitas.This paper identifies three primary influences that impact the technical demands of the Sonatas and Partitas and that have continued pedagogical relevance today:(1) Works by Marin Marais for the viola da gamba. The work of Marais, which exemplifies the chordal-melodic style outlined in Jean Rousseau’s Traité de la viole, offered a precedent and model to Bach in his conception of the violin as a polyphonic instrument. Rousseau argued for the need to maintain a melodious quality even when composing with multiple-stops. Similarly to Marais, Bach incorporated Rousseau’s ideals in composing polyphonically for the violin. The resulting chordal-melodic texture of the Sonatas and Partitas represents an innovation in violin music of the early 18th century. Understanding Bach’s stylistic aims highlights the technical skills necessary to compellingly perform Bach’s chordal-melodic texture on the violin.(2) The work of 17th- and early 18th-century German composers for the violin. The violin music of 17th-century German composers incorporated an array of virtuosic techniques including agile, rapid passagework, dexterous string crossings, and dense passages of multiple-stops. The work of Heinrich von Biber (1644-1704), Johann Jakob Walther (c.1650-1717), and Johann Paul Westhoff (1656-1705) exemplifies the violin techniques used by German-speaking composers of that era. Today, the music of these German violinist-composers is glaringly omitted from pedagogical methods despite its broad applicability to the teaching of the Sonatas and Partitas(3) Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) and Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713) were the reigning violinist-composers in Italy in the late 17th- and early 18th-centuries. The music of both of these composers deeply impacted Bach’s writing in the Sonatas and Partitas. In modern violin pedagogy, Corelli’s and Vivaldi’s music is primarily studied by beginner- and intermediate-level violinists. However, the work of both these Italian violinist-composers offers important training opportunities for the technical challenges of the Sonatas and Partitas.",0
Acculturation through English Acquisition among Catholic Chinese-Indonesians in Philadelphia,"The purpose of this study was to describe Indonesian language maintenance and English acquisition among Catholic Chinese-Indonesian immigrants in Philadelphia in the context of their acculturation. The research was conducted through a qualitative approach that included multiple interviews and observations of twenty participants within the theoretical framework of John Berry’s acculturation strategy, Ying’s domains of acculturation model and “human capital” model of English acquisition of Barry R. Chiswick and Paul W. Miller. Observations and interviews suggested that all of the participants have maintained Indonesian language by using it for communication with their family and their Indonesian fellows. Indonesian Catholic Community of Philadelphia has played a critical role not only in preserving Indonesian language but also other aspects of its culture such as foods, clothing, songs, dance, ethnic identity, ethnic bond, and cultural events. The research also found that the use of English in working place was the most determinant factor of English acquisition among the participants. The second factor was raising American-born children. The finding did not match with previous studies which argue that the age of entry and the length of stay are two most determinant factor of English acquisition. As such future research can examine thoroughly these differences by doing research with quantitative method on a broader scope or doing qualitative research on different participants. Related with acculturation, the research found that the English acquisition did not necessarily promote more cultural and social integration. All of the English-proficient participants preferred to socialize with Indonesian fellows rather than with Americans and also maintained Indonesian values in their family. It is open for future research to examine thoroughly about the issue. Culture has multi forms. Acquiring English as a part of integration does not mean acquiring other form of American culture and advancing socialization. The strategy of acculturation might be applied distinctively to a specific form of the culture. An immigrant might choose integration attitude for language but separation for other domain of American culture.",0
Şarkı Ve müziğin yabancı Dil öğretiminde Yeri Ve önemi,"Bu araştırmada, yabancı dil öğreniminde müzikten, şarkılardan yararlanmanın, öğrenme süreci üzerindeki olumlu etkisi ile ilgili bir çalışma yürütülmüştür. Araştırmada, İstanbul’un Kadıköy ilçesinde bulunan bir ilköğretim okulunun beşinci sınıfında kullanılmış olan Hachette yayınevine ait Les Loustics A1.1 kitabı taranmış ve bu kitabın ünitelerinde yer alan şarkıların öğrenme ortamında nasıl kullanıldıkları, bu şarkıların pekiştireç olarak kullanılmalarının nasıl sonuçlar doğurduğu, pekiştireç şarkıların sınıf ortamında kullanılmasına dair öneriler gibi konularda saptamalara yer verilmiştir. Yabancı dil öğrenim sürecinde müzikten ve daha belirgin olarak şarkılardan yararlanabilmek, öğretim sürecini destekleyen bir yöntem olmakla birlikte, bu süreçte hiçbir zaman tek başına bir öğretim yöntemi olarak yeterli görülmemiştir. Şarkılar, sınıf içi etkinliklerde ya da öğretilen sözcüklerin pekiştirilmesinde kullanılabilecek, eğlenceli, motivasyonu artıran bir ders materyalidir. Şarkıların birer kültür mirası olarak toplumları yansıtabilme gücünden, öğrencilere öğrenilen yabancı dilin ana dil olarak konuşulduğu ülkelerdeki akranlarının hangi duygular ve davranışlar içinde olduklarını aktarabilmesinden, şarkıları sözleriyle birlikte dinlemenin telaffuz öğrenimine ve tonlama becerisinin kazanılmasına büyük katkı sağlamasından ve en önemlisi sıkıcı olabilecek ders konularında dersin dinamiğini olumlu yönde değiştirebilme güçlerinden faydalanmak doğru bir yardımcı öğretim yöntemi olarak kabul görebilir. Tüm bunların yanı sıra, dinlenilen şarkının, öğrenciler üzerinde belli bir duygu, bir uyaran oluşturması sebebiyle, aynı şarkının başka bir zaman diliminde duyulması, hafızanın devreye girmesine neden olacak ve şarkının sözleri kendiliğinden hatırlanacaktır. Bu yönüyle şarkılar, sözlerinin uzun süreli belleğe alınması sebebiyle iyi birer pekiştireç olarak kabul edilebilir. Araştırmada, yukarıda bahsedilen noktaların yanı sıra, şarkıların tonlama ve vurgu, sözcük ve dilbilgisi gibi konularda da nasıl etkin şekilde kullanıldığı üzerine bilgiler verilmiş, bu sayede müziğin ve şarkının öğrenme üzerinde olumlu bir etkiye sahip olduğu kanıtlanmaya çalışılmıştır.Alternate abstract:In this study, a study on the positive effect of using music and songs on learning process in foreign language learning was conducted. In this study, the Les Loustics A1.1 book of the Hachette publishing house, which has many songs in all of its chapters and which was used in the fifth grade of a primary school in the district of Kadıköy in Istanbul, was scanned in terms of how those songs are used, how was the result of using those songs as reinforcers in the lessons, and some suggestions about the use of songs which are reinforcers in the classroom are given.Even though the use of the music or more specifically the use of the songs is a method that supports the teaching process, it has never been seen as sufficient or used as a teaching method alone. Songs are fun and motivational course material that can be used in classroom activities or in reinforcing the meaning of newly learned vocabulary. Taking benefit of the power to represent a people as their cultural heritage, to convey the feelings and the behaviors of the peers of the learners in the country in which the language of the song is spoken, to greatly contribute to the learning of pronunciation and intonation when listened to with lyrics and most importantly, to change the dynamic of a class that can be boring to a more positive one, would be a correct supportive educative application of song in classroom.Along with the above, because songs evoke feelings or in other words stimulate the listener, hearing the same song at a different time will trigger the memory to remember the lyrics autonomously. In this regard, songs are good reinforcers as their lyrics are stored in long term memory.In this research, along with the points mentioned above, information is given on the effective usage of song in subjects such as intonation and stress, vocabulary and grammar and thus an attempt is made to prove the positive effect of song and music on learning.",0
Generalist student teachers' experiences of the role of music in supporting children's phonological development,"Researchers agree that phonological awareness (or the awareness of the sound structure of language), along with letter knowledge, is the strongest predictor of reading ability. There have been many studies which have shown how musical activity can impact on children's phonological awareness, and thus their early reading ability. However, it is true to say that many generalist Primary school teachers do not feel competent or confident to teach classroom music. This thesis describes an Action Research study in which the author, a teacher educator (TE) with interests in both English and music, developed a resource bank of musical activities using just the singing voice and un-tuned percussion instruments to support the Early Learning Goals related to music, phonological development and several aspects of Phonics Phase 1 Letters and Sounds (DfE, 2007). Drawing on the notion of a 'Cycle of Enactment' (Lampert, Franke, Kazemi et al., 2013), the TE then worked with a group of student teachers (STs). The TE shared the rationale for this project. The TE and the STs then rehearsed the activities together and the STs observed the enactment of those activities by the TE with children in the Early Years Foundation Stage. Subsequently, the STs collaboratively planned, taught and reflected upon music sessions with small groups of children in the same setting. This was then repeated with a different group of STs in a different school. The findings suggest that the teaching model and the use of the resource pack developed the student teachers' competence and confidence to teach music, and their understanding of the impact that musical activity can have on other areas of learning.",0
"Nationhood after Infinite Harm: Music, Childhood and the State in West Germany and Austria, c. 1945–1975","“Nothing of moral or artistic value could flourish.” So opined the composer Joseph Marx of German-speaking Europe’s decimated culture from Vienna in 1946, shortly after the end of World War II. His was not an isolated sentiment, for in the years to come, the nascent West German and Austrian states swiftly took up the mantle of cultural reconstruction. Music, named “most German of the arts” by no less a figure than Thomas Mann, played an outsized role in this process. The postwar rebuilding of what remains the world’s densest concentration of state-sponsored opera houses and concert halls at great public cost suggests the continuing relevance of the music of the past in this region. Yet the reestablishment of major performing institutions was insufficient to ensure either the future of German-speaking Europe’s musical life, or the rehabilitation of the region’s cultural authority on a global stage after the crimes of the Third Reich–and moreover, as the silences within existing institutional studies have made clear, sheds little light on why music mattered in this moment. How did cultural bureaucrats in the Third Reich’s Western successor states understand the postwar reconstruction and sponsorship of a musical life that took as its backbone much of the same repertory–Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, and the rest of the Austro-German pantheon of great masters–that the Nazi state had so recently championed? To what extent did the import of American and British popular music and creation of a new youth culture, already well-chronicled by historians, impinge on state-sponsored musical “high culture”, and vice versa? Finally, what did West Germans and Austrians believe music was for, and how did these ideas shift across the conjuncture of the late 1960s and early 1970s? This project answer these questions by examining intersections between childhood and music in West German and Austrian cultural policy during the decades after World War II, from reconstruction through the cultural upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Musical policy surrounding children–as both bearers and targets of cultural uplift–was heavily freighted with contentious debates over the political community’s boundaries and international image, as well as class, race, gender and humanism. These conflicts are crucial to understanding the culture wars of the 1960s, as well as the persistence of conservatism. Where music was concerned, cultural authorities at the local and federal level in both states shared a common baseline position at least until the mid-1960s: so-called “classical” or “serious” or “good” music, however its boundaries might be defined, was not an art form solely for elites; it was for everyone, and its social functions were many. Across a staggering number of domestic and global interventions in musical life–a 200th birthday celebration for Mozart in every country where West Germany or Austria had diplomatic representation; global tours of the Vienna Boys’ Choir that persisted even after other states protested the children’s treatment; the international export of composer Carl Orff’s music education method; thousands of concert tours, conferences and curriculum reviews–West German and Austrian cultural bureaucrats pursued an ambitious if not always coherent panoply of goals. Via serious music they sought to rehabilitate their nations’ images abroad; to save their citizenries from the scourges not only of Nazism and war, but also of capitalism, materialism, immigration, Americanization and the atomic age; to purvey new, and often troubled, notions of cosmopolitanism; and to shape the shifting musical tastes and habits of young people, whose preference for Anglo-American popular music generated anxiety about Central Europe’s vaunted cultural canon and place in the world. Children were crucial to these projects for many reasons: their vulnerable cultural proclivities; the ease with which they purveyed claims of innocence, contrition and victimhood after Nazism; and, within classical music, the obsession with the figure of the child virtuoso, which, in turn, reflected the art form’s highly specialized demands on its performers from early childhood on. Through source material drawn from federal and municipal archives, periodicals, personal papers, and interview transcripts, this dissertation traces the course of music education and cultural diplomacy from a postwar moment characterized by utopian thinking about the social utility of music; through a purported crisis of music education and cultural life during (roughly) the 1960s; to the early 1970s, when cultural authorities in both states embraced a broader range of musical genres and began to articulate that classical music was for elites. By tracing these shifts, I elucidate the state’s indispensable role for understanding postwar cultural transformation, for the partisans of state-funded cultural forms such as classical music exhibited an ambition for relevance and a persistence that one would not surmise from the existing cultural historiography’s overwhelming focus on blue jeans and rock music. Throughout, attention is paid to the role of anxieties about international prestige, class, the gender order, and cultural difference that subtended cultural policy regarding music and the shifting terrain of high culture more broadly. Finally, positioning the seldom-researched postwar history of Austria alongside that of West Germany permits a dismantling of myths about the victimhood of Austria, the Americanization of West Germany, and the historical discrete-ness of the Austrian and German nations, the latter of which was in large part affected under duress after the failure of the Third Reich.Ch. 1: Musical Utopianism, Cold War Musical Internationalism, and Postwar Cultural Crisis. In a 1974 lecture at Alpbach in the Tirol, the Vienna-born philosopher Karl Popper referred to international expansion of access to classical music as, “the most important, most revolutionary and most hopeful” intellectual or cultural development since 1945. The lecture featuring this claim was promptly reprinted in the Austrian Journal of Music Education. I argue that Popper’s grandiose if vague assessment of classical music’s importance reflected at least three overlapping discourses that would have been familiar not only to his listeners in 1945 but to most educated Austrians and Germans during the postwar years as well as to many devotees of classical music who resided elsewhere. The first of these was a long history of utopian thinking about the social power—or in Marx’s terms, the “use value”—of music and culture more broadly that had particular purchase in German-speaking Europe. At the same time, Popper’s claim was rooted in a specific postwar “cultural crisis” common to West Germany and Austria, which encompassed a set of aspirations and anxieties surrounding music and young people that only intensified over the first three postwar decades. Finally, as other scholars have argued, a musical internationalism prevailed during the Cold War, in which the predominantly Austro-German classical canon helped in rehabilitating the global reputation of German-speaking Europe after Nazism and was broadly understood as the common music of humanity.Ch. 2: Singing Angels: Boyhood, Victimhood and the Sovereignty of Austria. In 1948, occupied Austria launched what one bureaucrat called its “first large-scale propaganda” since the war, a five-month North American tour of the Wiener Sängerknaben, the Vienna Boys’ Choir. Foreign audiences and Austrian bureaucrats alike raved about the boys as embodiments of Austrian innocence, cultural accomplishment, and unchanging, eternal essence—the very features that, despite their slippery mix of truth and fiction, supposedly distinguished Austria from the rest of the German-speaking lands with which Austrian history was deeply enmeshed, thereby, as others have argued, concealing Austrians' integral involvement in the crimes of the Third Reich. Even as foreign governments complained about the boys’ treatment, the Sängerknaben set a template for decades of Austrian nation-branding, which also encompassed the 1956 Mozart bicentennial, The Sound of Music, a parade of young, male piano virtuosi, and orchestras that remained entirely male until the twenty-first century. However, the construction of Austrian-ness embodied by the boys also carried within it a set of contradictions and costs to the children themselves, whose mistreatment by the choir’s leadership is still denied by the choir itself, as well as to Austrian artists who didn’t fit the boys’ white, male, Christian identity. West Germany’s use of music in cultural diplomacy provides a helpful point of comparison throughout, for although both states claimed the same music canon and deployed ensembles internationally during the Cold War, only tiny Austria was able to use musical ensembles to purvey a fantasy of victimhood and innocence in the crimes of Nazism.Ch. 3: “The Most Ancient Instruments of Mankind”: Carl Orff and the Export of Elemental Music Education. Also beginning in the late 1940s, quite a different preoccupation with children and music—one that stressed universal musicality over virtuosity, and nature over discipline—became a dominant force in West German cultural policy, then in Austria and globally. This was the composer Carl Orff’s Schulwerk, a music education method using a collection of purportedly “primitive” instruments that Orff had started to create in Munich during the 1920s. This chapter examines the internal contradictions of.Orff’s method and its racially-tinged ideology, in which children learned about music and elemental.humanity by imitating “primitive” cultures. I also consider how competition between Austria and West.Germany over Orff’s legacy drove the method’s global proliferation, as well as contemporary critique of.the method from various sources, including the philosopher and public intellectual Theodor Adorno. I.argue that although the Schulwerk drew on a wellspring of contemporary fascination with the so-called.“Third World” that was often quite empathetic and progressive, Orff’s conception of “primitivism” and.cultural difference more broadly related all too clearly to the method’s first edition, which had been.published during the Third Reich and was often obscured or forgotten by Orff and his supporters.Ch. 4: Sound Pedagogy: Class, Culture and the Mandatory School Concerts in Cold War Vienna and Munich. This chapter turns to general music education in Vienna, and particularly to the mandatory classical concerts for school children sponsored by the City of Vienna’s Bureau of Culture from 1951 until 1972. Via live performances of curated symphonic music, cultural authorities sought to cultivate a new audience for classical music, to educate children about their cultural heritage, and to underline the importance of live performance in an era of reproduction. Bavaria’s mandatory school concerts program provides a point of comparison.Ch. 5: The Crisis of Music Education. Beginning in the mid-1950s, opinion-makers in West German musical life began to express concern to cultural authorities about a crisis in music education. The crisis had at least three interrelated dimensions: first, a severe shortage of professional-caliber musicians to fill orchestral positions; second, an anxiety about the encroachment of recording technology and popular music; and finally, an increasing confusion about how music should be taught in West German elementary schools in light of changing tastes. But due to the constitutional principle of Landeskulturhoheit, by which each federal state of West Germany held authority over its own cultural and educational affairs, collaboration on solving what many viewed as a national problem proved challenging.CONCLUSION: Re-thinking “Good Music”. By the 1970s, the category of “good music” was coming apart at the seams within the cultural bureaucracies of West Germany and Austria. In Austria, the social democratic impulse to build a listening public declined in importance at the Federal Ministry for Education and the Arts and the Vienna Bureau of Culture, and bureaucrats began to articulate that classical music was for elites. In West Germany, the crisis of music education dulled into a “misery”, in the language of one 1974 screed on the topic, and then disappeared from the archive altogether as the notion that music education was to be a field for apprehending the greatest works of the nation increasingly fell into disrepute. Music continued to play a key role in both states’ international images, but the goal of a people literate in the music of the past became less appealing as the hierarchical culture concept that undergirded notions of Austro-German musical superiority increasingly lost currency and a more horizontal notion of culture took hold.",0
Music and Speech Perception in Children Using Sung Speech: Effects of Neurocognitive Factors,"The current study aimed to explore normal-hearing children's ability to utilize pitch and timbre cues and how these findings correlate with neurocognitive factors. Participants were recruited if they had English as their first language and no formal musical training or 3+ years of formal musical training. Twenty normal-hearing children, age 7.5-14.5 years (mean = 10.5; n=20) were recruited for the study. Nonverbal intelligence, receptive vocabulary, and auditory working memory were assessed using subtests of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-4, and Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing-2, respectively. Raw scores were used to analyze these neurocognitive abilities in each participant. The Angel SoundTM program was employed for the remainder of testing. The Sung Speech Corpus (SSC) was used to present sequences composed of five monosyllabic words or five piano notes, created with various pitch contours and timbre complexities. The Melodic Contour Identification (MCI) task was presented only in the quiet condition. Element identification (Element ID) was tested at 0 dB SNR and +3 dB SNR. Musicians performed significantly better on the MCI task than non-musicians but there was no difference on the Element ID task, consistent with previous literature. Musicians performed significantly better on all neurocognitive tasks than their non-musician peers. An order effect was seen on the Element ID task with participants significantly better at the recall of the last element compared to the first or fourth elements. Receptive vocabulary and auditory working memory were found to be significant predictors of performance on several elements of the Element ID task.",0
Acceptability and Outcomes of a Guided-Meditation Intervention for School-Age Second Language Learners,"Second language (L2) learning anxiety is a well-documented barrier to second language acquisition. In addition to L2 learning anxiety, students are often exposed to a variety of anxiety-provoking sources of stress that may negatively impact the cognitive and affective capacities necessary for learning a new language. Meditative practices in schools have been increasingly found to improve the emotion regulation skills of students. A previous study (Cai, 2017) on the use of guided meditation in college-level language classes resulted in reduced anxiety and enhanced language learning outcomes. The current study aimed to build on this previous research, by examining the potential differential effects of guided meditation elements (i.e., relaxing background music and positive suggestions in the target language) in a school-age population. The current study also examined multiple theoretically related outcomes beyond anxiety reduction and language learning, namely, perceived stress, mindfulness, and coping self-efficacy. Feedback from the participating teachers and students on their perceived satisfaction with and perceived effectiveness of the intervention was also sought in order to inform research and practice. Results found that both music and guided meditation were found acceptable by the majority of the students and all of their teachers. Students also tended to emphasize the perceived calming effects of the meditation music. Applied and theoretical implications are discussed with a focus on enhancing effectiveness with diverse, adolescent populations.",0
Statistical Learning of Transition Patterns between Variable Stimuli,"Learning transition patterns between variable sounds is essential for vocal communications. For example, spoken speech usually consists of a series of words in a specific order. Having a variant-independent representation for a word and knowing the transition patterns between words are critical for speech perception. To investigate these questions at the neural level, we recorded extracellular neural activity from multiple sites bilaterally in the zebra finch auditory forebrain while presenting auditory stimuli in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, infrequent repetitions of a song syllable were presented after either an alternating or shuffled sequence of syllables. At all tested inter-stimulus intervals (1s, 3s, or jittered from 0.8 to 1.2s), neurons in the secondary auditory area (caudomedial nidopallium, NCM) were sensitive to the violation of transition patterns. In contrast, neurons were less sensitive to the violation of transition patterns in the primary auditory area (Field L2). These results suggest that neurons in NCM can learn transition patterns between sounds after passive exposure independent of inter-syllable intervals (at least for all tested ISIs). In the second experiment, naturally-produced variants of zebra finch songs were presented in either blocked or shuffled order. The response temporal profiles for different variants of the same zebra finch song were more similar in NCM than in L2. Furthermore, in NCM but not L2, the response temporal profiles became more similar to each other after repeated passive exposure. These results suggest that variant-independent representation emerges hierarchically in the auditory system and that passive exposure may further facilitate that representation. Together, these two experiments provide insights into how the zebra finch auditory system can form variant-independent representations of complex sounds and learn the transition patterns between those sounds. Because similar neural mechanisms may serve the statistical learning and perceptual invariance capacities of the human auditory system, this approach may help us understand the neural basis of speech perception and ultimately contribute to treatments for certain auditory processing disorders.",0
Je ne vais pas parler français à l'école: Preservation of Cajun Culture Through Song,"The purpose of this dissertation is to identify gaps in existing literature and records of Cajun folksongs, and to validate art song arrangements of this repertoire as a significant contribution to the canon of Cajun music. Though it continues to evolve and thrive as a commercial music genre, Cajun folk music is underrepresented in notated form. Transcription is vital to the preservation of folk music; however, previously published collections of these folksongs offer incomplete analysis. Composer Costas Dafnis’ arrangements of these songs for voice and piano have the potential to increase their exposure with classical musicians in professional and academic settings, and also to ameliorate existing collections of these songs.     	Art songs serve as ideal vessels for disseminating folk music.  Through the arranging process, a strict lens of analysis isolates rhythmic structure, individual components of melody, and harmonic function in a manner which may illuminate previously unexamined style traits. This process of analysis is its own contribution to the literature of folk traditions, and offers a further contribution by introducing this rich song tradition to a new audience of performers and scholars who are custodians of historical music.     	The title of this dissertation makes reference to the eradication of the French language from Louisiana schools during the 20th century. Students who used French in spoken or written form were sternly punished and famously asked to write one hundred lines of: “I will not speak French in school.”  Songs became the primary vehicle for oral tradition during and following this French language moratorium.",0
Linguistic Attitudes Toward Spanish in Wyoming,"A study published in 2015 by the United States Census Bureau identifies that the Hispanic population in the United States constitutes 17.6 percent of the total population, the largest minority group in the country. Since 2000, this demographic in the Rocky Mountain Region has increased by ~50 percent. This project analyzed the linguistic attitudes, maintenance, and loyalty of Spanish heritage speakers in Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountain Region. Data was collected from participants in the state of Wyoming who were bilingual in Spanish and English. They were classified into four sociolinguistic generations: immigrant, 1.5 Generation, 2nd generation and 3rd generation. Additionally, focus group interviews were conducted with students participating in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to specifically analyze how the 2016 political climate may have affected their use of, and attitudes toward, speaking Spanish. This study found that Spanish speakers in Wyoming perceive that use of the Spanish language has decreased by the overall population; however, on an individual level, participants did not notice a decrease in their personal use of Spanish. This study also found that the Spanish speaking population in Wyoming uses Spanish most frequently in leisure activities such as reading, writing, listening to music or watching the news.Alternate abstract:Una investigación publicada en 2015 por la Oficina del Censo de los Estados Unidos identificó que la población hispana en los Estados Unidos constituye 17.6 por ciento de la población total, el grupo minoritario más grande del país. Desde el año 2000, este grupo demográfico en la región de las Rocky Mountains ha aumentado por aproximadamente 50 por ciento. Este proyecto analizó las actitudes lingüísticas, mantenimiento lingüístico y lealtad lingüística de los hispanoparlantes de herencia mexicana en el estado de Wyoming, una parte de la región de las Rocky Mountains. Los datos fueron recolectados de participantes en el estado de Wyoming quienes eran bilingües en español e inglés. Aquellos participantes se clasificaban entre cuatro generaciones sociolingüísticas: inmigrante, 1.5 generación, 2ª generación y 3ª generación. Además, entrevistas con un grupo de enfoque fueron realizados con estudiantes en el programa de Deferred Action for Childhoon Arrivals (DACA) para analizar como el clima político del año 2016 posiblemente haya afectado su uso de y actitud hacia el idioma del español. La investigación descubrió que los hispanoparlantes en Wyoming perciben que el uso del lenguaje español ha disminuido en la población general; sin embargo, entre el nivel individual, los participantes de la investigación no notaron una reducción en su uso personal del lenguaje español. La investigación también encontró que la población de hispanoparlantes en Wyoming utiliza el lenguaje español lo más frecuentemente en actividades de ocio como leer, escribir, escuchar música, o mirar las noticias.",0
"Oats, Peas, Beans, and Early Literacy Skills Grow: A Program Evaluation of Education through Music","The acquisition of literacy skills is a complex and multi-faceted process that begins long before typical school-based literacy instruction. The present study sought to examine and expand research regarding the independent and interactive contributions of neuropsychological development, movement, play, and music on the development of literacy skills. The current study investigated Education Through Music, a play-based music-education program that incorporated all of these elements, to determine if their use in an everyday classroom environment impacted literacy-skill development, in particular phonological awareness. Participants included 76 (35 girls, 41 boys) typically-developing, native English-speaking kindergarten students from a school district located in Northern California. Phonological awareness skills were measured at four time periods over the course of a school year using the Phonological Awareness Test 2. Relative to non-music-oriented classroom controls, students participating in Education Through Music classrooms demonstrated significantly higher performance in the areas of segmentation (i.e., using sentences, syllables, and phonemes) as well as rhyming production. Results provide initial support for the use of vocal music in the classroom as it relates to early literacy skill development.",1
Two Negations,"This thesis belongs to the fields of creative writing, cultural theory and Lacanian theory. It comprises two components: one is a work of creative writing entitled ""Two Negations"". The ""First Negation"" is an exploration of Part A of German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (""Consciousness"", from §90 to §165) that chooses not to rely on secondary sources, instead remaining as close to the text as it can while establishing surprising or controversial links. The ""Second Negation"" consists mostly of aphorisms, with a handful of essays; its content side-tracks from what is initially a highly metaphorical and personal narrative into considerations upon the psychoanalytic understanding of time and space, and more specifically the feminine modalities of this experience. Creative writing here mixes psychoanalytic concepts, Hegelian vocabulary and wellknown works of modern and contemporary philosophy with pop music and original fiction. This symptom writ large eventually begs the question of what it is a symptom of, raising the stakes for an interpretation. The second component is a reflective commentary that seeks to put in context the creative writing in order to interpret it. Since Nietzsche's philosophy resembles Two Negations in both substance and style, it is the scholarly material best fit to bring contextual light to it. The first part of the commentary therefore investigates the use and function of aphorisms in Nietzsche's books, focusing on the analogy with the French moralists. The second part discusses Jacques Derrida's critique of Nietzsche in two papers written in the 1970s, in particular the groundbreaking emphasis on the woman in Nietzsche's writings, an analysis that bears on Two Negations. The third and final part introduces the question of melancholia in Two Negations in connection with Nietzschean nihilism and the psychoanalytic understanding of mourning, and closes on the notions of Author and Style in Hegel and French Romanticism.",0
Tyndale: A Reformation Oratorio,"Tyndale: A Reformation Oratorio is an hour-long musical composition summarizing the story of William Tyndale, a Lutheran scholar who translated the Bible into English and was executed as a heretic in 1536. The piece is in two parts of eight movements each. Broadly speaking, Part One examines the causes that would underlie Tyndale’s life work (his upbringing and education, his commitment to credal orthodoxy, the abuses of Rome, the tide of Lutheran reform, and the scholarly call for a clear English translation), while Part Two deals with the resulting  consequences (Tyndale’s flight to the continent, the dissemination of his translation, the rage of his enemies, his capture and execution, and the eventual triumph of his vernacular translation in the English Church). Scored for SATB chorus, children’s chorus, soloists, narrator, and orchestra, the oratorio is mainly written in a late Romantic vein, with allusions to sixteenth-century counterpoint, medieval folk songs, recitative, church anthems, sea shanties, minimalism, and music from Broadway and film.",0
"Pragmatics Instruction in Korean as a Foreign Language Programs in the U.S.: Overview of the Programs, Instructors' Beliefs, and Pedagogical Application","In the field of Korean as a foreign language (KFL) pragmatics, current scholarship documents a need for change in regards to speech styles as dynamic features (Byon, 2007; Chang, 2014; Cook, 2011; Jung, 2015; Park, 2012; Strauss & Eun, 2005; Yoon, 2010). However, speech styles are often taught at a pragmalinguistic level as a grammar point and in a textbook or in a classroom sociopragmatics presentation is limited to static contextual features such as one’s social status and/or age. Moreover, even though the honorifics system and speech styles are perceived as daunting by even the most advanced KFL learners (Brown, 2010, 2013; Byon, 2004, 2007; Choo, 1999; Shon, 1999; Yoon, 2010), the majority of KFL pragmatics research on speech styles focuses on students’ use and production of pragmatics features rather than focusing on the pedagogical application (see Byon, 2015; Song & Pyun, 2011). Instructors’ beliefs on teaching pragmatics and the background to their beliefs are also overlooked.    This study is composed of three interrelated projects and grounded in pragmatics instructional studies, Pragmatic Consciousness Raising (PCR) (Rose 1994, 1999), multiliteracies pedagogy framework, and teachers’ beliefs research. The purpose of this mixed-method study is to understand KFL educators’ views on pragmatics instruction and the current state of pragmatics instruction in KFL programs at tertiary level institutions; the next step is to design and implement pragmatics lesson plans that are more practical and adaptable to current KFL programs. To this end, the research questions are 1) What is the current state of pragmatics instruction in KFL?; 2) What is KFL instructors’ cognition (Borg, 2006) of pragmatics instruction?; 3) Is speech styles instruction based on a multiliteracies pedagogy framework effective and what are the students’ perception toward the lessons?    The research questions were answered through a survey and interviews of KFL educators as well as KFL students’ in-class and homework assignments and surveys before, during, and after the implementation of new lesson plans. The findings showed that the KFL field experienced positive changes such as collaboration with other instructors and curriculum development endeavors based on current theories and approaches in the field. However, similar issues and challenges to other less commonly taught language (LCTL) programs as well as their own unique challenges such as (over-)qualified teaching staff and an absence of equity and advocacy for instructors and programs still remained. The survey responses and interviews showed that both the administrators and instructors in KFL programs believe that pragmatics competence is crucial to developing proficiency in a foreign language and that pragmatics should be taught in class. The teachers’ own personal foreign language learning experiences were very influential in shaping their stated beliefs. However, it was also found that the teachers’ practices were based on their working definition of pragmatics rather than their espoused theories. In the classroom, textbooks provided the core element of curriculum and classroom practice, which the teachers thought contributed to persistently unsatisfactory approaches to pragmatics teaching.    Drawing upon the survey and interview results, a series of instructional units, informed by PCR and multiliteracies pedagogy, was designed to be integrated into current textbook-oriented curricula and implemented in an upper elementary level Korean course. Contrary to the concerns of the interviewed KFL instructors, beginner-level students successfully participated and interacted meaningfully using authentic materials. The students showed development in metapragmatic awareness and in both pragmalinguistics and sociopragmatics knowledge. In addition, the students exhibited positive attitudes toward the instructional units. Based on this evidence, this dissertation concludes with implications and future research recommendations for teacher professional development training design, KFL curriculum, teaching material design, and teacher cognition research.",0
Ethnic Music in Nashville: A Choral Approach,"Ethnic Music in Nashville: A Choral Approach, a six-week unit plan designed for middle or high school choir, featured five prominent Nashville, Tennessee, world music cultures. These music-cultures, selected based on Metro Nashville Public School demographic information, were: Somali music, Kurdish music, mariachi, sacred harp, and Gospel music. As a result of this selection, the project addressed aspects of both immigrant and domestic folk music culture. After six lesson plans that explored each musical culture, the unit culminated in a performance of the a cappella choral piece, ""One Language is Never Enough,"" that aimed to teach students about the music from these cultures in a way that was accessible to both middle and high school students. In addition to the piece and lesson plans, there were performance notes; an International Phonetic Alphabet transcription of the foreign text; and a unit website, which contained videos and background information. This project aimed to bring both domestic and foreign languages and musical cultures to students in an accessible and interactive way that improved both their understanding of the cultures and their musicianship skills. Potentially, it served the purpose of improving the understanding of Nashville students’ knowledge of their own folk music cultures.",0
"Bimusicality: Pedagogical Insights for Music Educators from ""Second-Music"" Learning Experiences","This study explores the development of “bimusicality” in adolescent and adult music learners to discover correlations between this experience and second language acquisition processes. North American music educators need to be equipped to help their students grow in their understanding of diverse musical styles, genres, and traditions, and the ethnomusicological concept of bimusicality, in connection with existing research on second-language acquisition as a sociocultural phenomenon, offers a new frame of reference for understanding how music learners may interact with distinct musical styles. Survey research with a group of 98 adult musicians, followed by ethnographic interviews of 16 of these survey respondents who developed music performance proficiency post-childhood in at least one “second music” style, focused on individual perspectives on developing bimusicality across a variety of musical-cultural settings. Findings suggest a set of nine guiding values that direct music students toward successful and lasting engagement with a new musical tradition, as well as specific pedagogical approaches for music educators seeking to help their students cultivate bimusicality. Finally, these learning values and teaching strategies are synthesized into sample resources for music educators seeking to prepare their music students for productive and satisfying second-music learning.",0
Bilingualism and Cognition: An ERP Approach,"The topic of bilingualism and cognition has been well debated in recent years, particularly in relation to cognitive gains as a consequence of speaking multiple languages. There is a long established belief that the experience of learning a second language, be it simultaneously with another from birth or later in childhood/early adulthood, leads to advantages in executive functioning (Bialystok, 2005). However, it has also been proposed that the cognitive advantages seen previously in studies with bilingual populations are not clear cut and that other factors may be influencing the results (Gathercole et al., 2014; Hilchey and Klein, 2011; Paap and Greenberg, 2013). The studies presented in this thesis addressed bilingualism and its effects on cognition in both infant and young adult participants taken from the North Wales area and the Bangor University student population. The infant study addressed semantic priming and working memory, and the young adult studies addressed response inhibition and suppression. The results of these studies proved inconclusive and suggest that the topic of bilingualism and cognition is a complex one. There are many factors that need to be considered and controlled in future studies with bilingual populations including age of acquisition, amount of exposure, language dominance, socioeconomic status, proficiency, and general intelligence. The experience of acquiring multiple languages places demands on cognitive load, which perhaps in turn results in advantages on tasks requiring executive functioning. These advantages may also be gained from other experiences that place demands on cognitive load such as musical training, video gaming, and dancing. Experiences shape the brain and the process of unraveling which experiences lead to these changes is a multifaceted process that needs to be prudently approached.",0
Demystifying the life and Madrid works of Tomás Luis de Victoria,"Tomás Luis de Victoria (c. 1548-1611) occupied divergent worlds: most of his formal education and career occurred in Rome, while he spent his later years as chaplain to the Empress María at the Descalzas Reales convent in Madrid. This study provides a transcription and in-depth analysis of his first Spanish publication, Missae, Magnificat, Motecta, Psalmi, & alia… (Madrid: Imprenta Real, 1600) alongside related primary documents; the collection includes an unprecedented number of large-scale works and an organ book that is one of the earliest printed accompaniments for choral music. Its contents and circumstances surrounding its publication reveal Victoria’s Madrid-period style, offer a window into his business practices, and provide insight regarding performance of sacred music in late Renaissance Spain. A fresh interpretation of primary and secondary sources regarding Victoria’s life and circumstances contributes to discourse on a number of non-musical topics, and reveals two otherwise neglected facets of Victoria’s personality: his prowess at marketing himself by making wise social and business connections, and his acute ability to recognize the tastes of his intended audiences and tailor his published output to meet those needs. Through examination of the composer’s uncanny networking skills, a clearer picture of connections between virtually all of Europe’s prominent nobility, clergy, intellectuals, and businessmen becomes apparent, as does a deeper understanding of general printing practices during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Additionally, an examination of Victoria’s introduction of Roman choral style into Spain is valuable for understanding the dissemination of aesthetic trends during the transition from Renaissance to Baroque style, and contributes to the understanding of liturgical and performance practices in the decades following the Council of Trent.",0
"The biography of music teachers, their understanding of musicality and the implications for secondary music education","This study concerns the purposes of music education in English secondary schools at key stage 3 (age 11-14) and the role of music educators: whether it is to provide an experience of music or whether it is to develop musicianship in young people; how far teachers understand what it is to be musical and how musicianship can be developed. Music teachers will come from a range of diverse backgrounds, though research data would suggest that most seem to have been educated as ‘classical’ music performers which will have an affect on what they perceive to be central competences in the development of musicians. In turn, this will determine, to some extent, what is taught and learned in the classroom, as tensions can frequently arise between teachers’ expertise and the musical interests and needs of their pupils. This study explores how far the biography of secondary music teachers determines the approach they take to musicianship and the activities which are presented to young people in the classroom. A mixed methods approach has been taken which has focused principally on the competencies and learning contexts required for the development of musicianship and how far these have been observed in practice in the classroom. The outcomes of the study have suggested a clear link between teacher biography and classroom practice but that there are potential tensions which can arise out of school practices, national policy, curricular organization, teachers’ education and training, and the musician-teacher identity. The study concludes by suggesting a range of recommendations for action to the ‘stakeholders’ responsible for the delivery of music education in English secondary schools.",0
Japanese student perception on ambient Western classical music and conversational English education,"The purpose of the qualitative, instrumental case study research was to explore, explain, and understand, through analysis of interviews, focus groups, participant responses to questionnaires and archival documents, how passive classical music exposure during study might stimulate the study of conversational English for Japanese learners, further developing a possible tool for educational leaders to utilize both in Japan and globally. The case involved 12 Japanese adult learners studying in an informal class focusing on improving communication and grammar. Data were collected through questionnaires, learner centered focus-groups, instructor centered interview, and archival data. Themes and patters were analyzed within and across the datum sources for convergence, divergence, and triangulation. The results indicated a favorable relationship between the inclusion of ambient, western, classical music in the classroom and at privet at-home study time. The results of the research’s primary question and 2 sub-questions identified themes between the leaner and the music, touching on the learners change over the exposure period. The themes identified were changes in atmosphere of the learning environment, change in communication in English, change in English study, personal change, and preferences in music qualities and properties. The overall result of the music’s introduction was positive. The learners provided feedback on how to better select ambient music, confirming qualities identified in the literature review such as mid-tempo over faster or slower pieces and music with fewer crescendos. The research also further supported the practice through supportive datum drawn from positive responses to the questionnaires and interviews further backed by the archival data. This positive relation should provide groundwork for on possible means to enhance ESL programs in not only Japan, but worldwide, through the non-invasive method outlined in this research.",0
"An annotated survey of ""Douze chants d'Anatolie"" of Cemal Resit Rey: A practical performance companion to understanding the origin and context of Turkish art song in the twentieth century","This dissertation examines Douze chants d'Anatolie (Twelve Anatolian Songs), a complete art song set and one of the first mature works of Turkish composer Cemal Reşit Rey. The songs of Douze chants d'Anatolie are some of the first examples in the genre of native westernized art song in Turkey. The primary focus of this document is to serve as a musical companion or guide to the performer, demonstrating subtleties of text-setting, expression, mood, atmosphere, harmony, and polyphony of the songs as a means of making this work approachable to the English-speaking musician. Douze chants d'Anatolie stands as the first true song set from Turkey, and this document will also provide evidence that this work was one of the first to embrace the artistic reforms of Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who urged young composers to utilize Turkish folkloric trends and atmosphere within Western form, structure, and harmonic palette. An exploration into the translation, as well as the poetic and historic context of the anonymous folk song poetry will seek to help Western audiences shape a clearer understanding of the subtle nuances and veiled meanings often implied, but not explicitly stated in the words. A selected musical analysis of the composer's setting of the poetry will characterize the work as being based within the French mÃ©lodie and Impressionism traditions in which the composer was educated, but idiosyncratic elements of the Turkish folk music traditions present in the score will also be surveyed and discussed.",0
"Asymmetries in Language and in Nonlinguistic Representations of Fit: A Cross-linguistic, Developmental Study","The current studies address the degree to which semantic representations of space and the usage of spatial words are structured by nonlinguistic concepts that are shared across language groups. We focus on an account (e.g., McDonough, Choi, & Mandler, 2003) that posits a semantic difference in the way Korean- and English speakers reference tight- and loose-fitting containment and support relations: Korean-speakers obligatorily differentiate tight- from loose-fitting relations, while English-speakers do so only optionally. Building on evidence that this semantic difference appears early in language-learning and appears to have subsequent consequences for nonlinguistic cognition, this account posits a restricted influence of nonlinguistic spatial concepts on spatial language.     In three experiments, we reconsider this account, and presents new evidence that (a) both nonlinguistic and linguistic representations of fit should be characterized as asymmetric, with tight-fit privileged over loose-fit, and (b) when these representations are correctly characterized, a strong influence of nonlinguistic concepts on spatial language is evident in both Korean- and English-speakers.     The current experiments build on a prior study (Norbury, Waxman, & Song, 2008), in which we demonstrated a tight-loose asymmetry in English- and Korean-speaking adults, and suggested that it was nonlinguistic in origin. In Experiment 1, we bolster this suggestion with evidence that pre-linguistic infants demonstrate a preference for viewing tight-fitting as opposed to loose-fitting spatial relations.     In Experiment 2, we present evidence that 2-to-3 year old children abstract the category tight-fit across exemplars more readily than they abstract category loose-fit. Taken with the findings from our prior work (Norbury et al., 2008) and from Experiment 1, these results serve as evidence of developmental continuity from infancy through toddlerhood to adulthood.     In Experiment 3, we examine descriptions of tight- and loose-fitting events from Korean- and English-speaking adults, and establish evidence for a linguistic tight-loose asymmetry that mirrors the nonlinguistic asymmetry demonstrated in Experiments 1 and 2. First, we provide evidence supporting an alternate semantic account (Kawachi, 2007) in which a tight-loose asymmetry is evidence Korean spatial semantics. Second, we present evidence that speakers of both languages reference fit more often when describing tight-fitting events as opposed to loose-fitting events.",0
"Volume I Character, Symbol, and Multi-Dimensional Narrative in Three Twentieth-Century Oratorios Volume II Mirror For America","There are two volumes to this dissertation: the first is a monograph, and the second a musical composition, both of which are described below.    Volume I   Oratorios are often theatrical, yet their delivery of narrative and communication of character, unlike in opera, is typically not dependent upon staging, costumes, and lighting.  Through analysis of three twentieth-century oratorios, John Adams' ""El Niño "", Michael Tippett's ""A Child of Our Time"", and Benjamin Britten's ""War Requiem"", this dissertation investigates the ways three composers combine text and music in order to effectively convey characterization and narrative.    This dissertation also explores how secondary and seemingly unrelated texts and narratives may be interpolated in order to emphasize central themes expressed in the primary texts and storylines.  This study illuminates the ways in which characterization and symbolism can be communicated in a non-staged work involving chorus, solo singers, and orchestra, and how multiple narratives may be interwoven to produce a multi-faceted oratorio.     Volume II  Mirror for America is a choral-orchestral collage of the immigrant experience in the United States.  Since it is theatrical but non-staged, it may be considered a secular oratorio or cantata.  Its characters are ten anonymous immigrants and a federal immigration officer, all of whom I interviewed and whose stories I transcribed. They are portrayed by four soloists, each soloist playing the roles of multiple characters.  The ten immigrants' identities are deliberately anonymous and consolidated randomly into four voices so as to universalize the immigrant experience.      The libretto is assembled from excerpts from the interviews, passages from the Old and New Testaments, the Naturalization Exam, a sample naturalization interview from American-citizenship.org, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.      The work is in three parts, each part addressing a specific chapter of the immigrant experience.  In Part I, the characters recount their departure from their native countries, and recall first impressions and experiences upon arriving in the U.S.  In Part II, they remember and reenact the naturalization process.  In Part III, the immigrants describe their new lives and transformed identities.      Throughout the work, the immigration officer interrupts the storytelling by explaining his occupation and stating his opinion on immigration issues.  Periodically, the choir, much like a Greek chorus, makes reflective commentary and occasionally interacts with the characters.  It sings words from the Constitution, the Bible, and English vocabulary from the Naturalization Exam.     The piece is approximately an hour in duration.  The instrumentation is for four solo singers (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Baritone-Bass), chorus, and orchestra.",0
"A Second Refuge French Opera and the Huguenot Migration, c. 1680–c. 1710","This dissertation examines the brief flowering of French opera on stages outside of France around the turn of the eighteenth century. I attribute the sudden rise and fall of interest in the genre to a large and noisy migration event—the flight of some 200,000 Huguenots from France. Dispersed across Western Europe and beyond, Huguenots maintained extensive networks that encouraged the exchange of ideas and of music. And it was precisely in the great centers of the Second Refuge that French opera was performed.     Following the wide-ranging career path of Huguenot impresario, novelist, poet, and spy Jean-Jacques Quesnot de la Chenée, I construct an alternative history of French opera by tracing its circulation and transformation along Huguenot migration routes. This history attributes the lack of a sustained tradition beyond la France not to the genre's musical or dramatic forms or its allegiance to French politics, but rather to the changing social and religious pressures on its primary foreign audience.      My primary argument is that only after they left France did the Huguenots—and French opera—become identifiably ""French,"" for one of the most significant effects of this migration event was the contesting and reconfiguration of the nature of Frenchness itself. Once abroad, the Huguenots were viewed by their hosts first and foremost as French. Similarly, the appearance of French opera outside of its place of origin contributed to distinctions between various ""national"" styles of composition precisely because of its placement in comparison with other forms of spectacular entertainment.    Engaging questions of translation, performance, mobility, and reception, I show that the nostalgia for French cultural products experienced by these displaced persons, as well as the received opinion amongst host societies that French spectacle was of a higher order, created opportunities for entrepreneurs and contributed to the canonization of Lully and the codification of the French style. And French opera, because of its associations with Paris and its focus on spectacle and group expression, became an important instrument in discourses of identity and cultural competence abroad. However, the shifting status of French immigrants during this period limited the usefulness—and indeed the feasibility—of actual productions. In sum, I argue that the opera was itself a site of refuge that could exist only as long as the French community abroad remained culturally distinct.",0
The poetry acquisition and degree of colloquial poems,"Translation from original language as provided by authorColloquial poems, which appeared in late 1980s from the 20th century, constantly developed maturely. Colloquial poems use oral English as the primary language, which is in cathartic potential, syria matter of writing style to show the contents of the emotional life of civilians, advocated use of lyrical spoken to clear the empty lyric and pursues the objective show of the real life itself. Colloquial poems use the closest life form and writing perspective to observe the bottom civilians, and refined into the form of poetry. Access to oral poetry and unique poetic beauty, makes the colloquial poems occupy a certain position, and influence a group of people. But behind the thriving development of oral poetry, it is also facing some potential crisis: like some colloquial poems became the saliva poetry of the poem song; its funny and vulgar and excessive pursuit of poetry is lacking of formal beauty. Thus, studies and discussions on the poetry acquisition and degree of colloquial poems are necessary. In this paper, three aspects on the acquisition and degrees of colloquial poems will be analyzed: First, the origins of colloquial poems, including oral history and the era of poetry background and orientation of oral and characteristics of the identity of the poet. Second, study the way of acquisition and the significance of colloquial poems. This part discusses the features of subtle and real poetry, and the deconstruction and comic beauty of the poets. Third, analyze the writing degree of colloquial poems, which is the crucial issue in the development of colloquial",0
¡Viva la cultura! or ¿Vivan las culturas? Teaching students about the diversity in Spanish-speaking countries,"Research questions. Does teaching High School students about diversity in Spanish-Speaking countries affect their interest in Spanish? Do students participate differently with lessons considered to be more relevant to them? i.e., Afro-Latino topics vs. General Culture topics.    Research activities. This study took place in a non-native Spanish 1 class with 32 students; 18 females and 14 males. The grade range from 9th to 12th graders with various maturity levels, or lack there of, motivation, and behaviors issues within a school population of 1754 students. School’s demographic is composed of a large Hispanic/Latino population (48%) and African-American population (25%). Majority of my students were African-American who were disinterested in Spanish because they did not see a personal connection to the language and culture. Classroom management issues also motivated my intervention, and what the role culture could play in better classroom etiquette. I focused on 4 students who represent different behaviors within my classroom and different levels of performance (low, medium, high). The intervention took place over 4 weeks in which students learned about the Afro-Latino culture in the Spanish-speaking world, focusing primarily in Mexico. Every week students were introduced to different topics regarding the Afro-Latino culture, ranging from history, music, dance, and popular figures. Qualitative data collected were: student interviews from the 2 focus students, teacher observation notes based on behaviors and attitudes, and student reflections. After the intervention, student interest in learning Spanish did not change, but interest in the Spanish-Speaking cultures did increase. Student behavior did not improve when learning about diversity but it did demonstrate curiosity and interest. Students were engaged in classroom activities, but classroom etiquette remained the same.",0
“I can spell <i>cultura</i>… but what is it?”: Experiencing culture in the high school classroom,"Research question. How will teaching cultural units enhance students’ classroom engagement?   Sub-questions. How will deeply focusing on specific countries aid students understanding of their populations? How will cultural immersion affect their understanding of their own culture?   Research Activities. My study took place in a class of 29 students at Legend High School in San José CA. The participants in the study were from my beginning Spanish class. These students were in their majority freshman with a couple of sophomores and juniors scattered among them. The focus of this study came from an observation of student’s engagement. The textbook focuses on grammar and vocabulary but does little to introduce them to Spanish speaking culture. Therefore, I created an intervention that allowed for students to experience another culture. This study focused on “cultural units.” The three specific countries that were presented were México, Spain and Peru. We spent a week on each country, intertwined with the regular curriculum. These cultural interventions consisted of cultural facts, music, food, dance, customs and celebrations. The data analysis consisted of pre lesson surveys, post lesson surveys, observational notes and participation tracks. Overall, this study focused on how experiencing a culture leads to interest, engagement and learning. After reviewing data and classroom observations I found that cultural presentations somewhat increased students cultural knowledge but did increase classroom engagement.",0
Runesinger: A demonstration of coupling Korean phonics and spelling to a videogame,"Runesinger is a demo of a PC videogame to practice speaking and spelling Korean. This computer-assisted language learning teaches a few meaningful nouns and verbs through the task of serving food to hungry villagers during the North Korean famine of 1997.   Inspired by melodic intonation therapy (MIT), the phrases are embedded in jingles. While the user listens and sings each note, a bouncing ball synchronizes the phonemes and graphemes. The user learns a subset of Hangul, the Korean alphabet, through a spelling puzzle. Subsequently, the user sings to same language subtitling (SLS).   The three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment, user interface, and story were designed explicitly for the phonetic spelling of the Korean language. Thus, Runesinger harnesses the tropes of videogames to practice a foreign language in a meaningful context.   KEYWORDS: computer-assisted language learning (CALL), Korean, serious game, same language subtitling (SLS), secondary language (L2), Hangul, task-based language teaching (TBLT), assessment-driven design, educational videogame, neural theory of language (NTL), edutainment, immersive language learning, restaurant script, playful learning.",0
"Drafts, page proofs, and revisions of Schenker's “Der freie Satz”: The collection at the Austrian National Library and Schenker's generative process","When Schenkerian theory began to influence scholarly circles in the United States, the primary—although not the only—work to which scholars had access was Schenker’s last monograph, Der freie Satz. Reading textual passages and examining the many musical graphs in the companion volume of examples influenced their concept of the fundamental structure as Schenker understood it, as well as the relationship of the other levels ( Schichten) to the larger structure. The problem is that most of the second generation of Schenkerian scholars were reading the 1956 second German edition, not the 1935 first German edition. The second edition had been altered for textual and musical content by Schenker’s student, Oswald Jonas—so there is already a disconnect between the original version and the text scholars were reading at that time (the 1950s, 60s, and 70s). Furthermore, many younger North Americans were insufficiently fluent in German to be able to read the work in the original language.    In order to make Schenker’s treatise accessible to English-speaking scholars, Ernst Oster set about translating the work into English, a task completed in 1979 just after his death. The text was based on the second German edition (ed. Jonas, Vienna, 1956), but the first edition (Vienna, 1935) was consulted also. Examples that were changed from the 1935 edition in the 1956 edition were not restored.    The first problem for those interested in gaining a more accurate understanding of Schenker’s theories is that the first German edition is still unavailable in complete translation. The second and more serious issue involves the genesis of the first German edition. All these problems concerning the publication of the various editions have led to an incomplete understanding of the work. Complicating matters is the relatively unexplored state of the late manuscript of Der freie Satz in the Vienna collection.    This study investigates the differences between the late manuscript material preserved in Vienna and the 1935 German printed edition of Schenker’s  Der freie Satz. The author seeks to provide new insight into the ordering of the text, and reveals, translates, and elucidates some omitted text and analyses.",0
"Music in Public Life: Viennese Reports from the “Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung,” 1798-1804","This study consists of translations, with extensive critical annotations, of the reports on musical activity in Vienna appearing in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (General Musical Times, also referred to as AmZ) from its founding in October 1798 (Vol. I) through September 1804 (Vol. VI). AmZ, issued by the Leipzig music publishers Breitkopf und Haertel, was a comprehensive musical journal, whose coverage included articles on a variety of topics, reviews of new music, biographies of prominent musicians, and reports on musical activity from the major European cities. Vienna was one of the first places to contribute regularly to the AmZ, whose readership extended across the German-speaking lands. The reporters were virtually all anonymous (enabling them to speak candidly), and they often expressed contradictory views on what they heard. But taken as a whole, their reports provide a chronicle of the city's major public musical events: primarily opera productions in the Court Theater and the suburban Theater an der Wien, but also academies by prominent artists.    This dissertation follows, chapter by chapter, AmZ's original organization by volume, running annually October through September. Since so many of the productions and personnel are unknown today, extensive explanatory notes are included to provide identification and clarify context. Researchers through the years have drawn selectively from these reviews, but out of context. This primary source study presents them as a collected unit to an English readership for the first time. The story that emerges from these first six years of Viennese reports places the foundation of the Haydn-Mozart canon as a German ideal alongside the popularity of many artists, composers, and musical works that are mostly forgotten today. And although the  AmZ generally did not mention politics, these reviews from Vienna helped to form an artistic conception of German national identity.",0
"The academic environment of one junior high school in northeastern Pennsylvania as perceived by the administration and the English, mathematics, and music faculty: An ethnography","This ethnographic study describes the academic culture and climate, as it relates to the music program, of a non arts-integrated junior high school as perceived by members of the English, mathematics, music faculty and selected administrators.   The study, conducted using a three interview protocol, were guided by four questions: (1) What is the relationship between one's life experience and their belief systems?; (2) What is the perceived value and influence of a teacher education and music programs?; (3) What are the connections between teaching, learning and music?; (4) What is the realm of influence of a non-arts integrated music program? Ten (10) teachers and two administrators were interviewed and created cognitive maps over the course of the study.    The results of the study indicated that the pervading influence over the curriculum was the Pennsylvania state assessment tool the PSSA and making adequate yearly progress (AYP) as indicated in the No Child Left Behind federal mandate. While all of the teachers and administrators espoused the value of student involvement in the school music ensembles, they did not share the NCLB definition of music as part of the core curriculum of the school. They perceived students who were involved in musical ensemble as academically stronger than those that were not involved, while affirming that increased self-esteem, time management skills, and critical thinking skills may result from this involvement. These positive effects, as identified by the teachers and administrators, were seen as transferable to other academic areas, such as math and English. They also felt participation in music ensembles could greatly enhance academic and school success in students that are often removed from participation due to the need for remediation in the PSSA tested areas.   Therefore, increased involvement in music and musical activities during the formative junior high school years is perceived to have a positive affect on social, emotional, and cognitive growth of students. School district and community support for a thriving music program will serve to enhance the academic excellence of its students.",0
"The songs of Luigi Gordigiani (1806–1860), “lo Schuberto italiano”","Music historians have long acknowledged the importance of opera in nineteenth-century Italy. Few musicologists, however, have explored the more intimate genre that also played an important role in Italy’s artistic, political, and social sphere—the Italian art song. This study begins with a discussion as to why few scholars have unjustifiably dismissed Italian song in favor of Italian opera—a genre that evidently eclipsed the recognition of Italian song. Although the operas of Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi highlight the century’s musical achievements, an examination of primary sources reveals that Italy possessed a rich and active concert life outside the opera house. Yet although most significant opera composers experimented with song, only one would claim international attention in this genre, the Tuscan-born composer Luigi Gordigiani (1806-1860).    Beginning with the composer’s childhood, a brief biographical sketch of the composer reveals a figure determined to compose for the stage—attempts that mostly met with disappointment. His failed attempts at securing a career as an opera composer, along with financial difficulties, led Gordigiani to compose more intimate works, most importantly his eight collections of  Canti popolari toscani for voice and piano. These pieces would lead Gordigiani to the intimate salons and concert halls of Europe, places where he would establish himself among the most elite figures of his day. An examination of primary sources from the period reveals a composer whose circle of friends belonged to the elite of London and Florence, including Queen Victoria, Giuseppe Poniatowski, and Nikolai and Anatole Demidov. His reputation as a song composer among these figures and the public brought him the attention from over fifty publishers across Europe, including firms in France, Germany, Russia, Poland, England, and Belgium.    This study also examines the historical context in which Gordigiani composed his songs. Arguably, Italy’s political turmoil, excessive tax, and French and Austrian domination, may have spoiled the country’s piano industry, resulting in a large number of piano imports from France, Germany, and Austria. Nevertheless, the public’s interest for song, whether operatic arias or romanze, brought about an increase in the number of song publications, an aspect that may have stimulated the growth of the piano industry later in the century.    The poems and poets of the risorgimento also investigated. From examination of the poets of the period, it becomes evident that Gordigiani was less interested in the works of major Italian figures like Foscolo, Manzoni, and Leopardi; rather, the composer generally looked to local poets who more likely had an affinity toward folk idioms. Gordigiani’s choice of poetry also reveals that he not only used song as a form of entertainment, but also as an expression of nationalistic and political sentiments.    Finally, this study shows that Gordigiani, unlike many of his Italian contemporaries, assimilated the German Lied tradition. His gift for melody, rich harmonic vocabulary, and clever musico-poetic techniques set him apart from his contemporaries, earning him the nickname “lo Schuberto italiano”—an appellation which begs the question: was Luigi Gordigiani an Italian Schubert or an Italian  Schubert?",0
"The role of teacher social skills in music, math, and English instruction as rated by high school students and teachers","The purpose of this study was to increase understanding of the role of teacher social skills in student learning. The research question follows: What relationships can be found across disciplines (music, math, English) and across perspectives (high-performing student, low-performing student, teacher) relative to the extent that learning is perceived to be influenced by (a) five general teacher traits (organization, expectations, subject competence, non-verbal social skills, and verbal social skills), and (b) six specific teacher social skills, as identified by Riggio in his Social Skills Inventory (1989) (non-verbal skills: emotional expressivity, emotional sensitivity, emotional control; verbal skills: social expressivity, social sensitivity, and social control)?   Samples for the study were drawn from two populations: (1) junior and senior students attending a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania suburban high school (N = 190); (2) music, math and English teachers at the same high school, and---to balance the N across disciplines---music teachers from three neighboring, demographically similar schools ( N = 42). The investigator developed the Student-Teacher Trait Rating Scale (Student-TTRS) and the Teacher-Ranking Scale (Teacher-RS) to solicit student and teacher ratings and rankings of key teacher traits.   Two-way MANOVAs were used to analyse rating data; Spearman rho coefficients were calculated to examine ranking relationships. The first MANOVA revealed that music students valued a teacher's verbal skills significantly higher than math students or English students, and high-achieving students valued a teacher's non-verbal skills and verbal skills significantly higher than low-achieving students. The second MANOVA revealed that music students valued a teacher's Emotional Expressivity significantly higher than math or English students, and Social Expressivity and Social Control significantly higher than math students.   The correlation of all students' rankings to all teacher's rankings on the five general teacher traits was r = .41, and on the six teacher social skills, r = .77. Music students and music teachers ranked Emotional Expressivity highest among the six teacher social skills.   Results indicated that music students and music teachers value different general teacher traits and teacher social skills from those valued in the disciplines of math and English. Music students and music teachers ranked the non-verbal skill, Emotional Expressivity, above all other social skills. The importance of non-verbal social skills seemingly unique to music instruction, the removal of music from the curriculum would amount to the removal of a unique dimension of thought and development.",0
A Study of the Effects of Teaching English Grammar with English Songs in Junior High Schools,"Abstract     In English language teaching (ELT), teachers and researchers have attempted to make English language learning, especially grammar learning, enjoyable so that students may learn more happily and autonomously. One of the important methods used is to apply songs in English grammar teaching.     This study attempts to explore the effects of TGS in junior high schools. An experimental research is conducted. 133 students from a junior high school in Linfen City, Shanxi Province ---- 66 students in the controlled class (CC) and 67 students in the experimental class (EC), participate in the research. Data is collected via questionnaires and tests      The comparative analysis of the questionnaires indicates that after TGS is used in ELT, 51% of students in EC think that the grammar class is interesting, while in the pre-questionnaire, the percentage of both classes is 0; 84% of students become interested in English learning in EC, which is 40% higher than before, 32% higher than CC; and 46% of students in EC think TGS makes the memorizing of the grammatical rules easier. In addition, the comparative analysis of tests suggests that there is significant difference between EC and CC in the grammar section, especially in regard to the subjective items ----- form-changing and picture-writing, in which the mean score of students from EC is 20.63% and 11.50% higher respectively than that of students from CC.     On the whole, TGS has effects on teaching and learning in junior high schools. However, it is not an independent teaching approach, and is considered as an effective catalyst affiliated with other teaching methods, making ELT more pleasant for both teachers and students.

Issues in music modeling within kindergarten language arts curricula,"Phonemic awareness (PA) is described by reading specialists as the ability to hear and manipulate phonemes, the smallest units of language. Prosody, a function of fluency, focuses on the ability to put words together into natural speech rhythm, inflection and flow. This paper discusses the interaction of vocal music skills within phonemic awareness and prosody training in kindergarten language arts instruction. Research is discussed regarding auditory processing, music perception, audiation, acoustics, speech articulation, phonemic awareness and prosody as related to language arts instruction of kindergarten, grade one and English Language Development students. The relationship of music education to government initiatives ""No Child Left Behind"" and ""Put Reading First"" is extrapolated. The California State educational standards for kindergarten and grade one language arts and music are given application using vocal music instructional strategies. The music-related curricula within a state-approved kindergarten language arts textbook are critiqued. The conditions necessary for teachers to provide developmentally-appropriate music modeling are defined, and a program model for collaborative staff development between music teacher and classroom teacher is outlined.",0
Ways in which bilingual students with learning disabilities access opportunities for biliteracy,"Students in special education commonly experience reductionist instruction based on narrow views of literacy and institutionalized, deficit views of students labeled learning disabled. In contrast, this study was based on a broad conceptualization of literacy, including biliteracy for bilingual students labeled learning disabled and viewed learning and literacy through a sociocultural, critical lens. It focused on students'  competencies. This study may be the first to explore how bilingual students with learning disabilities access opportunities for biliteracy.    This study was a critical ethnography of six elementary-aged, Spanish-English bilingual students labeled learning disabled. All received bilingual special education resource services in addition to instruction in their bilingual homeroom. Data collection consisted of: observation of students in their homeroom, resource, and art and music classes, teacher and student interviews, and relevant artifacts. Data analysis occurred formatively with data collection, and summatively to articulate a specific theory of biliteracy.    Findings suggested that bilingual students with disabilities possess an array of biliteracy competencies despite the fact that instruction does not promote them. Biliteracy seemed to occur as a natural response to students' interactions within their sociocultural milieu. Students' abilities exceeded teachers' expectations of them and even surpassed teachers' own sociocultural and sociocritical awareness. It implied that biliteracy is not too challenging for bilingual students with disabilities. In fact, biliteracy highlights and capitalizes on students' competencies, thereby revealing students' authentic literate and linguistic abilities.    Findings from this research support the notion that informal reading opportunities, meaningful conversations, and learning contexts in which language and literacy are integrated into content instruction provide important and  authentic language and literacy learning opportunities for students. Additionally, despite the fact that all the students in this study were bilingual and biliterate to some degree, none had adequate opportunities to use and learn English. It is imperative that school districts provide a structure to guide instruction in two languages, develop curricula for structured English language development (including goals for the acquisition of specific academic content, vocabulary and language usage) and ensure that all students have equal access to it.",0
Giving the gift of music: The educational program of the Cheyenne Symphony Orchestra,"Symphony orchestras provide education outreach programs for the communities in which they are located. This study provides a description of the 2001–2002  Giving the Gift of Music series of the Cheyenne Symphony Orchestra (CSO). The youth concert, Movie Magic! 2001: A Movie Music Odyssey , was the primary focus of this study. Other outreach programs included the adoption of an alternative high school, a flute recital by a CSO guest soloist, a Spanish and Mexican dance recital by a CSO guest artist, a violin presentation by a CSO musician, an Art in Music competition, and a free ticket program. Interviews, observations, and artifacts gathered from Laramie County School District No. 1 students and teachers, CSO personnel and guest artists, and citizens of Cheyenne comprised the data sources.    Primary education goals perceived by informants for the Movie Magic! concert included acquisition of musical instrument knowledge and music appreciation. Adult informants also advocated concert etiquette as a relevant outcome. Goals were less clear for other outreach events, with the exception of the Art in Music competition, which art teachers related to curriculum goals.    Informants held different values for Giving the Gift of Music  events. Elementary students described programs as enjoyable and related learning to other music experiences; high school students valued participation in the community and the experience of producing art works. Adult informants valued programs as a means of developing future audiences, as a source of income for CSO musicians, as an opportunity for corporate recognition, as a means of motivating musical careers and acquiring life skills, as means of providing cultural enrichment opportunities for students, and as a means of promoting music education.    Differences of values arose when classroom teachers perceived that programs were not part of their state and district curriculum guidelines. Some adult informants also perceived the Movie Magic! concert as entertainment rather than education. Recommendations include developing an assessment plan to determine the short- and long-term outcomes of the Giving the Gift of Music program, creating opportunities for active student participation in all CSO education outreach programs, and involving music educators in the planning process.",0
"""Das Rot"" (1990): Six poems by Karoline von Guenderrode set to music by Wolfgang Rihm: A performance analysis","While the art song tradition in English-speaking lands experienced a healthy revival in the hands of such composers as Benjamin Britten and Ned Rorem, the post-Second World War German music scene has not produced an heir-apparent to the illustrious lieder tradition of the Romantic era. Wolfgang Rihm's compositions for solo voice and piano exemplify the Romantic idea of lieder: to synthesize the poetic text; the composer's own inspiration from the text; and the performers' interpretation.    The present study is a performance analysis of Wolfgang Rihm's setting of six poems by an early Romantic period poet, Karoline von Günderrode, titled Das Rot. The study examines the composer's musical interpretation of the text. Rihm's musical language and ensuing technical as well as dramatic challenges are explored. The primary focus of this study is to illuminate the songs from the perspective of the singer as a creative interpreter of the composer's inspiration.    The project begins with a brief historical survey of the German lieder tradition. Developments in Wolfgang Rihm's musical language are examined in order to gain an understanding of his approach in interpreting the poems and setting them as songs. The principal source of any song interpretation lies in the original text. This study, therefore, surveys the times and circumstances surrounding the life of the poet as they influenced her poetic inspirations.    In subsequent sections, each song is examined in terms of performance. Various aesthetic questions posed by the poetry and the music are explored. Specific vocal technical aspects involved in interpreting the songs are also addressed. A summary of Wolfgang Rihm's contribution to the contemporary German lieder repertoire concludes the study.",0
The challenges of teaching Irish to infants through the medium of multimedia presentations.,"Although Irish is a compulsory subject in all primary schools, all other curricular areas are taught through the medium of English in ordinary primary schools. Despite many attempts to revive the use of the Irish language since 1922, the reality is that the learning of Irish for the majority of students is an experience in second-language acquisition. Irish has a valid claim to being the ancestral language of the vast majority of the people of Ireland but nowadays however, it is not their native language. In this study the researcher wishes to explore how the use of ICT and in particular Multimedia Presentations enhanced the learning of the Irish language in an infant classroom. The setting for the research was a large urban school in the West of Ireland. English is the main language of instruction in the school and Irish is taught as a subject only for approximately three hours a week at the infant level.       For the purpose of this research the teacher/researcher designed PowerPoint presentations for use in the Irish language classroom. The main characters (favourite cartoon characters) were chosen by the children themselves. The children were then invited to record their own words, phrases, songs and rhymes to be added to the presentations. As a result of the PowerPoint Presentations the children expressed a desire to create their own PowerPoint Presentations. During this Project phase the children very much lead the learning situation with the researcher acting as facilitator/guide and technician. In the latter stages of the research collaborative-based project work was introduced when the teacher/researcher invited five sixth class boys to come in as peer tutors.",0
An exploratory study of the relationship of music intervention techniques to reading performance among selected students,"The purpose of this paper was to determine if a singing-based music program can positively affect student attitudes toward reading. A quasi-experimental study was conducted over a four month period of time in two comparable Chicago Public Schools. The study involved fourth and fifth grade students, however, no documented special education students were included. The glaring curricular difference between the two schools is the music programs. One school employs a traditional music curriculum comprised of music theory, instrument instruction and history while the other school follows a singing-based program.    Data were collected quantitatively via an Elementary Reading Attitude Survey and qualitatively via student interviews. Both pre- and post-surveys were conducted to show change in attitude over a period of time. T tests were conducted for each grade level at each school to determine statistical significance. At the end of the experimental study, the quantitative findings were non-significant. The quantitative data did not show statistically significant growth in attitude toward reading over a period of time. However, the qualitative data showed that the students at the school with the singing-based music curriculum responded well to the program and found a meaningful connection between singing and reading. The qualitative data from this experimental study gives good reason for future studies in this field.    Student interviews were conducted in small groups at each school. The interviewees shared their feelings and attitudes regarding music, reading and the experience and significance of singing. The responses from the children, especially at the school that uses a singing based music curriculum, showed an enthusiasm for singing and a connection between the practice of singing and the affect it has on one's ability to read. In addition to students, teachers, administrators and recent immigrants to the United States were interviewed. Their responses are included in the findings of this project.    The hope of the author is to add to the development of reading curricula that meets the needs of diverse learners and helps to foster positive attitudes toward reading, especially for students whose second language is English. By utilizing a practice like singing, children can engage in the practice of reading, learn to enjoy it and become life-long, skilled readers.",0
Matthaeus Pipelare's “Fors seulement (II)” Chanson and its related motet and Mass performance editions and commentary,"Matthaeus Pipelare was a composer from the southern Netherlands who flourished in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Except for the little more than two years he spent as choirmaster for the Confraternity associated with the Cathedral of St. John in Hertogenbosch, located in Northern Brabant, almost nothing is known of his professional or personal life. Yet writers of the period hailed his skill and placed him in the same company as such well-known composers as Josquin, la Rue, Brumel, and Isaac.    A small but excellent body of the composer's works survive in manuscripts and early prints housed in libraries and archives of eleven countries throughout Europe, stretching from Russia to Spain, with 26 sources found in Italy. The surviving corpus consists of eight secular works (four Flemish songs and four French chansons, one doubtful), nine motets, nine Masses, and a Credo. From the large scale Masses to the exquisite gem of the Fors seulement  (II) chanson, Pipelare's music exhibits masterful design and an engaging quality for both performer and listener. He and his compositions deserve to be more widely known and performed.    Unfortunately, the only current editions of his works are available in scholarly editions, the main goal of which is study rather than performance, and which are usually larger and heavier than most performance editions. The primary purpose of this project is to produce modern-day performance editions of three related works by Pipelare: Fors seulement ( II), Exortum est in tenebris, and Missa Fors seulement. Each of the editions is based on one of the surviving manuscripts. Copies of these manuscripts were obtained from libraries and archives in Florence, Segovia, and Jena. The editions are intended to be accurate transmissions of the source documents while presenting the music in a form which modern-day singers and conductors will find easy to use. A secondary purpose of the study is to provide adequate background on Pipelare and his works, particularly those included in the editions, which will both create interest in this unfortunately obscure composer and provide the conductor with pertinent information for successful performance.",0
The language of entertainment: Recent and re-activated English loans in the Ukrainian show-business lexicon,"Lexical borrowing is an important source for vocabulary in a language's expansion. In this study we shall consider the current state of the Ukrainian lexical system, which is characterized by extensive borrowing from English.    The purpose of this study is to analyze the borrowing process in Ukrainian based on the corpus of English loans, which were borrowed or re-activated in the period from 1985 till today. The specific objectives are to determine the most salient reasons for borrowing, to identify the biggest thematic and referent groups, to describe the current processes of semantic and morphological assimilation, and establish the degree of such assimilation.    The results demonstrate that the primary reason for borrowing into Ukrainian show-business vocabulary is the need to name new realia, concepts and objects. Among these music terms and genre names are the most numerous. A number of productive semantic and morphological assimilation processes are identified and described. The rate of assimilation and derivational activity of individual loans are also discussed.",0
Musica christi: a lutheran aesthetic,"This is a study of music in the Lutheran Church by means of a Christological aesthetic.  It is a method that has not been attempted by Lutheran theologians and musicians in the United States and only obliquely suggested by theologians and musicians in the Lutheran churches of northern Europe.  It is, therefore, a new and much needed study.       The first of the two parts is a brief survey of the historical practice of Lutheran church music from the Reformation Era to the end of the 20th century.  It reveals that many aspects of a Christological aesthetic are implied in the music of each era, with significant threads of Christological continuity running throughout the history of Lutheran church music.  A secondary benefit of this historical portion is the introduction to an English speaking audience the world of thought among Lutheran theologians and musicians whose work in German, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Latin has not been translated into English.  Unless otherwise noted the translations are my own.       The second part brings together the implicit and explicit Christological elements revealed by the historical survey.  What the Lutheran Church believes, teaches and confesses about Jesus Christ is formative for music as for all matters of faith and life.  When considered in this context music ceases to be mere music.  It becomes Christological music;  not an aesthetic Christology, but rather a Christological aesthetic in music.       The primary element that is new in this study permeates the entire work.  There is a full participation by Christ in music and by music (with composer, performer, hearer) in Christ.  This communicatio gives full expression to the definitive Lutheran motto of ""singing and saying"" the Gospel, allowing one to grasp that which by either alone could not fully be known.",0
The temporal structure of mother-infant interactions in musical contexts,"The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of temporal structure in mother-infant interactions in musical contexts. Although in the last decade there has been an increase in infant perception of music and maternal singing, little is known about the nature of mother-infant interaction in contexts where mothers sing or play taped music to their infants. This research has several foci: 1) to examine the tempos used by mothers in songs and taped music, as well as the temporal structure of the mothers’ songs, paying particular attention to metrical and phrasing structure; 2) to measure the amount and kinds of behaviours produced by the partners of the dyad during musical interaction, with attention to their level of activity and their cyclical behaviours, as well as their communicative-affective behaviours and the infants’ emotional states and degree of engagement; 3) to analyse the extent and precision of the partners’ synchronisation of their behaviours with self, the musical beat and the other partner; 4) to compare the results of interactions based around songs with those based around taped music. This is an exploratory study which applies a qualitative, micro-analytic observational method to 4 mother-infant dyads: two English-speaking mothers (ES) and two Gaelic-speaking mothers (GS). Two datasets of musical interactions are examined in detail. One includes interactions based around songs and was obtained by asking mothers to sing songs to their 3-4 month-old infants in two contexts: no-touch (where they were asked not to touch their infants) and touch (where they were permitted to touch their infants), and to sing to their 7-8 month-olds in the touch context. The second dataset includes interactions based around taped music and was acquired by asking mothers to play to their 4-5 month-old infants what they considered to be the infant’s favourite music and their own favourite music in two contexts: no-touch and touch. One of the most important discoveries from the thesis is with respect to hierarchical structure. A detailed analysis of the temporal structure of the songs revealed that mothers emphasise the metrical and phrasing structure of their songs, both acoustically through their singing, and behaviourally by synchronising their physical and communicative-affective behaviours with the beats relevant to the temporal structure of the song.",0
Music education as a means for fostering young children's knowledge of dual cultures,"The purpose of this study in early childhood music education was to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a music-based curriculum in a classroom setting using Chinese and English songs to assist 10 adopted, preschool, Chinese children and their American parents, to simultaneously acquire musical skills, language skills, and social and cultural awareness. This was achieved through the implementation of a specifically designed curriculum that used songs, sounds, and images from both Chinese and American cultures to encourage language development and foster cultural awareness and identity in bicultural, Chinese-American children. Classroom musical activities included singing, movement, playing instruments and listening and were designed to promote language learning and reinforce the connection, in both the children and their parents, between language, music, and culture. To assess the effectiveness of the study, formative and summative evaluations involved the teacher-researcher's assessment of students' progress via journal entries, reviews of videotaped records of class activity, together with parent interviews and written and verbal parent-teacher correspondence. The assessment of individual students was based on Foshay's (2000) six categories of self-realization, i.e., the intellectual, emotional, social, physical, aesthetic, and transcendent self. An additional category, the musical self, provided insight into the development of music, language, and culture within the children. Upon completion of the study, children showed significant progress in five of the six categories of Foshay's model of self-realization, as well as a more advanced level of musical skill and understanding. The music program appears to have assisted both children and parents to connect with, and form linkages between, Chinese and American culture.",0
Exploring the possibilities of CLT in the Thai context,"The purpose of this study is to explore factors which need to be considered when adapting CLT to the Thai context. More specifically, it identifies factors which influenced change in teachers' and students' attitudes towards change in classroom practice.    In this action research study the researcher collaborated with the four EFL teachers and the 250 junior high school students enrolled in grades 7/1, 7/3, 8/1, 8/3, 9/1, 9/2 and 9/4 at the laboratory school attached to Mahasarakham University, Thailand. This research project drew upon six sources of data to explore how CLT was adapted in EFL classrooms in Thailand. To collect these data, the four EFL teachers, 250 students, and I engaged in a variety of collaborative activities that including: conversations with students, conversations with teachers, researcher's journal, students' journals, teachers' journals, and the observations of the researcher. To translate CLT from theory to practice I used Bilash's Second Language Instructional Model (B-SLIM), Bilash's criteria for communicative activities (BCCA), and Gardner's multiple intelligences.    Factors which seemed to have positively influenced teachers' attitudes towards changes in classroom practice from my perspective as a participant-observer-facilitator of this action research project are: applying B-SLIM in the classroom; opportunities for guided practice; sharing knowledge and ideas; learning to critique; overturning doubt.    Factors which influenced students' attitudes towards changes in classroom practice include: variety of activities; active participation; responding to their ideas; learner-teacher relationship; student input and the role of grammar; kinesthetic learning; and value of Pop-Rock Music, B-SLIM, and test anxiety.",0
Children's song -makers as messengers of hope: Participatory research with implications for teacher educators,"Pete Seeger, Ells Jenkins, Suni Paz and six other leading children's musicians in the U.S. contributed their experience to this study about the crucial role of music and singing for social justice in children's lives and its shrinking presence in U.S. pre-school and elementary schools. The study built its theoretical framework on arts and music education, transformative education, and folk and socially conscious children's music. Participatory research, based on the revolutionary education theories of Paulo Freire, guided the dialogues with the participants. These activist singer-songwriters were asked how they define social justice, how they involve children in singing, and what songs are especially effective in raising social consciousness with children. They were also asked which factors are causing the decline in children's singing in schools today, and what parents, teachers, teacher-educators, and musicians can do to help children develop greater self-expression, literacy, and social commitment through song-making. The findings revealed consensus about the power of music to convey the values of fairness and sharing among children. Other themes discussed were multiculturalism, overcoming biases, critical thinking, second language acquisition, and conflict resolution. Transformative song-making was found to involve a wide variety of skills: singing, song-leading, song-writing, storytelling, using games and humor, and performing. All are aimed at involving children in participatory singing that is fun and helps them to imagine and create a more just world. The study found many factors that diminish music in schools, from the general impact of the media and consumerism to the specific ways that high stakes testing and the accountability movement are narrowing curriculum. It also provided an extensive list of suggestions from the participants on how to foster singing and music programs that address social justice in elementary schools and pre-schools, including an increased role for outside artists and musicians, better support for classroom teachers who lack confidence in song-making, and the reemphasis of children's music in teacher-preparation programs. The researcher concludes with specific recommendations for action directed to parents, elementary school teachers and administrators, teacher education institutions, and advocates of children's music and social justice education.",0
"Utilization of computer technology by teachers at Carl Schurz High School, a Chicago public school","This case study investigated computer use by teachers at Schurz High School and identified the factors affecting their use. Current and desired computer skills were also evaluated to make appropriate recommendations regarding inservice training to help increase the use of computers among faculty at Schurz.    Descriptive data was gathered on Schurz by interviews, sign-up sheets, software documentation, and reports and pertained to demographics, academic probation, technology plan, school improvement plan, staff development, funding, computer inventory, computer labs, vocational educational programs, and technology support. A survey was used to gather descriptive information on how computers were used in classrooms and interactive labs. Survey items were designed and revised to gather data relevant to seven research questions.    The population for this study involved the 133 classroom teachers on staff at Schurz High school during the first semester of the 1998–99 school year. One hundred usable surveys represented a response rate of 75%. The respondents represented 12 departments in the school, including business/computer education, math, physical education, English, special education, technical, foreign language, science, music, social studies, art, and English as a Secondary Language.    The major findings of this study show that the vast majority of teachers used a computer for personal or school use; almost all teachers with 1–10 years of teaching used a computer; teachers with 31–35 years of teaching represented the largest group of noncomputer users; the highest percentage of use for both computers and the Internet was for preparing instructional materials; the lowest percentage of use of computers and the Internet was for instructional use for students; teachers used word processing the most for preparing instructional materials, for instructing students in the classrooms, and in the interactive labs; the second greatest computer use was for web searching; and few teachers used software other than word processing in their classrooms.    The factors that affected computer use included the direct relation between use of computers and number of computers in the classroom; lack of computer projection devices in the classrooms; lack of duty-free time to prepare lessons including technology; other educational commitments; and insufficient teacher training, support, and follow-up.",0
Once and future teaching: A case study of the impact of an alternative teaching environment on the pedagogical content knowledge of experienced English language arts teachers,"This research report is a case study of three experienced English language arts teachers and their experiences in an atypical high school setting. The Academy for the Arts, Science and Technology is a public school in South Carolina open to eleventh and twelfth graders who wish to specialize in one of the ten “majors” offered by the school: Pre-engineering, Health Occupations, Horticulture/Golf course Landscaping, Theater, Dance, Music, Advanced Visual Arts, Entertainment Technology, Hospitality and Tourism, and Education. The English teachers in this study worked on teams made up of three or four Majors teachers and a core of academic teachers. In addition to the Majors and teaming, there are four other structural/organizational components of the Academy school which make it unique: the Academic Core and Life Skills Competencies which each student is required to master; the flexible scheduling; the A,B,C Not Yet grading system; and the Senior Exhibition of Mastery. The purpose of this research study was to investigate the impact of this unique school environment on the pedagogical content knowledge of the three English language arts teachers, each of who had fifteen or more years of prior experience in teaching before joining the Academy faculty. The research question for this study was as follows: “In what way does the alternative environment of the school in which the three teachers work impact their pedagogical content knowledge, which includes: (1) knowledge and beliefs about the purposes of teaching the English language arts, (2) knowledge of students, (3) curricular knowledge, and (4) knowledge of instructional strategies?”    Six primary sources of data collection were utilized for this research study: open-ended ethnographic interviews with the teachers; document analyses of the teachers' narratives, notes, and classroom materials; a teacher questionnaire developed by the researcher; pre- and post-pie charts; the Teacher Beliefs Survey developed by Midcontinent Regional Educational Laboratory (1991); and stimulated recall protocols related to videotaped Senior Exhibitions of Mastery.    Data from these sources were identified, coded and categorized according to Grossman's (1990) established rubric for the four components of pedagogical content knowledge. From the coding emerged twelve possible domains. Further analysis using a constant-comparative methodology resulted in six significant themes.    The study found that the unique school environment in which the three English teachers were acculturated did result in changes in their pedagogical content knowledge. The teachers' beliefs and knowledge about the purposes of teaching the English language arts were altered in three ways: (1) they realized a more balanced approach to teaching all five essential skills in the English language arts (reading, writing, speaking, listening and viewing); (2) they came to believe that the integration of academic and vocational curriculum was a more effective way of teaching the English language arts; and (3) they invested more in preparing their students for the “real world” beyond college and technical schools. In regard to their understanding or knowledge of their students, the teachers in this study gained a greater appreciation for the “whole child” in their classrooms. The teachers' curricular knowledge was expanded to include more research and technology because of the school setting of which they were a part, and their instructional planning strategies were significantly altered in order to teach students to be independent learners.",0
An examination of the conducting method of Hideo Saito,"The ideas of Hideo Saito regarding conducting and conducting pedagogy are a valuable addition to the field, an addition that English-speaking people are likely to be unfamiliar with. Besides devising a unique collection of terms for talking about conducting, and assembling a set of exercises designed to facilitate the practice of a variety of gestures, Saito develops and operates from a framework which allows for the description and evaluation of almost any conceivable rhythmic gesture. While he pays attention to time, space, direction, size, and expectations, he often explores the ways velocity and changes in velocity can be employed to elicit desired sounds from players and singers. He is certainly not the first teacher to focus on the role of velocity in conducting gestures. However, the level of sophistication and thoroughness of his examination of velocity, and changes in velocity, is unique. His diagrams are noteworthy as well.    Saito's conducting method is very popular in Japan. Seiji Ozawa, the Music Director/Conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for more than 25 years, is just one of Saito's students who have had very successful conducting careers.    This dissertation, in combination with accompanying videotaped examples of Morihiro Okabe teaching in the authentic Saito tradition, will provide the reader with an introduction to and an evaluation of the Saito conducting method. The reader will learn how to interpret Saito's diagrams of conducting motions, discover who the key people are, and view a Saito teacher instructing students. The reader will be introduced to the core teachings of Professor Saito, see what Saito's primary musical exercises are, and see how these exercises are used to promote musical and technical competence in conducting. This dissertation seeks to give the reader a foundation for further investigation of Saito's ideas and practices.    This dissertation proposes, and employs English names for many gestures Saito labeled in Japanese. The Japanese terms are very descriptive of the motions. Providing equally descriptive English terms should be helpful to readers who are not fluent in Japanese.",0
“Cri de terre”: A translation of Raymond Guy LeBlanc's “Cri de terre”,"When Les Editions d'Acadie first published Raymond Guy LeBlanc's volume of poetry, Cri de terre, in 1972, few could have predicted its impact. LeBlanc had been publishing poems in local newspapers for several Years at the time of Cri de terre's publication and was well recognized in the close-knit community of Acadian poets, artists and musicians who were making their presence known in the Moncton, New Brunswick, area in the late sixties and early seventies. Yet, Cri de terre received more attention than such local recognition would normally produce. In it, the Acadians of New Brunswick and elsewhere recognized themselves and found in the appeal of LeBlanc's poetics a distinctly Acadian identity. The exploration of this identity is one of the primary goals of this study. The other is the rendering of Cri de terre, in its entirety, into English. Because French is the language of the Acadians, their literature, and most studies on the subject, my decision to work in English may seem unusual. However, it is precisely because Acadian Studies have been primarily conducted in French that I have chosen to work in English. By translating these poems, I hope to add to the growing number of Acadian texts available in English so that English-speaking readers will see that Acadian literature is alive, vibrant and distinctly Acadian. The ultimate goal of this thesis, then, is to translate LeBlanc's Cri de terre and to provide an introduction that will open to anglophone readers a sense of one poet's and one translator's quest for an Acadian identity.",0
The effect of instrumental music instruction on academic achievement,"The primary purpose of this study was to compare the academic profiles of high school instrumental music students to high school students with no participation in music instruction. GPA and proficiency scores were examined over a 5-year period in the subject areas of English, mathematics, science, social science, reading, writing and language to assess achievement differences between groups.    Comparisons were made between 11$\rm\sp{th}$ grade students $(N=1,415)$ from the Clovis (CA) Unified School District, enrolled in during the 1996-97 academic year. The experimental group (Instrumental, $n=103)$ consisted of students enrolled in 3 or more years of instrumental music courses from grades 7 through 11. The comparison group (No Music, $n=929)$ students had no participation in any school music courses during the same 5-year period. Two other groups were included for discussion, Other Music $(n=108)$ students enrolled in 3 or more years non-instrumental music courses, and Some Music $(n=275)$ students with 1 or 2 years participation in either instrumental or non-instrumental courses.    Results of the study revealed (1) a slight decline in overall mean GPA for both groups in all subject matter areas, (2) that Instrumental declines were less severe than No Music students, and therefore (3) that the divergent patterns in GPA trends between groups confirmed the positive relationship between instrumental music instruction and broadening academic success. Comparison of mean proficiency scores revealed compelling performance records for Instrumental students, specifically, that differences in content mastery increased annually in favor of Instrumental students. Analysis of attendance patterns also showed Instrumental students had developed better attendance behavior patterns through fewer unexcused absences than did the control group.    The inclusion of discussion groups yielded important evidence in support of long-term instrumental music study. Analysis revealed that academic trends of short-term music students mirrored trends of the No Music group. The results of this study suggested that positive trends in academic achievement and attendance developed in favor of the experimental group over a critical five-year period, and that long-term participation in instrumental music programs coincided with significant increases in academic success.",0
An instructional model for facilitating second language acquisition integrating the Suzuki philosophy of learning and Krashen's Natural Approach,"This qualitative study investigated the use of music in second language acquisition. Documentary data were collected, analyzed, and organized thematically. The author developed a second language learning model which integrates aspects of the Suzuki philosophy of learning and Krashen's Natural Approach. These methods possess strong similarities in their concepts and philosophies which naturally fit together and compliment each other in second language teaching.    It was concluded that the process of communicative competence may indeed be enhanced as a result of integrating music with second language teaching. The model developed by integrating the Suzuki Method and the Krashen Approach produced findings that would support the writer's thesis that music serves as a vehicle to facilitate language learning. Both Krashen and Suzuki promote a healthy positive attitude to learning by providing a nurturing friendly environment which does not put demands on students to perform before they feel they are ready. Children are taught how to learn and the importance of practise. Practise is presented as interesting and fun using a variety of techniques which also include home practise with parental participation.",1
"An investigation into the characteristics, perceptions, and expectations of high school students involved in a pilot statewide Tech Prep in Agriculture Program in Washington State","The purpose of the investigation was to develop a profile of characteristics, perceptions and expectations of high school students involved in the Washington Tech Prep in Agriculture Statewide Articulation Program (TPAG). The investigation involved nine individual interviews, the responses of 165 students to a forced response survey instrument, and a concluding group interview of a group of students who had previously responded to the survey instrument. The criterion for inclusion in the study was involvement with the Tech Prep in Agriculture Articulation program. Thus, participation was purposeful.    The subject students, who were involved in a career cluster-specific program, displayed a rich range of career aspirations and educational characteristics. Career aspirations were not limited to the agricultural career cluster and ranged from accountant to x-ray technician. The subject students came from all four quartiles of the high school population and their future educational aspirations included apprenticeship, community/technical college, four year college, and post-graduate programs. Most students aspired to post-secondary education at a community, technical, or four year college. Of those aspiring to a post-secondary education, most aspired to a community/technical college education.    Surveyed students rated the importance of 24 skills. Workplace skills such as working with others, communications, and the ability to learn rated highest. Foundation skills such as basic mathematics, creativity, and computer usage rated well. Skills related to specific careers fell lower on the composite ratings. Rated lowest were the appreciation of art, music, literature, plays, movies, and TV.    Students rated parents, high school teachers, and young people working in the student's area of career interest the highest as providers of information on education and careers. Individuals such as media journalists and politicians whom society might consider good advisors were not trusted by nearly one of three studied students.    The investigation led to almost immediate improvements in the TPAG Program, including modification of a core course to better reflect student career interests, publication of program literature in Spanish, and gender balancing of images used in brochures. Recommendations for further research into student characteristics, the dynamics of student career selection, and high school career cluster educational models were presented.",0
"A critical performing edition of selected songs from ""Chants d'Auvergne"" collected and harmonized by Joseph Canteloube","This Critical Edition of selected songs from the Chants d'Auvergne, collected and harmonized by Joseph Canteloube, is intended for use as a guide for the performer. The primary focus is the pronunciation of the Auvergnat dialect. For each of the songs there is an International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription of the Auvergnat poems found both in the body of the thesis and in the scores at the end of the edition (permission granted from Editions Alphonse Leduc, formerly Heugel et Cie.). Also included for each song are poems in the original language, their French translations, poetic English translations, and brief commentaries. In addition, there is a biography of the composer Joseph Canteloube, and a chapter on the IPA, including a pronunciation chart for the symbols used in this edition. The primary sources consulted were: M. Jean Fay of Aurillac, France, a linguist and retired professor of Occitan, and Castilian, and a native speaker of Auvergnat; language texts for Occitan, French, Castilian, and other languages; and diction and IPA texts. Interviews were conducted with Auvergnat speakers in France.    The written portrayal of sounds is not an exact science. Therefore, transcription of a dialect, a spoken form of language, is a subjective undertaking. Many discrepancies in orthography and pronunciation were found when researching the texts of these songs. The older people in Auvergne knew many of the songs and were able to sing them, but their pronunciations varied as much as their melodies. As with any folk-art (songs, stories, dances) which is passed on by oral tradition, variations and transformations occur naturally in the transmission from one person to the next. For this reason an Auvergnat linguist was consulted in order to develop a viable pronunciation of this dialect which pertains particularly to lyric diction for the singer. The version found here is simply one interpretation and was undertaken in an effort to achieve a standardization for the pronunciation of the texts of these songs so that they will be more approachable by singers who are familiar with the International Phonetic Alphabet, yet unfamiliar with this relatively obscure dialect.",0
The effects of prenatal language stimulation on human cognitive development,"Most research done on the postnatal effects of externally-presented, prenatal auditory stimulation has been conducted with music, heart rhythms, and language sounds such as voices and songs. The literature is absent in an exploration of the discrimination of foreign language phonemes presented prenatally. The present study was conducted to determine whether newborns could differentiate language sounds heard prenatally from phonemes not previously heard. Twelve fetuses from exclusively English speaking families were exposed to either English language sounds (control group) or Japanese language sounds (experimental group) for 10 minutes each day during the last 2 weeks before their expected delivery date. Three days after birth these infants' heartrates, movements, and states were measured while they were being auditorially stimulated with English and Japanese language sounds to determine their discrimination of the language sounds to which they were exposed in utero. Although not significant at the p $<$.05 level, the group differences were all in the expected direction. Analysis of covariance revealed some variances but not enough to bring statistical significance. Group differences may exist, but were unable to be detected due to small sample size. These results, while not significant, show a trend consistent with evidence that suggests that the human fetus is capable of hearing language sounds in utero and recalling those familiar sounds three days after birth.    A path analysis was conducted to determine at what point infants completed the initial orienting response characterized by accelerated heartrates and movements and began to habituate to familiar sounds. These results were also not found to be statistically significant. Although, a consistent pattern of greater heartrate and movement readings during the first 30 seconds of simulation than in the second and third 30 second periods appeared. This trend supports the literature which indicates that 30 seconds is long enough to allow for the initial orienting response to wane and begin reliable recordings of infant heartrate and movement.",0
Music education at English boys' schools,"This study was executed to enhance Music education at English Boys Schools. Solutions and recommendations to address specific problems are given.    The following aspects are dealt with: (1) The musical experience, involvement and milieu of the adolescent, secondary school English boy, (2) multi-cultural education and the different educational models, (3) the merits of Music education at English Boys Schools, (4) the problems surrounding the excessively high standards that exist in Instrumental music. The boys taking Music for two years only are divided from those who want to take it up till matric, (5) the adjustment that is made to aspects of Class Music due to the boys school milieu, (6) the value of integrating Music with other subjects, Life Skills and Arts Education, (7) appropriate extra curricular music activities for the boys school.    This study should supply the Music educators at English Boys Schools with relevant solutions to specific problems that occur at such schools.",0
Use of mnemonic strategies to facilitate written production of a second language by high school French students,"The purpose of the study is to determine whether four mnemonic strategies (gestural, musical, rhythmic, and acronyms) would facilitate various types of written production of French as a second language, as well as to differentiate mnemonic devices from mnemonic strategies, and place them both under the rubric of mnemonic systems. Mnemonic strategies, the focus of the study, are not found in current research literature. Unlike mnemonic devices which appear in extant research literature as memory aids, a mnemonic strategy is newly defined as a four part process, each part consisting of higher order thinking skills. This change in definition could help to expand perceived use of mnemonic systems beyond the sole function as an aid to memorization, moving mnemonic strategy use toward the broader definition currently given to metacognitive and cognitive strategies. To examine this definition, a carefully controlled experience was conducted in an actual classroom venue. A pretest/posttest control group research design was used. A sample population of 72 second year suburban high school French students were administered a pretest, classified by achievement level, matched, and then randomly assigned to a control or mnemonic-instructed group. After four and one-half weeks of instruction, participants were tested by means of a grammar test and essay task. Participants' perceptions of their use and the efficacy of the mnemonic strategies were obtained by means of two survey instruments; a questionnaire and an interview. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, repeated measures ANOVA, and step-wise multiple regression were used to analyze the results. Mnemonic-instructed participants significantly outperformed the control group in both types of language production. It was concluded that instruction in the four mnemonic strategies facilitates both grammatical and functional/communicative production of a second language for all achievement levels. Survey results suggest that, in general, participants perceive of themselves as users of the delineated mnemonic strategies and that the mnemonic strategies are seen to be effective. Results of the study are analyzed from a curricular perspective.",1
"The music of the Irumu people, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea","The author chose to pursue fieldwork among the Irumu people, in the Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea, because their culture is little known to the outside world. The residents of the seven villages inhabit the lower elevations of the Saruwaged Mountains, on the Huon Peninsula. Prior to the early 1980s, at which time a grass-surfaced airstrip was cut into the mountainside, the area was difficult to reach.    This dissertation, mainly descriptive, includes eight chapters. It begins with a preliminary discussion of the orthography for and phonology of the three languages spoken locally: Irumu, Kate, and Tok Pisin (in addition to English), Tok Pisin being the language in which the research was conducted. End-notes, a list of personal names and their meanings, selected texts and translations, and a bibliography are appended.    Chapter One presents a historical background to the culture, Chapter Two, a description of the geographical setting. Chapter Three describes traditional instruments and the music they play. The author posits a new theory for the function of wax pellets affixed to the head of hand-drums. He also argues that Irumu who play the Jew's harp do not mouth words, citing the example of a man playing while following a text in a hymnal. Chapter Four describes the singsing 'group song-dance', its history and contemporary performance style. The quiddity of each of eight types is sought. The process, which continues, is outlined. Chapter Five describes music in the three types of local primary schools: government, church, and Sunday School. Chapter Six discusses music performances in church, including that performed immediately prior to the service proper, to coax people to meet. A description of a full Christmas service rounds out the chapter. Chapter Seven describes popular music, emphasizing the tuning systems and performing techniques for two- and six-string guitars, and of large rafts of tuned percussion bamboo tubes. Additional, though minor points are appended.    Chapter Eight discusses a process which the author describes as ""the pidginization of music,"" briefly looks to the future, and adds closing thoughts.",0
Evolutionary perspectives on language: A twin study of adult foreign language learning ability,"In the first chapter, questions regarding the origins and evolution of language are discussed, along with methods for the investigation of such questions, including studies of fossils, archaeology, living primates, and modern human variation. In Chapter 2, primate communication studies, including laboratory and field studies of perception and call production are discussed; also discussed is the finding that primate (and other nonhuman) call perception is remarkably similar to human language sound perception. Ape language studies, as well as their possible relevance to origins of language and ""humanness"" are also discussed. In the third chapter, the heritability of language ability and disability is investigated, primarily through twin studies, and the conclusion reached that there is ample evidence for a genetic influence on variation in language ability, although this conclusion is based mainly on work with children. In chapter 4, first and second language acquisition are compared, and found to differ in many ways, but it is not clear whether they differ in some essential way or not. Critical periods for language learning are also discussed; it seems likely that different aspects of language learning occur with greatest facility at different times of life, with phonological skill declining first, well before puberty.    In the final chapters, the twin project is presented and discussed. The second language aptitude of 53 pairs of MZ and DZ twins was investigated using the MLAT (Modern Language Aptitude Test of Carroll and Sapon (1959)), a perception test (of discrimination of minimal contrast pairs), and a production test (of twins' abilities to produce the minimal contrasts). An overall trend toward higher MZ than DZ intraclass correlations was found, but this trend was of statistical significance for the production test alone. There was a negative correlation between age and MLAT3, MLAT5 and production test scores. A questionnaire given to the twins showed high correlations between test scores and such things as foreign language class grades, self assessments of language learning ability, spelling ability and grammatical ability, and musical training and ability. These results and their implications for variation in language ability and its heritability were discussed.",0
"A longitudinal study of literacy experiences, the role of parents, and children's literacy development","This study investigated the literacy experiences and attainment of 42 children aged 3 to 7, who had attended preschool education in a city in the North of England. Data were collected through parent interviews before nursery entry; literacy assessment at school entry, and at age seven; and by parent, teacher and child interviews. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were employed. Four measures of literacy development at age seven were used: children's reading book level, writing ability and standardised scores for reading and English at seven. Factors before school entry shown to be significant were: vocabulary scores, number of letters known, how well children wrote their name and a phrase, whether they listened to stories at nursery, and how often they were read to at home. This was influenced by earlier home factors; by having access to books, being read to from storybooks, and having books read in their entirety, the age parents started reading to them, how many nursery rhymes they knew, and parents pointing out environmental print. By seven, other significant factors were parents' knowledge about school literacy, and how often children read to parents at home. Several findings confirmed those of previous studies. Others were new: having a favourite book before nursery, choosing to read books in nursery, access to home computers at seven, children storing literacy resources indiscriminately, parents reading more than newspapers and magazines, and parents providing examples of day-to-day literacy. Process variables appeared to exert greater effects on children's performance than status variables, such as social class, mother's employment and qualifications, and relatives with literacy difficulties. Home literacy experiences for the majority of children were barely acknowledged in school, and home learning for children with problems was often unsupported by school. For most children, homes provided rich, complex and powerful environments for literacy learning.",0
Contemporary art song: An annotated bibliography of selected song literature appropriate for the undergraduate and master's level mezzo-soprano voice,"This annotated bibliography of contemporary art song literature is designed as a tool for voice teachers and vocal coaches working with undergraduate and master's level students. It is dedicated solely to the literature appropriate for mezzo-soprano, including all the appropriate subcategories: zwischen-fach, lyric, dramatic, and mezzo-contralto, and covers the years from 1940 through 1990.    Three primary criteria were used in determining whether song literature was appropriate for inclusion in this bibliography: (1) the appropriateness of particular song literature for undergraduate and master's level vocal study, (2) the usefulness of particular song literature for teaching technical and interpretive skills, and (3) the usefulness of particular song literature for recital performance and competition material for undergraduate and master's level voice students.    Entries are organized alphabetically by composer, listing the composer's name as well as dates and places of birth and death. Each entry contains the following information: text author, language, instrumentation, publisher, copyright date, order number, published keys, dedication, brief descriptive paragraph, level of difficulty, key, range, tessitura, meter, tempo marking, metronomic marking, dynamic requirements, length of song in measures, descriptive paragraphs regarding important aspects of the voice, piano and instrumental writing, special difficulties, uses for the song, and discography where appropriate.    The main body of the bibliography contains a listing of art song literature for voice and keyboard or voice and small instrumental ensemble. The text languages included are standard: English, French, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish. When songs by Western composers are in languages which are not within the chosen guidelines, they may be included in the Additional Material Appendix if other criteria have been met. Only songs with texts appropriate for the female singer have been chosen for inclusion. Only published song literature has been included here. Whether songs were in or out-of-print at the time of study was not a consideration.    Approximately 400 songs have been included in this bibliography.

"A survey of frequent first language aural texts among foreign language adult learners and educators, and selected texts for developing listening proficiency in two-year foreign language curricula","This study sought to identify (1) frequent aural texts in native language listening among adult foreign language learners and professionals and (2) aural texts for two-year college curricula seeking to develop listening proficiency.    The subjects were 540 students in five Virginia community colleges, and 129 national experts, state education agency personnel, and postsecondary methods teachers and community college instructors in Virginia.    The subjects responded to a survey using separate instruments developed for each group initially in a pilot study. The instruments included items measuring native language frequencies in interactive and transactional discourse, and attitudes about the inclusion of similar items in listening instruction.    Means and standard deviations measured native text frequencies for both groups. Most of the interactive texts, and radio/television broadcasts of news and weather, and songs (recorded/on the radio) were selected.    Pearson's Continuous Non-Parametric Chi Square and a practical statistical formula were performed evidencing significant differences (p $<$.05 or greater) of gender and age and listening frequencies for interactive and transactional types of discourse.    A one-way Analysis of Variance--ANOVA, and a practical statistical formula measured students and educators' attitudes about preferred aural texts for listening instruction. Both groups selected similar texts as those identified as native ones, in addition, to public announcement texts.    Significant differences for students' previous study and attitudes about instruction in listening/talking on the telephone existed, as well as, differences for educators' academic degree, experience, and knowledge about L2 listening/reading, and attitudes about selected texts for instruction. Differences were primarily evidenced for experience, and L2 listening/reading knowledge. Language instructors demonstrated fewer differences regarding similar backgrounds.    Age and gender consideration in text selection would be beneficial to adult learners. Instructors, primary sources of authentic input, could interact in all types of interactive discourse. Pre-recorded public announcements and news and weather broadcasts with bottom-up and bottom-down processing could accustom learners to ""normal"" speech. Songs, popular in native listening, could be beneficial for bottom-up processing and for lowering anxiety. The identified native texts and selected instructional texts would be helpful in developing listening curricula, materials, and assessment.",0
"Ghanaian pidgin English: In search of diachronic, synchronic, and sociolinguistic evidence","Considerable misinformation has been circulated about Ghanaian Pidgin English (GPE). Some Ghanaians attribute the worsening of standard English to the emergence of GPE. But GPE is serving a very important purpose which many critics overlook. It serves as an important medium of communication. It is used on a wide scale at many places, in popular songs, on political platforms, and on many occasions. It is used by both literate and illiterate people. Most importantly, pidgin English is becoming the lingua franca in English-speaking West Africa countries.    There has not been much formal attempt to study the pidgin English situation in Ghana, and because of this, some linguists do not believe that there is a pidgin in the country. In a personal letter to me, Professor Ian Hancock, a creolist at the University of Texas, expressed the need for a research on Ghanaian Pidgin English: ""It is heartening to learn that serious scholarly attention is being given to Pidgin in Ghana, the one West African nation for which least information is available on the local pidgin English."" The above observations, among other things, prompted me to do a research on the language so that it will open the way for other linguists to know that there is a pidgin in Ghana.    The study consists of six chapters which deal with the definitions and etymologies of pidgin and creole, the history of West African Pidgin English, the methodology of the research, history of GPE, a detailed linguistic analysis of GPE, the sociolinguistics of GPE, as well as conclusions on the survey.    Data were collected on GPE over a period of nine months. Out of the 400 copies of questionnaire distributed, 304 were retrieved. This period was also used in tape-recording interviews, conversations, and songs, as well as collecting magazines and newspapers. The informants, who consisted of both sexes, ranged from school children to a secretary of state.    The survey shows that there is a pidgin English in Ghana, and that it has been influenced by the substrate languages. It is spreading fast, especially among the youths, because it is being used not only as a means of communication but also as a means of solidarity.",0
Developing language through a musical program and its effect on the reading achievement of Spanish-speaking migrant children,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a language development program that uses music as a medium of instruction on the reading achievement of Spanish speaking migrant children. Fifty-one preschool aged subjects from a Title I (Michigan Department of Education, 1987) Summer Migrant Education Program participated in the study.    The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups. They were provided oral language instruction to help them acquire the language of the basal readers. In other words, the vocabulary and language patterns found in a basal reading program were built into the daily language lessons. In the comparison group, the subjects were instructed using a drill-type method; in the treatment group, the instruction was through musical activities. The musical activities were part of a specially designed program that used music to teach oral language. The musical program was developed by taking all the different words and language patterns found in the preprimers and arranging them into songs and set to music of familiar children's songs. The program ran for 6 weeks and the children participated twice daily.    At the end of the instructional period, the subjects were administered the Houghton Mifflin Reading Test (Brzeinski & Schoephoerster, 1983) which is designed to measure the level of reading mastery. The data were analyzed through the use of a t-test for independent means.    The findings of this study were inconclusive. The results of the t-test did not support a difference between the means of the post-test scores of the group receiving traditional drill-type instruction and the group receiving instruction through the medium of music. Even though a difference in the mean scores of the drill-type group and the musical group could not be substantiated, it is worthy to note that the children did not suffer academically by participating in the programs. In both groups the subjects made satisfactory progress in reading. The mean score of both groups was in the satisfactory range of accomplishment as set by the company.",1
"Computer use by teachers in the comprehensive high schools of the District of Columbia: Purpose, extent and factors affecting their use","This study was conducted to determine the status of computer use by teachers in the 14 comprehensive high schools of the District of Columbia, focusing on purposes, extent of use, and factors affecting use.    Data were collected from 174 teachers who were surveyed using a stratified sampling of disciplines: mathematics, English, social studies, science, foreign language, music and art. All computer laboratory coordinators (14) were surveyed. Twelve principals participated.    Survey results indicate that the main instructional purposes of computer use are drills to help students practice vocabulary or skills related to their specific subjects and word processing. Computers are used mainly for regular instruction (part of the regular delivery of instruction).    Other conclusions: teachers use computers very little; mathematics and English teachers are the most frequent users; one student works at a computer at a time; and most teachers use computers for instruction only one to two days out of every ten.    Factors contributing to computer use include a positive attitude toward computers on the part of teachers, coordinators, and principals; most teachers, coordinators, and principals have all been trained in computer literacy; status of a full-time coordinator assigned to each school; and teachers' perception of their own knowledge about computers.    Factors inhibiting computer use: too few computers, teachers' difficulty incorporating computers in the curriculum, and maintenance of hardware. Other inhibiting factors include too few printers, limited software for specific subject areas, lack of enough time for developing lessons that use computers, problems scheduling different teachers' classes, inadequate financial support from the school district, and high student/computer ratio.    Some recommendations: ongoing school-based training supplemental to district training, purchase of additional hardware, purchase of software specific to subjects, and word processing requirement for all high school students.",0
The music of primal peoples and its use in the elementary general music class,"This thesis provides elementary general music teachers with guidelines for adapting the music of non-literate, primal cultures for classroom use. It explores available resources for suitable song and dance activities and listening materials which can be used and enjoyed by English-speaking children of Western culture. Problems of maintaining a close approximation of aboriginal styles are discussed along with guidelines for authentic student performances. Lesson materials from a variety of cultures are provided for music teachers. Each lesson contains brief cultural background notes, guidelines for teaching and performing, and suggestions for substituting Orff instruments for native ones. Also included is a general outline of the nature and function of music in primal cultures and a critique of major music textbooks that contain examples of primal music.",0
Strategies for the remedial teaching of the Afrikaans-speaking primary school pupil with English spelling problems. (Afrikaans text);,"After a careful investigation of the ten to twelve year old child with (spelling) learning problems in the English second language spelling lesson, a remedial spelling teaching program is suggested. This program tries to incorporate: (1) the regularities and idiosyncrasies of an extensive English spelling vocabulary. The child is led to build a firm foundation of English spelling skills, and to discover common letter sequences (""letter-strings"") in English spelling; (2) the totality of needs and possibilities of the child. The creative abilities of every child are emphasized, and creativity is defined as a balanced interaction between the abilities of the right and left hemispheres of the brain (R- and L-Modes of perceiving and thinking). The program suggests how the child can be led to use his ""right brain-hemisphere abilities"" such as stories, humour, drama, illustrations and songs to create novel but meaningful contexts associating the words in each spelling family.",0
Metaphor and knowledge: Exploring the cognitive aspects of music through the development of a workbook for the study of notation in junior high school,"To assure music's proper place in the secondary curriculum, we must understand its role as a form of knowledge. With reference to such problem, the purpose of this study was threefold. First, it provided an epistemology using a modified developmental perspective and advancing the idea that knowledge is metaphoric. This perspective, eschewing Piagetian rationalism and idealism, focuses on knowledge as social and communicative. It regards as paramount the actual language used by persons making knowledge claims and also the intentions, motivations and beliefs informing such claims.    The notion of metaphor expands the idea of language's specificity in determining knowledge. It also identifies uniquely aesthetic functions; namely, the exploration of possible forms of symbolic organization without the concern for actuality and predictability marking science and ethics. It claims that aesthetic metaphors neither proceed from nor yield general principles, but do admit of specific reasoned judgments.    Second, it presented a vehicle for applying such epistemology in the form of a workbook for the study of notation in junior high school. The aim is to show that notation supplies the symbolic, cognitive center for musical studies just as the English language grounds approaches to English poetry. It is directed to junior high school students because they are developmentally best suited to it.    The workbook is meant for individual use, but its exploratory, open-ended tasks mandate strong teacher guidance and class interaction. Several specific metaphors accomplish its goals. Thus, Kodaly hand signals introduce notions of sound organization, the piano keyboard promotes understanding of tonal organization and mathematical fractions assist comprehension of note values. Students are also given opportunities to create their own metaphors through analysis and composition. Throughout, the rewards and aesthetic criteria remain intrinsic and bounded entirely by notation-based strategies.    The third purpose was to test the workbook in the classroom. To this end, it was used by two New York City public schools and evaluated by means of internal diagnostic and summative tests and teacher evaluation forms. This process revealed good student response and scores and high teacher approval. But some problems of teacher motivation and skills mark areas for future concern.",0
"""Dichterliebe"": An interpretive guide","The fact that song cycles are presumably unified works, rather than mere collections of songs, poses special performance problems. The singer and pianist must not only make evident the significance of the music and text of each song, but also the relationship of the songs that comprise the cycle to the whole work, as music and poetry. The song cycle Dichterliebe is, in this regard, chamber music, requiring a special level of cooperation, musical ability, artistry, and maturity from both performers. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the processes how such a work may be studied and its performance requirements established, taking into consideration the pertinent primary and secondary literature.    The roots of the song cycle are commonly associated with the nineteenth-century German Lied; it is Beethoven's cycle An die ferne Geliebte which is the first significant example.    Heinrich Heine, one of Germany's most important Romantic poets, greatly influenced the music of composers in the nineteenth century; there are over four thousand settings of his poems. The text of Dichterliebe is taken from Heine's Lyrisches Intermezzo, a collection of poems which Heine forced, with great skill, into an orderly sequence with a loose narrative and a succession of moods and thoughts. It is significant that Schumann selected and arranged the poems he used in order to arrive at a coherent entity. Dichterliebe represents a high point of Romantic Lieder; it unites the ultra-sensitive composer with the realistic, wary poet--introspection combined with wit.    A detailed analysis of the musical and poetic components and their realization was necessary for an understanding of their alliance. This is not to discount, however, the role of intuition in performance and obviously the need for capable and sensitive executants, but to state that knowledge and intuition, as well as the necessary technical equipment, are essential for a meaningful performance of Lieder. The study of Dichterliebe undertaken in this dissertation is concerned with its realization: the alliance of music and poetry, as Schumann has achieved it, and how it might be brought to life in concert.",0
"A psychological analysis and comparison of the white and black adolescent with regard to parent-child relationships, peer relationships, identity development and the formation of an occupational identity","Identity, occupational identity, parent-adolescent relationships, parental control and the importance of parents versus friends were investigated separately, cross-culturally and with regard to sex differences in Afrikaans and English speaking white adolescents and black adolescents (15-17 years) in the RSA. White and black adolescents' level of identity and occupational identity development showed no significant differences. However, English speaking white adolescents' level of identity development was lower than that of Afrikaans speaking adolescents. Sex differences did not occur. Closeness and understanding in the parent-adolescent relationship and democratic parental control promote identity development. Adolescents' experience of adolescence is related to their level of identity development. All the adolescents experienced adolescence as a difficult period.    Democratic parental control and a positive parent-adolescent relationship, characterised by communication, understanding and closeness occurred predominantly. In the case of black adolescents the relationship is characterised by a greater degree of estrangement and the parents are less democratic although the relationship is still positive. Black parents are regarded as authority figures to a larger extent than white parents. The extent of conflict in the parent-adolescent relationship does not effect the positive nature of the relationship. White adolescents agree with their parents on all matters except music preference. Black adolescents disagree with their parents on politics, sexual behaviour, heterosexual relationships and entertainment. Adolescents who do not discuss certain matters and problems with their parents attribute it to poor communication and estrangement. In all cultures the mother was found to be more understanding and to act more democratic than the father.    White parents predominantly approve of their adolescent childrens' friends and their advice and guidance. Black parents are less approving of their childrens' friends and disapprove of their advice and guidance. Adolescents in all three cultures indicate that the nature of the issue will determine with whom they will discuss issues. Parents' and friends' importance is therefore complementary although the advice and guidance of parents or adolescents' own opinion are valued more than that of friends.    The findings were considered in relation to the influence of Western values, sociocultural factors and adolescent developmental characteristics.",0
The role of music in the teaching of listening comprehension in Spanish,"The purpose of this study was to empirically compare two different methods of teaching listening comprehension to first-year students of Spanish. One method used songs as a listening text while the other method used narratives and dialogues.    The sample included 45 first-year high school Spanish students divided into two groups. One group (experimental) heard the listening text in the form of a song. The other group's (control) listening text was in the form of a short narrative or dialogue. The treatment consisted of five weeks of listening comprehension instruction in Spanish.    Both groups took weekly tests as well as a comprehensive exam at the end of the instructional period. In addition, two randomly selected first-year Spanish classes which had not received the treatment took the comprehensive exam. Comparisons were made via a series of one-way analysis of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).    Finally, students from both the experimental and control groups completed a questionnaire which assessed their subjective reactions to the materials and procedures employed in the study. Responses on the questionnaire were converted to numerical values through the use of a Likert scale and analyzed via a series of one-tailed t tests.    Results of the study were mixed. Generally, students from the experimental group performed better on the unit tests given at the conclusion of each week's lesson. There was no significant difference in the performance of control and experimental group students on the comprehensive test given at the end of the instructional period. Significant differences were found, however, between the performance of the two treatment groups and the two nontreatment groups. The treatment group scored significantly higher on the comprehensive test than did the nontreatment group. Finally, students from the control group generally had a more positive reaction to the materials and procedures used in the listening comprehension instruction. However, both groups found the instruction to be beneficial to their comprehension of spoken Spanish.",1
MEDIEVAL MUSIC AND CHILDREN,"The author examined the appropriateness of medieval music for inclusion in the music curriculum of children in the upper elementary school. Parallels were found between the development of music in the Middle Ages and the development of musical skills and awareness by children.    As background for the study, research was done in the political, social, and artistic areas of the period 1000-1400. Relationships were seen among these areas and with those of children's school curricula such as reading and social studies. A survey was then made of the vocal and instrumental music of the period: church and secular music, the development of notation, performance practices of the time, and instruments which were available.    Concepts and skills inherent in medieval music were compared to those concepts and skills present in existing music curricula. Examples of specific vocal and instrumental pieces are included which are suitable for performance by children with no musical background except in school. A comparison was made between medieval instruments and those available today for use by elementary children. Some attention was given to dances and poetry of the period which are appropriate for use in developing movement and creative skills in music.    The last chapter is a performing edition of the liturgical drama, The Son of Getron, from the thirteenth century Fleury Playbook. Based on Fletcher Collins' transcription of the liturgical drama, this edition is adapted for performance by nine to twelve-year-old children in school and in church. The adaptation includes the same characters and parts as does the original. Added parts include a narrator's spoken part and thirteen instrumental parts. The drama has been shortened considerably, and the literal English translation of the text by Collins adapted for performance by children. Suggestions are made for staging the drama with an emphasis on simplicity.",0
"MUSIC IN A NORTHERN ECUADORIAN HIGHLAND LOCUS: DIATONIC HARP, GENRES, HARPISTS, AND THEIR RITUAL JUNCTION IN THE QUECHUA CHILD'S WAKE. (VOLUMES I-III)","Based on the author's ethnomusicological field research in the zone, this dissertation first establishes the context in which area Quechua-speaking Indian harpists and singers live and work. The discussion focuses on pertinent aspects of local ethnography, such as walking, a theme with various metaphorical extensions in social behavior and in expressive culture.    The author then traces the introduction of the harp into the New World and investigates circumstances of the instrument's utilization through four hundred years of Latin American music cultural history. Finally, he delimits two major contemporary Ecuadorian diatonic harp traditions: the northern highland Quechua and the highland mestizo; the traditions contrast genres, performance styles and techniques, and harp dimensions and configurations.    In 1979-1980, the musical repertoire of Quechua harpists of the northern highland research site consisted of the three genres, sanjuan, pareja, and vacacion, each distinguished by certain musical, functional, and/or associational criteria. Transcriptions of sung Quechua texts, with parallel English translations, manifest sanjuan verse structures and, among other phenomena, formulaic expression--stressing certain principal verbs, notably purina, to walk. Thematic catalogues, illustrative musical transcriptions, and textual-musical analysis document the three genres.    Discussion of the musical styles, tunings and tuning processes, and performance practices of particular zonal Quechua harpists clarifies the tradition from the viewpoint of the individual artist; drawings, photographs, and measurements of harps owned and played by these musicians elucidate the physical aspects of area harps used at the time of research.    The festive child's wake is documented in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Hispanic South America for Quechua, Afro-American, and mestizoblanco cultures. Local northern Ecuadorian highland Quechua wawa velorio, or child's wake, in which the harpist plays a central role, is described from the author's personal observations of several of these rituals.    Appended historical linguistic data support a time depth of at least four hundred years for the Quechua language in northern highland Ecuador; modern linguistic material documents the mixture of Quechua and Spanish elements that characterizes local Quechuas' spoken and sung texts in 1980.",0
A CHRONOMETRIC STUDY OF SENTENCE PROCESSING IN DEAF CHILDREN,"It is known that deaf children's reading ability is far below that of normal hearing children. The present study investigate this reading problem from an information processing approach. Three experiments were conducted with profoundly deaf high school students. All subjects were singly handicapped deaf with hearing loss of 90 db and above in the better ear. The age of subjects ranged from 14 to 18 with a mean of 16.23. All scored 90 and above on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children(WISC).    The first experiment employed a letter-identification paradigm developed by Posner, Boies, Eichelman, and Taylor (1969). It was demonstrated that such a chronometric approach is useful in studying deaf subjects' letter decoding process. Deaf subjects took longer to encode alphabetic letters than hearing subjects. However, they took about the same time to decode the letters into an abstract code.    The second experiment investigated the coding strategy of deaf subjects in reading English sentences. A sentence-picture verification paradigm developed by Chase and Clark(1972) was used. In each trial, a sentence-picture pair was presented sequentially to the subject. The subject's task was to verify the truth of the picture with respect to the sentence. For example, if the sentence is either STAR IS ABOVE PLUS or PLUS IS NOT ABOVE STAR and the picture is +, the correct response is YES. These are the True Affirmative and True Negative sentences with respect to the picture. If the picture that follows either of the above sentences is *, then, the correct response is NO, since these are the False Affirmative and False Negative sentences with respect to the picture *. The sentence verification time required for the subject to respond to each of the four types of sentence-picture pairs was recorded. The results suggested that deaf subjects, unlike hearing subjects, did not use a general linguistic code to process English sentences. Instead, they use a visual-imagery code. These assertations are supported by (a) poor fit of the linguistic model to the data, (b) a very weak effect of syntactic structure, (c) a low negative time to falsification time (NT/FT) ratio, similar to that obtained with the picture-first paradigm, and (d) lack of a linguistic marking effect between ABOVE and BELOW sentences. Thus, it appeared that deaf subjects do not spontaneously use a linguistic code to process linguistic materials in this situation. The third experiment was designed to ascertain whether deaf subjects can use a linguistic code at all.    In this experiment, each sentence was signed word by word by an American Sign Language signer, rather than presented in the printed form. Otherwise the procedure was the same as in Experiment 2. The results suggested that the linguistic code is indeed available to deaf subjects, and that they use it to process signed sentence. This assertation is supported by (a) a close fit of a linguistic model to the data, (b) a very strong effect of sentence structure, (c) a NT/FT ratio of 3.314 which is very close to the 4:1 ratio predicted by the linguistic coding model, and (d) a significant linguistic marking effect between ABOVE and BELOW sentences.    The results of these experiments suggest that deaf subjects are capable of linguistic coding but do not spontaneously apply it when reading English sentences. It was suggested that they treat English reading as a problem solving task, adopting different strategies to solve the problem depending on the task demands. It may be that many of the inconsistent reports with respect to deaf subjects' reading strategies may be resolved by a task analysis approach.    Similarities between acquisition of printed English reading skills by the deaf and second language learning were discussed.",0
THE EDGAR WILLEMS APPROACH TO MUSIC EDUCATION,"This study presents a description of the Edgar Willems pedagogical system of music instruction developed in Switzerland. Willems' system is used mainly in Europe and Latin America. In the English-speaking world, this system is not as well-known as those of Orff and Kodaly. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to investigate the Willems approach and to make available to music educators in English-speaking countries, particularly in the United States, a description and analysis of it as a pedagogical system of music education.    Edgar Willems (1890-1978), was born in Belgium, but later became a citizen of Switzerland. He served as a professor at the Geneva Conservatory from 1927 to 1970. His approach to music education is based on three domains of life--physical, affective, and mental--and their relationship to three elements of music--rhythm, melody, and harmony.    The Willems approach makes use of songs chosen and composed for their pedagogical and artistic intent. Emphasis is placed on developing auditory perception by using specific sound-producing materials--primarily materials which aid students in acquiring a keen perception of intratonal spaces. The study of intratonal spaces is probably unique to the Willems approach. Among the intratonal materials perfected or invented by Willems are a series of small bells with pitch differences as small as one-thirtieth of a tone, the audiometer, and the sonometer with pitch differences as small as one tow-hundredths of a tone. Another instrument, the audicultor, was deveoped to permit individual ear training in intervals and triads.    Willems wrote approximately thirty books based upon his principles of music education. Of these, the two most important are Les bases psychologiques de l'education musicale and L'Oreille musicale which deals with sound, ear training, and sound-producing objects.    The primary institution offering education in the Willems method for children and adults is the Institut d'Education Musicale Edgar Willems located in Delemont, Switzerland. Jacques Chapuis, Willems' coworker, and institute trainees offer workshops for classroom and music teachers in France and Portugal. Teachers may earn certificates or diplomas after examinations in Switzerland, France, and Portugal where the system is widely used.    The procedure followed in the preparation of this study included:  (1) studying the principal published materials used in the system; (2) traveling, in 1978, to Switzerland, France, Portugal to interview disciples of Willems, teachers, pupils, and parents familiar with the method; (3) attending the Institut d'Education Musicale Edgar Willems; (4) attending the Congres International Willems--1978--Lyon, France. In addition the writer studied with Willems in Europe and applied the Willems approach in his native country of Brazil.    Biographical information about Willems, his philosophical and pedagogical ideas, insructional procedures for teachers, and information about the materials, instruments and tools used with the approach are presented in this study. Observations about the method and its effectiveness are based upon classroom visits and interviews with prominent Willems advocates. Applications of the Willems method in various countries throughout the world and persons who are the principal proponents of the method are also cited.",0
A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF THE MUSIC PROGRAMS IN ROBERTO CLEMENTE HIGH SCHOOL AND SELECTED FEEDER SCHOOLS AS THEY RELATE TO BILINGUAL-BICULTURAL EDUCATION,"The purpose of this study was to investigate and describe the music programs and their relationship to the bilingual-bicultural programs at Roberto Clemente High School and selected feeder elementary schools in the city of Chicago. The study was focused on administrative and curricular patterns as they relate to the music offerings for bilingual students in the schools. In addition, the investigator sought to determine the attitudes and opinions of administrators, music teachers, bilingual teachers, students and parents concerning the role of music in the education of bilingual students in the schools involved in the study.    After investigation of several high schools in the middle west having a large representation of Hispanic students, Roberto Clemente High School was selected as the locus for the study because it appeared to have exemplary programs of music education and bilingual-bicultural education. The investigative procedures included extended visitation and observation at the schools, formal and informal interviews with administrators, teachers, and students and the administration of questionnaires to students and parents. The resulting data were tabulated, recorded, analyzed and reported.    The following conclusions resulted from the study:  (1)Music plays an important role in the education of the students in the schools investigated and has gained impressive support from administrators, teachers and parents. (2)English speaking teachers have achieved effective rapport with students of limited English speaking ability and highly positive results in the music education programs. (3)A significant factor in the success of the music program at Roberto Clemente High School lies in the close relationship of the program content to the ethnic background of the students. (4)The Roberto Clemente High School Steel Drum Band has played an especially significant role in the education of bilingual students. (5)Participation in musical activities related to the ethnic background of students appears to contribute to the self-esteem and self-confidence of bilingual students at Roberto Clemente High School.

A guide for teachers in planning a language development program for the Puerto Rican child,"For children who speak little or no English, comprehension may be developed through such media as pictures, objects, models, dramatization and pantomime. Much practice is needed to fix associations with the words and sentence patterns developed through the use of materials.   The materials should be attractively arranged so as to invite initiative and stimulate conversation. The classroom environment should be such as to encourage children to use the English language.    Language development proceeds slowly and systematically and stems, in all cases, from varied experiences and activities that help in the child's adjustment and orientation to the school. Vocabulary should not be taken from a word list or from readers, but should be derived from a discussion of the experiences or activities in which the children have engaged. The new vocabulary must be presented and reinforced in many situations. Games, recreational activities, songs, records etc. help in this enforcement. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",0
"Music: An Instrument for Language and Literacy Development, The Art of Interdisciplinary Teaching: ELA and the Beatles for Grades K-3","Eisner (1980), Gardner (1993), and Dewey (1934) promote a holistic education, which greatly impacts the need for arts education in the classroom. Research substantiates that the arts play a critical role in literacy development (Hansen et al., 2014). This project addresses the integration of music as a method to reinforce language and literacy development. Students can engage in reading, writing, speaking, and listening while also studying various genres of music. Music enables students to grow into critical learners while exposing them to a world of language skills, literacy connections, and a spectrum of global cultures. When music is used among core subjects, specifically English Language Arts (ELA), it functions as a medium for further academic development. It awakens the learner’s interests. Popular culture is explored as a genre that encourages students to connect their background knowledge with language arts knowledge. In this project, the handbook supports multimodal approaches to help educate primary grade students. The Beatles music is incorporated in the elementary language arts curriculum while addressing the needs of Common Core State Standards. Specific standards are highlighted to validate the impact that music has on language development. Multimodality and interdisciplinary learning techniques are demonstrated while employing music as a tool to promote language and literacy development.",1
"Estudio Comparado De La Educación Musical En Los Sistemas Educativos Europeos De Alemania, Reino Unido, Países Bajos, Austria y España","La educación obligatoria de cada país debería desarrollar al máximo todas las capacidades de las nuevas generaciones. No obstante, en los últimos años, las tendencias internacionales apuntan que una «buena educación» es la que se centra, prioritariamente, en la adquisición de competencias que garanticen la empleabilidad. Asimismo, los sistemas educativos están reduciendo o eliminando las asignaturas de artes y humanidades. Al dejar fuera de la educación obligatoria estas asignaturas se incrementan las desigualdades sociales, puesto que son estas las que aportan una mayor cohesión a la sociedad. Además, si estas asignaturas se excluyen de la educación obligatoria, quedarán relegadas a aquellas familias que se las puedan permitir. En el contexto español, estas tendencias internacionales han tenido una gran repercusión. Así, por ejemplo, con el último cambio legislativo, la Educación Musical dejó de ser obligatoria. El principal objetivo de la presente tesis doctoral es el de comprobar si en otros países europeos, en los que la música tiene una gran presencia cultural, las tendencias internacionales han tenido un impacto tan elevado como en el caso español. El otro objetivo corresponde con recoger aquellos elementos de otros países que son interesantes para ser incorporados en España con el fin de mejorar la asignatura de Educación Musical. Para llevar a cabo los objetivos marcados en la presente tesis doctoral se ha elaborado un estudio comparado sobre la Educación Musical en los países de Alemania (Renania del Norte-Westfalia), Austria, Países Bajos, Reino Unido (Inglaterra) y España. Para ello, se han utilizado las diferentes legislaciones educativas, currículos y la formación inicial de los docentes para cada país y etapa. Además, también se han realizado consultas a entidades e investigadores expertos en la materia de cada uno de los países analizados. Las conclusiones del estudio nos muestran cómo la presencia de la Educación Musical, en los diferentes territorios europeos analizados, está más influenciada por el peso de la tradición musical de cada país que por las tendencias educativas internacionales. En este sentido, se ha comprobado que Alemania (NRW) y Austria son los países en los que más presente está la Educación Musical. Respecto al sistema educativo español, es imprescindible que la asignatura de Música vuelva a ser obligatoria, ya que es el único país que no la contempla. No obstante, cabe destacar que dentro del contexto español existen aspectos interesantes. Entre otros, podemos destacar que la distribución del currículo de música es similar al de Austria, y que respecto a la formación inicial del profesorado de educación primaria esta es semiespecialista, a diferencia de Austria, Inglaterra y los Países Bajos.Alternate abstract:Compulsory education in each country should develop all the abilities of new generations to their full extent. However, in recent years, international trends indicate that a «good education» is one that focuses,primarily, on the acquisition of skills that guarantee employability.In addition, education systems are reducing or eliminating arts and humanities subjects. Excluding these subjects from compulsory education increases social inequalities, as these are the subjects that bring greater cohesion to society. Furthermore, is these subjects are removed from compulsory education, they will be relegated to those families that can afford them. In the Spanish context, these international trends have had a great impact; for example, following the most recent legislative change,Music Education is no longer compulsory. The main objective of this doctoral thesis is to verify whether these tendencies have had as great an impact in other European countries (where music has a strong cultural presence), as they have had in Spain. The other objective is to gather interesting elements from other countries to incorporate into the Spanish education system, with the aim of improving the subject of Music Education. In order to fulfil the objectives set out in this doctoral thesis, a comparative study has been carried out on Music Education in Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia; NRW), Austria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (England) and Spain. For this purpose, the different education legislation, curricula and initial teacher training for each country and stage have been used. Moreover, consultations have also been carried out with entities and researchers who are experts in the field in each of the countries analysed. The conclusions of the study show that the availability of Music Education, in the different European countries analysed, is moreinfluenced by the weight of the musical tradition of each country than by international educational trends. Thus, it has been verified that Germany (NRW) and Austria are the countries in which Music Education is most widely available. With regard to the Spanish education system, it is essential that the subject of music is made compulsory again, as it is the only country which does not include it. However, it is important to highlight interesting aspects in the context of the Spanish education system, such as the distribution of the music curriculum which is similar to that of Austria, and the initial teacher training for primary education, which is semi-specialist, unlike Austria, England and the Netherlands.",0
"Murder, She Sang: A Progression on Sopranos and Death","Two recitals and an opera role were performed in lieu of a written dissertation.The following program notes and character analysis represent the summation of my creative, scholarly, and vocal accomplishments as a doctoral student at the University of Michigan.

"""Truly Qualified"": The Transnational Reception of Giovanni Rovetta's Music in Seventeenth-Century Europe","Early modern Venice flourished artistically and musically as one of the most cosmopolitan cities in all of Europe, and the Basilica of St. Mark’s represented the visual and musical power of La Serenissima. Giovanni Rovetta, who moved from choir boy in childhood to the basilica’s maestro in adulthood, understood St. Mark’s reputation not only in Venetian life, but also as a model for European composers and musicians. As music director at St. Mark’s, Rovetta contributed to Venice’s musical esteem, joining a lineage shared by composers such as Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), Cipriano de Rore (c. 1515–65), and Adrian Willaert (c. 1490–1562). However, despite his recognition and influence during his lifetime, musicologists have frequently neglected both his compositional role in sacred music and his innovative and virtuosic contributions to secular repertoire of the early Baroque. This thesis project underscores Rovetta’s musical role in promoting Venetian fame for residents of the Most Serene Republic as well as in foreign contexts ranging from France, Rome, German-speaking lands, and Restoration England. This study first bases Rovetta’s patronage and reception among Venetian supporters of music. Next, this project contextualizes and analyzes Rovetta’s music within Franco-Venetian diplomacy in 1639. Turning to a rival city-state, this study examines Rovetta’s noble patronage from a Roman duke who continued in the tradition of musical patronage initiated by his Medici ancestors. Considering Rovetta’s music in educational resources in Protestant German-speaking lands, this project investigates the role Rovetta’s music played in educating Lutheran students in late seventeenth-century Saxony. The study concludes with an analysis of Rovetta’s music included in the personal manuscript collection of one of Restoration England’s most revered composers, John Blow. In all of these contexts, Rovetta’s music serves as a sonic transnational representation of Venetian power and prestige, thereby illuminating this overlooked composer in seventeenth-century musicological discourse.",0
Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Breastfeeding Practices and the Impact of Interventions in a Low-Income Population in Los Angeles County,"Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ‘interventions’ for reducing infant mortality. Despite ongoing efforts to promote breastfeeding, current breastfeeding rates in the U.S. are still low, and socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding practices have persisted. Improving breastfeeding practices among socially disadvantaged groups remains challenging.The goal of this dissertation is to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding practices in the United States. Specifically, this dissertation aims to: (1) assess the influences of breastfeeding support from family, hospitals and workplaces on breastfeeding duration; (2) determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding duration could be explained by breastfeeding support; and (3) estimate the population impact of multifaceted breastfeeding promotion interventions.Using data on approximately 4,000 mothers enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), from the triennial Los Angeles County WIC Survey (2014, 2017), this dissertation found that breastfeeding support from family, hospitals and workplaces was significantly associated with longer breastfeeding duration, and that Black mothers and English-speaking Latina mothers have significantly lower breastfeeding rates than White mothers, with the difference widening over increasing duration. Results from causal mediation analysis (specifically, g-computation) showed that lack of access to breastfeeding support from family, hospitals and workplaces accounted for approximately two-thirds of the difference in breastfeeding duration between White and Black mothers, and one-third of the difference between White and English-speaking Latina mothers. This dissertation also illustrated the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) for estimating the population impact of five selected breastfeeding promotion interventions (improving knowledge, implementing Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative practices, providing breastfeeding counseling, strengthening family support, and fostering supportive workplace environments) implemented singly or in combination with each other. The ABM demonstrated that while improving knowledge and increasing the availability of Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative practices improve breastfeeding initiation rates, breastfeeding counseling, family support and a supportive workplace environment are more effective in improving breastfeeding duration. Increasing the coverage of multiple interventions simultaneously had a synergistic effect on breastfeeding duration, with their effects being greater than the additive effects of increasing the coverage of these interventions singly.",0
Dancing to Learn Navajo: Assessing Levels of Perceived Learning Enjoyment in Young Dual-Language Navajo Students following a Short Session of Aerobic Dance,"To improve both motivation and positive learning of the Navajo language for young Navajo children who are primarily English speaking, I introduced a dose of dancing before a typical Navajo language class for elementary students. The goal for the 15 minutes of dance was to create a sense of enjoyment that would carry over into the course, and the results were that students engaged. This study shows that traditional Navajo holistic education orientation that incorporates music; independent, free-flow dance; and exercise of the body prior to a language lesson can enhance learning outcomes. Although the experiment had a small number of participants, the positive results, coupled with my own experiences as revealed via autoethnographic interpretations, offer new directions for creative instruction on behalf of saving the Navajo language.",0
"Male Hysteria, Degenerate Opera: Post-Wagnerian Music Drama in the Era of World War I","This dissertation interrogates ideas about gender and Austro-German identity in the years before, during, and after World War I, offering historically informed hermeneutic readings of Berg’s Wozzeck, Schreker’s Die Gezeichneten, and Korngold’s Die tote Stadt. Specifically, by drawing on concepts from critical disability and masculinity studies, this research considers how the operas under investigation — each of which features a seemingly emasculated protagonist and music that resists the traditional (masculinist) confines of modernism — were in dialogue with broader socio-political and aesthetic anxieties about being a man during the war years.This project centres on issues of vocality, departing from the kinds of formal-motivic analysis that have prevailed in previous studies of twentieth-century Austro-German opera. Such emphasis on voice allows Chapter 1 to raise questions about what sounded “natural,” therefore healthy and virile in the German nation, as it interrogates the musical-linguistic expressions in Berg’s Wozzeck. A further research focus is to explore aspects of the operas that seem tangential but in fact featured prominently in historical performance reviews. Chapter 2 thus examines the moralistic stance of Die Gezeichneten’s numerous but hitherto overlooked secondary characters, contextualizing that stance in light of the fin-de-siècle press’s tendency to sensationalism and arguing that provocative vocabularies of “degeneracy” occupied a positively celebratory place in Schreker’s pre-Nazi reception. Finally, Chapter 3 turns its attention to the figure of an ostensibly lone Jewish man to probe questions of “Jewish difference” and Die tote Stadt’s rarely discussed commedia dell’arte sequence of Act II. Placing side by side Wagnerian symbolism and commedia dell’arte — that is, ingredients from Christianity and contemporary popular Jewish theatre — Korngold’s opera asked timely questions of Jewish manhood and citizenry in Austria’s First Republic.This dissertation’s interrogation of masculinity adds to opera studies’ long-standing investment in representations of gender. It further contributes to musicology’s burgeoning engagement with disability aesthetics, as its historically oriented work asks how the operas studied herein underscore post-/WWI politics of injury, rather than seeking in the music symptoms of illness. These wartime works ultimately offer audio-visual experiences that challenge Austro-German nationalist ideals — and authoritarian aesthetics — of the first decades of the twentieth century.",0
"Blossoming Multiliteracies: Stories of How W̱SÁNEĆ, Quw’Utsun, Gitga’At, and Líl̓wat Nations Reclaim Indigenous Languages and Food Systems Through Pedagogies of the Land","Indigenous languages are windows into a myriad of worldviews (Simpson, 2011). They are repositories of botanical, environmental, and kinship knowledges, and, perhaps more importantly, are central to Indigenous identity (McCarty et al., 2018). As W̱SÁNEĆ, Quw’utsun, Líl̓wat and Gitga’at communities (re)inhabit social, physical, spiritual, and emotional spaces to speak their languages of SENĆOŦEN, Hul’q’umi’num’, Ucwalmícwts, and Sm̓algya̱x, respectively, they use pedagogies of the land. Teaching styles are grounded in Indigenous land education (Calderon, 2014; Goodyear-Ka‘ōpua, 2013) and decolonizing botanical knowledges (Geniusz, 2009) as (w)holistic curricula, upholding ontologies of lands and waters.     As a settler researcher on these lands, I engaged in conversations with nine Elders and educators from Coast Salish (SȾÁUTW̱, W̱JOȽEȽP, W̱SÍKEM, Quw’utsun), Gitga’at, and Líl̓wat First Nations, and two settlers. Research questions inquired into how youth and Elders approach language reclamation. I learned pedagogies of the land are a return to ancestral ways of being, counter-hegemonic actions that pull children and adults towards nature-based spaces, nurturing whole beings. Conceptual frameworks integrate anti-colonial (Carlson, 2016), Indigenous-centred methodologies (Smith, 2012). Conscious of “unsettling” (Regan, 2010) my positionality as active witness (Atkinson, 2001), I gathered knowledges through conversational interviews (Kovach, 2010) and storywork (Anderson, 2011; Archibald, 2008), contributing through eco-cultural restoration.     Knowledge Keepers shared stories of teaching on the land, drawn to sacred places through keystone food systems, interweaving Oral Histories with Indigenous languages. Stories are linked thematically through an iterative framework, and shed light into how Indigenous languages are transmitted intergenerationally, grounded in local epistemologies. Findings show how first (L1) and second (L2) language acquisition connects with ethnobotanical knowledges; blending mariculture, prayer names, traditional practices, and songs. Foods and medicines are harvested in reciprocal acts of gratitude. Through this work, multiple layered literacies develop, with students learning and speaking Indigenous languages through (w)holistic, land-centred education (heart- and community-literacies), while regenerating lands, waters, and medicines (food- and ecological-literacies). Languages grow as part of linguistic ecologies (Twitchell, 2017), thriving within the seen and unseen, more than human world. This thesis may interest those in the fields of language revitalization; food sovereignty, security, and native plants; language policy; eco-justice; and land-based Indigenous pedagogies.",0
Teacher Confidence to Facilitate Children's Musical Learning and Development in the Reception Year at School,"The Reception year occupies a unique position in the English education continua, straddling two contrasting curricula approaches towards teaching and learning. This study sought to address the lack of research into music pedagogy and practice for this particular cohort. Responding to concerns of a reported decreasing visibility of music in the curriculum, this thesis explored teacher confidence in respect of musical learning and development of the children in the Reception class. Grounded in a circular theoretical framework, developed from the principles of hermeneutic philosophy, this small-scale mixed methods study adopted an explanatory sequential research design. Thus, questionnaire survey data served to provide a broad contextual frame in which to situate a more in-depth study proffered by participant interviews. A quasi-purposive sampling of a particular population of Reception teachers in the East of England provided the questionnaire respondents (n=39), whilst the interview participants (n=8) emerged as a `nested` subset in this mixed methods study. Findings evidence that some teachers are struggling to incorporate regular opportunities for music teaching and learning in the Reception curricula, due to: (1) internal as well as external constraints and challenges; (2) a bias toward the functional uses of music for extrinsic purposes - such as a vehicle to scaffold other learning - rather than for any intrinsic value; (3) a disconnect between strong personal and comparatively weak professional musical identities as expressed by most of the participants; (4) a reported lack of teacher confidence to develop children's musical learning within the EYFS framework due to poor levels of skills, knowledge and understanding with regard to musical pedagogical practices. These findings emerge at an opportune time to help inform policy and practice, as research in early childhood music education becomes more prevalent, further to the recent changes to the Ofsted framework (2019), as well as the forthcoming publication of the revised National Plan for Music Education (2020).",0
"Beyond Prima Donna: Pauline Viardot’s Collaboration on Meyerbeer’s <em>Le Prophète</em>, Gounod’s <em>Sapho</em>, and Berlioz’s Arrangement of <em>Orphée</em>","Prima donnas of the nineteenth century enjoyed celebrity status and were the wealthiest women of their time. Mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot’s (1821–1910) diva status provided her with a platform from which to share the full extent of her musical abilities. Viardot’s capabilities as a performer are widely acknowledged and reviewed throughout history; however, her contributions to French music beyond simply singing are only beginning to be understood. Her Thursday night salon promoted the music of both established and unknown composers, and hosted important guests, including Alfred de Musset, George Sand, Charles Dickens, Charles Gounod, Frédéric Chopin, and Franz Liszt. Viardot’s musical talents were respected and utilized in the premieres of Giacomo Meyerbeer’s Le prophète (1849), Charles Gounod’s Sapho (1851), and Hector Berlioz’s revision of Gluck’s Orphée (1859). Through her salon and collaboration with composers, Viardot shaped the careers of others, contributing in a broader sense to the trajectory of French music of the nineteenth century.This thesis uses manuscript scores, musical analyses of the operas, letters, and other primary source documents to argue that Viardot was an essential collaborator in her relationships with Meyerbeer, Gounod, and Berlioz, and that she was integral to their various successes as opera composers. Chapter One surveys the relevant literature used for researching this thesis. Chapter Two provides a biographical sketch of Viardot which contextualizes how she learned collaboration from her family, and then used her salon as a way to implement this skill through the promotion of young composers. Chapters Three, Four, and Five turn to an analyses of her roles in Le prophète (Fidès), Sapho (Sapho), and Orphée (Orphée) in order to establish her relationship to the composers, how plot adaptations were devised to highlight her acting abilities, and how musical adaptations featured her vocal talents. These chapters will show how Viardot played a role in the musical alterations of these works. Through this analysis, this thesis highlights Viardot’s contributions to the careers of these men and ultimately the musical life of nineteenth-century France.",0
Large Group Video Modeling: Increasing Social Interactions in an Inclusive Head Start Classroom,"Social skills are associated positive academic and well-being outcomes across the lifespan, especially for individuals with disabiliites (Carter, Sisco, Chung, & Stanton-Chapman, 2010; Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, Berk, & Singer, 2009; Lifter, Mason, & Barton, 2011; Rubin, Bukowski, & Laursen, 2009). Without instruction, children with disabilities often have social skill delays that result in social isolation and peer rejection (Barton, 2015; Goldstein, English, Shafer, & Kaczmarek, 1997; Gresham, 1982; Nelson, McDonnell, Johnson, Crompton, & Nelson, 2007; Rogers, 2000; Travis, Sigman, & Ruskin, 2001). Direct and explicit instruction, not only for the targeted child but also for their peers, is required to support the acquisition and generalization of positive social interactions.     The purpose of this study was to answer three research questions. The first research question examined the effects of a large group video modeling intervention at increasing positive social interactions, both initiations and responses, of young children with disabilities and their peers. The second questioned examined if the effects of the intervention generalized to another setting, the outdoor playground. The third question examined teachers reported satisfaction with the acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention as measured by the Behavioral Intervention Rating Scale (BIRS, Elliot & Von Brock Treuting, 1991).     A multiple baseline design across participants was used to examine whether a functional relationship existed between a large group video modeling intervention and increased social interactions and if the skills generalized to the outdoor playground. Visual and statistical analysis were used in addition to Tau to examine effect size. Additional analysis was conducted to determine whether a functional relationship existed between the intervention and an increase in social initiations (motor and verbal) by participants. Social validity was collected from teachers and teacher assistants who implemented the interventions.     Four preschool age children with developmental delays and their classroom peers participated in the study. Results of the study suggest a functional relationship between the large group video modeling intervention and an increase in the number of intervals participants engaged in positive social interactions with peers for all participants. Data suggests a functional relationship between the classroom intervention and an increase in social interactions in the generalization setting for all participants, but to a lesser degree than post intervention. Teachers reported they were satisfied with the intervention effects, the targeted skills were important, the intervention was easily implemented with a high degree of fidelity, and the intervention lead to an increase is social interactions.",0
Isaac's World,"Isaac’s World is an electronic piece featuring audio samples of my son, Isaac, a three-year old, Brazilian and American citizen who speaks both Portuguese and English.Through this composition, I attempted to capture and musically evoke a child’s sense of personal experience, growth, and development, using Isaac’s diverse vocal sounds, including English and Portuguese words spoken by Isaac. The title of the composition, Isaac’s World, is a result of my endeavor to artistically illustrate not only Isaac’s experience thus far as a curious toddler, but also the new world awaiting future generations of our family, descendants of Isaac, the first American-born child of our lineage.",0
Identifying Strategies to Support the Communication of Prelinguistic Bilinguals with Severe Disabilities,"The prevalence of children with severe and multiple disabilities who come from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds increased considerably with the rise of immigration to the U.S. However, there is very little research about the way that children with disabilities who come from a culturally and linguistically diverse background communicate and develop communication skills (Mueller, Singer, & Carranza, 2006). Furthermore, there is no established term for describing this group of children. That is why this study uses the term Prelinguistic bilinguals to define individuals who use one or more languages at a nonverbal level in their everyday lives. This definition of prelinguistic bilinguals was built upon Grosjean’s (2010) definition of bilingualism. Knowing how prelinguistic bilingual children communicate and develop communication skills is fundamental for their educational team in order to effectively interact and support the children’s communication, which in turn would have a positive effect on their learning outcomes.    The main goals of this study were to describe the communication of prelinguistic bilingual children and to learn more about what teachers, teacher assistants, speech language pathologists, and parents do to support their communication in English and Spanish. This qualitative study uses a constructivist theory approach to make in-case and across-case analyses of three case studies. Findings for the study indicated that prelinguistic bilingual children were not only aware of a difference between the two languages, but could also express a preference for one of their languages. Most of the communication supports that the participating adults provided for prelinguistic bilingual children were the same communication supports used for monolingual children developing language, which did not consider the children’s bilingual needs.",0
The Language and Culture of Costume Design,"When we think of language and culture, we often think of our ethnical background, along with the influences from our society, history, media and the people around us. However, through my years here at UCSD, I have learned that there is a different form of language and culture in Costume Design.     Culture impacts how we think and language helps us communicate; both play a major part in us understanding one another. For each show that I worked on, I’ve had to learn a new language to speak to directors, actors, and costume technicians. The language that I am speaking of is not English, French, or Vietnamese but rather it pertains to the choice of words I use to communicate my design. For culture, as a costume designer, we are always balancing between pop culture and historical culture.     Kyle Donnelly’s adaptation of Taming of the Shrew(d), the play was set in a post-apocalyptic world where a group of women put of plays in exchange for food and water. Donnelly was highly influenced by her environment when she pitched this idea – requests in the department, politics, and the movie, Mad Max: Fury Road, which was very popular at the time. For the development of my design, I researched pop culture’s different ideas of post-apocalyptic worlds as well as the history of American stereotypes in women’s clothing and how it relates to their job (i.e. the waitress, the businesswoman, the stay-at-home mom).     In my pop culture research (film & television, modern art, comics, etc.), depictions of post-apocalypse worlds are often characterized by distressed clothing, dirt, make-shift weapons and recycling, which I used in my overall design. For each individual character’s look, historical culture was a major influence – the cut of a business suit jacket, the recognizable color and shape of a waitress uniform. Knowing both pop and historical culture helped me develop the language I needed to clearly convey my ideas.    To gain both the director’s and actors’ confidence, I had to educate myself and used terms they would understand by referencing things they are exposed to in their daily lives – film, art, music. I also focused on character development – the backstory, the mental and physical state, education and more. For example, Hannah Finn’s character story was that before the apocalypse, she was a high school dropout working as a waitress at a diner in a small town. She was poor, uneducated but funny and loves to make jokes. She was at work when the apocalypse took place, which explains why she’s still in her work uniform. Her character also wears a chest armor made from cans and uses a large ladle that has nails through it as a weapon (to mimic a mace), which was inspired by things she would have found in the diner kitchen. Both the director and the actor loved the visual and emotional story created for the character and understood the concept that I was going for.     When presenting to the costume shop, I introduced the general post-apocalyptic theme, however, instead of talking about each character’s backstory, we spoke about construction, fit and function of each outfit. The language use when speaking to the shop is much more technical. I had to learn clothing and construction terminology – such as raglan sleeve, a gather, a blind stitch, etc. – to properly articulate my design. Using Finn’s costume as an example again, with the technicians, we talked about the history of the style of the uniform and how it should fit, where wear and tear should be, how distressed it should look and how the can apron should be constructed to look like it was home-made. Costume vocabulary and details are very important when it comes to the construction. I was very specific when providing Finn’s actions in the play and the technicians offered solutions to some clothing restrictions she was experiencing, such as adding a gusset to the underarm area of the sleeve to give her more room to stretch her arms up. Without knowing the proper language, we would have had a harder time understanding the needs of the show...",0
El teatro de Rafael Álvarez <i>El Brujo</i>: Una visión del Siglo de Oro entre la creación personal y las tendencias escénicas de la palabra,"This dissertation examines the theater of Spanish actor, director and author Rafael Álvarez El Brujo through the analysis of three of his major monologues. El Brujo constitutes a rather unique case in Spanish theater following the emergence of the  teatro di narrazione italiano in the 1980’s. His work emphasizes the oral quality of Golden Age texts and provides an original insight on this period. Furthermore, the study of these plays within the context in which they were premiered reveals key aspects about the Spanish cultural scene during the past twenty five years, from the encouragement of Golden Age-related productions to the importance of commemorations and events such as the Festival de Almagro.    The first chapter focuses on his iconic play Lazarillo de Tormes  (1990), which initiates his lasting and complicated relationship with institutional theater. By comparing the first and last representations, we can identify the strategies that El Brujo uses to create humor, primarily through his rich gestural work, and trace the evolution of his theater as he becomes a storyteller or performer in the style of Italian actor Dario Fo. The second chapter is dedicated to Los misterios del Quijote (2005), which El Brujo creates in collaboration with Emilio Pascual. This play coincides with the growth of the musical and the comic monologues crafted after the TV show El Club de la Comedia . In the process of distancing himself from these products,  El Brujo masters the introduction of autobiographical episodes and dedicates this monologue to the spoken word, leaning toward other theater-related alternatives which have acquired popularity since the beginning of the democratic period. In the third and last chapter, we take Teresa o el sol por dentro (2015) as an example of the actor’s work with the mystics.  El Brujo proposes a multidisciplinary approach to Saint Teresa of Ávila, which starts with a long prologue and continues with a detailed account of her childhood and adolescence. By alternating episodes of the Saint’s life with the recitation of some of her poems, the actor prioritizes her work as a writer and addresses the manipulations around this figure which spread from the 17th-century till the end of Franco’s dictatorship.    Since premiering Lazarillo de Tormes,  El Brujo has actively contributed to the circulation and dissemination of the classics in post-Franco Spain along with the Compañía Nacional de Teatro Clásico, created in 1986, and other private theater companies. Nevertheless, the actor attracts all kinds of spectators as he creates very personal versions of canonical texts, establishing connections with contemporary issues and adding comments in a pedagogical tone. Moreover, his work on a relatively empty stage has become one of the main characteristics of his theater as well as a sign of his flexible attitude toward the classics. Through focusing on his videos and live performances, we cultivate an alternative approach to studying theater and the actor’s art.",0
"Origin and Antitype: Medievalism in Nineteenth-Century Germany, 1806-1914","This dissertation examines how the nineteenth-century engagement with medieval Europe changed modern Germany. Drawing from archival and printed primary material, I reconstruct how the Middle Ages gained new explanatory relevance as the origins of nineteenth-century German institutions and phenomena. I consider the historical interpretation of the medieval world at its broadest, not limited to scholarly debate, but also as it encompassed fiction, art, architecture, music, social science, law, and politics. Each chapter examines a figure drawn from these fields and each also moves chronologically through the century. I begin with the historian and statesman Barthold Niebuhr, who invoked the German Middle Ages as a source of patriotism and as an alternative to the Roman legal tradition. I next discuss the politician and architectural theorist August Reichensperger, who used the perceived regionalism of the medieval past as a means to resist Prussian centralization. My third chapter focuses on the intersection of historical research and fiction in the work of Victor von Scheffel, before I then turn to the role of the Medieval in Richard Wagner’s Ring cycle. The final chapter of my dissertation treats how assumptions about the medieval world affected the frameworks that early sociologists used.    I argue that nineteenth-century conceptions and uses of the Middle Ages retained mythical or profoundly transhistorical elements, even as historians and philologists made the period more historically legible. Furthermore, the protagonists of my dissertation read nineteenth-century categories and concerns onto the Middle Ages. Their agendas shaped perceptions of the past, and, more importantly, influenced the structures and norms of the nineteenth century. These five figures fundamentally believed, however, that their distortions accurately depicted the historical record. I attend to this belief, that their portrayals of the past were true, rather than purely opportunistic bids to shape the present. I conclude by exploring how only in the mid twentieth century did medieval historians—specifically, Ernst Kantorowicz—begin to examine the influence of nineteenth-century vocabularies and frameworks on the formation of their field.",0
Theater education: Thinking outside of the black box,"A 2005 report by the Rand Corporation concluded that ""Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking, and verbal skill"" (Smith). A 2012 report from the National Endowment for the Arts mirrored these findings, stating that “Students who have arts-rich experiences in school do better across-the-board academically, they also become more active and engaged citizens, voting, volunteering, and generally participating at higher rates than their peers” (Garelick 1). The above statements speak to the mounting evidence that arts in education provide extensive benefits for students fortunate enough to have them as part of their curriculum. Yet over the years, arts education continues to be cut from public school curriculums at an alarming rate. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how best to eradicate this issue, through the utilization of Hybrid classes. The solution outlined in this thesis requires the merging of state-mandated courses, such as English, math or science, with a specific aspect of arts education, such as art, music or theater arts; these “Hybrid” classes represent the future of education. Utilizing existing staff and faculty, this proposed plan is cost-effective, and could serve to cut the student-teacher ratio in half. This aforementioned concept will allow teachers of varying disciplines to unite, and offers students a well-rounded education that will fully prepare them for post-secondary education. The goal of this thesis is lofty and the concept extensive, therefore I have opted to limit the scope to that of a theater arts and English model, within the middle and junior high schools grades (6-8) within the Clark County public school system in Las Vegas, Nevada.",0
A Collaborative Inquiry into Preserving and Transmitting Our Mexican Heritage,"As our final requirement for a Master’s Degree in Leadership at Saint Mary's College of California we convened a Collaborative Inquiry (CI) project with four other co-participants from our family to explore ways to celebrate, preserve, and pass on Mexican culture while living in the United States.  For ten weeks we met weekly to share the aspects of Mexican culture important to each of us, and the ways we were already engaging in them and transmitting them to our children—including stories, food, holiday celebrations, music, Spanish communication, religious practices and values. Intentions for follow up include: being in touch with relatives in Mexico; continuing to celebrate Mexican holidays; speaking Spanish when possible; encouraging others to join in the identification and celebration of meaningful cultural practices through a continuing CI. The conveners facilitated authentic collaboration with all six co-participants as they introduced CI methodology and consolidated their own leadership practices.",0
Lear,"This opera, Lear, draws its libretto directly from William Shakespeare's King Lear. Some supporting characters and subplots have been removed, and some characters have been fused to reduce the time and forces needed to produce this piece.    Parent/child relationships, eyesight, and deception/disguises are important themes in this adapted libretto. The last point, deception and disguises, receives special attention in the opera. Each time a character dons a disguise a ""transformation"" motive is heard. Simultaneously, at least one of the woodwind players will switch to a traditional doubling instrument to add a timbral change to the visual change on the stage.    Two characters in the opera never sing, but only speak: Lear and Gloucester. This separates them from the rest of the cast to highlight their paternal nature. The music for spoken sections includes liberal use of fermatas, vamps, and other forms of repetition to underscore the speech.    Most characters have musical motives and/or signature styles to aid in their characterization. Goneril and Edmund are intelligent, eloquent, and manipulative. heir music can be triadic and diatonic when they need it to be, and their lines are often winding and chromatic. Regan and Oswald, on the other hand, are more characters of action than thought. Their music is more blunt and to the point.    The harmony of the opera moves among diatonic, quartal, whole-tone, octatonic, hexatonic, and more complicated harmonies, depending on the character singing or speaking and what his motives are at that moment. At several points in the opera, a rhythmic pattern will continue over a bar that obscures the meter. Sometimes multiple patterns will be present at once. The harmony is at its most complicated when these patterns overlap, or when two characters' personal motives are presented simultaneously.    The opera's duration is approximately two hours. The cast calls for two sopranos, two mezzo-sopranos, two baritones, a bass-baritone, and two male actors. The opera is scored for Flute (doubling Piccolo and Alto Flute), Oboe (doubling English Horn), Bb Clarinet (doubling Bass Clarinet), Bassoon, Horn in F, Percussion (one player), Piano, String Quartet, and Double Bass.",0
Korean English teachers' perceptions about teaching and assessing multimodal composition: A new direction for writing instruction and assessment in the 21<sup>st</sup> century,"Literacy in the 21st century is not confined to communication based on reading and writing only print texts. New literacies include multimedia projects and multimodal texts, which include visual, audio, and technological elements to produce all types of products. The writing classroom, in particular, should reflect these social and technological changes in communication. It is critical for writing teachers to understand that literacies are historically, socially, culturally, and developmentally situated and to adapt as they change. By teaching multimodal composition, they may help students learn about effective writing that can appeal to various audiences and serve specific practical purposes and specific real-world contexts.      The theoretical background of the study is a social semiotic theory that concerns how people communicate using semiotic resources in a particular setting. The semiotic resources, which are actions, artifacts, and materials, are not fixed but are transformed by the sign-makers' choices. Aligned with this social semiotic theory, multimodal composition draws on diverse semiotic resources such as image, music, actions, and so forth. The use of these resources is always influenced not only by personal interests but also by interpersonal and institutional power relations. Teaching multimodal composition is a response to needs in an age of digital communication and to changing semiotic environments.     The purpose of the dissertation is to determine how Korean secondary English teachers understand and assess multimodal composition in the era of new communication. Framing the study are questions that ask teachers what they think and say about teaching and assessing multimodal compostion in their writing classrooms, and about barriers or challenges to their doing so.  Korean secondary English teachers working for public schools in metropolitan areas were recruited for this multiple case study to examine their attitudes toward and understanding of multimodal composition in the test-oriented culture of Korea. Semi-structured interviews and classroom observations were conducted, and documents were collected to triangulate interview findings.      South Korea is chosen as the research site because schools most prioritize high-stakes standardized tests, and teachers (also students and parents) gauge success by test scores. As a result, teachers primarily rely on direct instructions via lecture to provide skills and knowledge to ensure that students will succeed in the high-stakes tests. However, ongoing technology outside of school has transformed ways young people generate, communicate, and negotiate meanings via diverse texts. If the primary goal of education is to teach students life-long skills needed in society, it is a responsibility that the schools and teachers recognize social changes and promote individual learning needs. Therefore, this study explores teaching and assessing practices in the context of Korean English classrooms and suggests a new direction reflecting social changes and changing student needs for the era of new communications.",0
Une Exploration De La Morphologie Du Conte Africain Francophone,"The aim of this study is the examination of the suitability, for application to the French-African folktale, of the models of form and structure proposed by Bremond, Greimas, Paulme, Propp and Scheub. Such a study requires a certain preparation, and particularly the consideration of the folktale as genre, as well as the nature of the Franco-African folktale in particular.Five problems arose. The first problem the researcher must overcome, is the selection of a valid corpus of folktales. Closely associated with this is the difficulty of finding texts in translation that are representative of the form and nature of the Franco-African folktale. The use of translated texts is inevitable. The aeries compiled by the Conseil International de la Lanque Francaise (C.I.L.F.), proved invaluable because care was taken by the editors with the problem of authenticity. Another reliable source of recorded folktales is that of African writers such as B.B. Dadié, B. Diop and O. Socé, who write directly in French. Tales analysed here were drawn from both these categories. The differences between texts from these two sources-are also highlighted in a comparison of a folktale by Dadie and its equivalent recorded for CILF by S. Lafage.A further important consideration is the presence of traces of orality in the Franco-African folktale that has only recently been committed to writing. The oral origins of the genre are seen in gesture and movement of the narrator, formulae such as set beginnings and endings to tales, and magic incantations. Songs and chants also play an important role.The Eurocentric nature of existing critical apparatus constitutes a major stumbling block for the researcher. When applying occidental taxonomy of the folktale to the African folktale, one realises that a direct application is not always possible because of various differences between the two groups. The taxonomy of the Franco-African folktale has to be of a fluid nature, since the various sub-genres tend to overlap and to coexist.The separation of the categories of tale, myth, legend and fable is difficult. The definition of the genres seems to differ from culture to culture, and overlapping occurs quite often. One often finds, for example, an etiological tale with a moral at the end that links it to the fable, or vice versa. Certain categories seem to bo absent from occidental folktales, such as the stories of terrible children (not to he confused with a trickster figure like Till eulenspiegel), dilemma and enigma tales and grammatical tales.The conclusion reached in the present exploration is that the models examined are not adequate for the analysis of the Franco-African folktale, because they do not take account of the differences inherent to the genre such as its greater sequential depth.",0
Rock Music and the Morals and Values of Teenagers: A Christian Perspective,"During the last two decades there has been a definite lowering of moral standards among the children of the West. This also pertains to the youth in South Africa. Among the many influences the child experiences in society, rock music, with its themes of sex, drugs, satanism, rebellion, materialism, secular humanism, suicide, nihilism, hedonism, blasphemy and profanity is possibly the most negative. Add to the above-mentioned, subliminal mind control and backward masking and it becomes clear why the Christian educator and the Christian parent must address the problem of rock and roll. Furthermore, rock music has directly or indirectly been responsible for much of the anti-social behaviour of present day youth. Tragically, modern day society is responsible for promoting the rock culture (with the help of modern technology), by making available to the youth of today records, videos and magazines, without realising the spiritual and moral damage they are causing. The modern day music entrepreneur has motives that are not honourable and not Christian as it is m?ney that makes the music go around.A very extensive literature study confirmed the above. As norms and values differ from culture to culture, the Christian norm was chosen as the irrevocable absolute norm rooted in the Word of God, to judge the morals upheld by the propagators of rock and roll. On the basis of the literature study done, an empirical investigation, formulating items obtained from the study for inclusion in the questionnaire, was conducted. The sample consisted of English speaking boys and girls in standard 7 and standard 9 from four high schools on the near East Rand. Cluster sampling was done by randomly selecting a class group from each of the standard 7 and standard 9 class groups of the four high schools concerned.     The interpretation and analysis of the processed data was done in two parts: The Descriptive Part and the Inferential Part. The findings summarily were that: church and youth activities were poorly attended;rock and roll is by far the most popular music style and is listened to on tape, radio and television;discos are more popular than rock concerts;much leisure time and money is spent on rock and roll; disco, techno and reggae rock were the most popular rock music forms;the groups propagating sex, drugs, the occult, protest and rebellion were all well supported;from the various groups and individuals listed Madonna was the most popular;only acid rock and to a lesser extent rock propagating certain aspects of the occult and false religion appear to have influenced the respondents' moral judgements sufficiently enough to be a matter of concern; despite the popularity of rock music it appears that its influence on the moral judgements of the white English speaking teenager is not very significant; and all in all this is very reassuring.However, despite the result of the research, the parents, teachers, the media and the church should continually evaluate rock music and expose it where it does not conform to the Christian norm.",0
"The Villancio in New Spain 1650-1750: Morphology, Significance and Development","For almost three centuries, the sacred villancico was the primary vernacular musical form of Spain and its New World colonies. Consisting of a through-composed estribillo, or refrain, and a set of strophic coplas, or verses, these ‘devout and honest songs’ (as they were styled by the Third Mexican Provincial Council of 1585) featured in the Matins services of the cathedrals and convents of Mexico throughout the colonial period. This thesis traces the morphology, development and significance of the villancico in New Spain during the one hundred year period from 1650 to 1750, examining the musical development of the genre within the institutional contexts of cathedral, convent and girls’ school. The biographies and villancico oeuvres of the composers Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, Antonio de Salazar, Manuel de Sumaya, and others who moved in their orbits are reconsidered in light of new music and documentation, while the supposed New World phenomenon of the villancico de negros, or African dialect villancico, receives fresh attention. In separate chapters, the feminine side of genre is examined. The musical aspects of the life of the Hieronymite nun Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz are considered from the viewpoint of the music historian, while the practice of the villancico in the feminine institutions of New Spain is explored. Focussing on period documents as a means of enriching the historical narrative, the thesis is intended as an interpretation of the villancico genre for the English-speaking reader.",0
Academic outcomes and new literacies evident during a digital storytelling unit within a secondary English class: A case study,"The purpose of this study was to identify the academic outcomes and new literacies evident during a digital storytelling unit within an English 12 classroom. Students wrote “This I Believe” essays recounting real experiences that led to a life lesson and created digital stories that utilized pictures, music, and narration. The following research questions were used to guide the study: (a) In what ways, if any, are new literacies evident during a digital storytelling unit within an English 12 classroom? (b) In what ways, if any, do students meet English 12 objectives related to the writing and language standards during a digital storytelling unit?   Qualitative data were collected and triangulated through observations and field notes, reflections, and final student artifacts. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method to identify common themes and patterns. The findings revealed four main areas in which new literacies were evident: working with ICTs and multimodal texts, locating information, evaluating information usefulness, and collaborative practices. Furthermore, the academic goals of the unit were met as evidenced in both student writing and the digital stories.    Students worked with and manipulated information and multimodal text using ICTs to create and share their projects. They located information for use within their projects as well as to solve issues that arose throughout the process. Once students were able to located information, they had to evaluate its usefulness within each situation to determine if it was beneficial or pertinent their needs. Furthermore, although these were individual projects, the unit was social in nature, and students work collaboratively to provide feedback, opinions, and help through the project. These transferable skills transcend knowledge that can be tested with a pen and paper, and these learning behaviors will help them work efficiently and effectively in modern society.    Student gains in motivation and new literacy skills and content mastery warrant more project-based learning such as digital storytelling. However, assumptions should not be made regarding student technology skills such as emailing, file structure, and search techniques. Instead, teachers need to continue to teach these skills within the classroom to provide professional experience with these types of literacies. Furthermore, schools must seek to build a robust inventory of devices and platforms, while establishing a robust infrastructure to support these devices during projects. Finally, professional development and support are key factors in the success of teacher implementation of these units; therefore, schools that want to make the shift to allowing students to interact with new literacies, need to make sure they have a solid professional development plan and ample support for teachers and students.    Researchers have shown that students need new literacy skills in order to live and work in modern society; therefore, teachers must consider new methods in order to meet this need. Based on the results of this study, digital storytelling is a method of providing students with the opportunity to interact with new literacy skills within a secondary English classroom without sacrificing traditional objectives and academic outcomes.",0
An applied voice teacher's process to teach singers to embody articulatory skills towards a resolution to problematic phonemes: Three case studies,"The purpose of this study was to address diction challenges caused by inexperience with foreign languages, anatomical challenges, and skill disparities that impair singers' coordination and articulation to sing with clear, accurate diction in the applied voice studio. Three case studies were administered: (a) rolling [r],  (b) clusters, and (c) lisping. Five singers participated in the study. The strategies employed to embody skills development that increased articulatory functionality were articulator exercises, text isolation, and repetition. The amelioration focused on individual needs using improvisatory adjustments relevant to enhancing their productivity.      To involve the singers in a collaborative, productive diction lesson, Mezirow's transformative learning (TL) theory guided the dialogic interaction in the study. Fostering TL challenged the tradition of the applied lessons expert/apprentice system, in which the teacher--the expert--is the primary source of knowledge. TL advocates that both the teacher's and the student's prior knowledge contribute to their learning experience. The tenets of TL were identified during the singers' participation in the study. The investigator incorporated collaborative dialogue and critical self-reflection to engage the singers in a deeper and meaningful experience.     The results solidified the importance of diction lessons that address diction maladies. One dominant reason the singers had difficulty with articulation was their lack of experience with foreign languages despite their course requirements on the collegiate level. Modeling, discourse, a progression of vocalises for skill building to improve articulatory function, and self-reflection all served to increase self-correction both in the studio and personal practice.",0
A pedogogical discussion of five french twentieth-century piano pieces for progressive study,"This document provides a pedagogical study of five works for younger pianists by twentieth-century French composers. The works are Jeu  by Darius Milhaud, Petite suite serieuse pour concert de famille by Besty Jolas, Les fleurs endormies by Marcel Landowski, A la maniere...d'un violon by Raymond Loucher, and L'histoire de Babar by Francis Poulenc. Each work is published individually by the French editor Gerard Billaudot and is a part of a collection of twenty-seven teaching pieces specifically designated  pour les jeunes (""for young people"").  These works can be used as an introduction to modern French piano music for elementary through early-advanced students. This subject is of great importance as such works are rarely found in student-level repertoire and method books. The selections are presented in the order of progressive study, each accompanied with a detailed discussion, so that the teacher may decide on how best to integrate the compositions into their students' training.  It is possible to use all five pieces with one student in a graduated progression; but the discussions are presented with one composition per chapter so that an instructor may go immediately to the piece that most closely reflects their student's current level. These solo piano works can equip the student with the skills necessary to play more difficult French twentieth-century repertoire, such as Ravel's Sonatine or one of the Debussy Préludes.",0
Julius Otto Kaiser and his method of systematic indexing: An early indexing system in its historical context,"Julius Otto Kaiser (1968–1927) was a special librarian and indexer who developed, in last years of the 19th and the first years of the 20th centuries, an innovative method of subject indexing known as systematic indexing (SI). Although Kaiser has long been recognized as a pioneer in the field of knowledge organization (KO) and SI has been considered to be a theoretically significant knowledge organization system (KOS), little has been known about his life and, to date, discussion of his system has, with rare exceptions, tended to focus on two features of his system: (1) its use of a limited set of categories to partition an index vocabulary into classes of terms and (2) its stipulation of syntactic rules for combining terms into complex index terms. The aim of the present investigation is to provide a more detailed and historically informed account of SI and its creator than has hitherto been attempted so as to contribute to a better understanding of the design features of the system and the rationale underwriting them. To this end, the study addresses three questions: What was Kaiser's background and what was the character of the milieux in which he created and developed his indexing system? What were the main methodological and theoretical features of SI as he conceptualized them? And how did the milieux in which he worked shape the design of his system and his conceptualization thereof?   A biographical framing of Kaiser and SI shows that, after receiving a trades-oriented elementary and secondary education in the German city of Stuttgart and working as a free-lance teacher of language and music and, later, a private school teacher in Queensland and Chile, Kaiser entered into library and indexing work at the Bureau of Information of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum (PCM) in 1896, where he conceived of, and began to develop, his indexing system. Subsequently, in 1899, he moved to London where he worked successively for the Commercial Intelligence Bureau, Ltd.; the British Westinghouse Company, Ltd.; and the Tariff Commission, a private research organization associated with the Joseph Chamberlain's Tariff Reform movement, all the while refining his system of indexing. During his tenure at the Commission, he published his two major works, The Card System at the Office (1908) and Systematic Indexing (1911), both of them directed to a business-managerial readership. Having gained a reputation as an indexing expert in the wake of these publications, Kaiser subsequently was engaged to reorganize the correspondence department of the munitions firm Vickers et al. and the works library at the Ardeer factory of Nobel's Explosives Company, Ltd. In 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, Kaiser returned to the United States, where he eventually found work as a bibliographic researcher at the Engineering Societies Library in New York and as an editor, reviewer of foreign journals, and indexer with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 1926, apparently at the behest of colleagues in Great Britain, he wrote a summary exposition of SI for the third conference of the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux, which brought his system into the public eye once more. Shortly after undertaking work to reorganize the library at the Experimental Station of the Hercules Powder Company in Kenvil, Delaware, in 1927, Kaiser died in an automobile accident; after his death, interest in SI was largely restricted to British industrial librarians until the 1950s, when it became known to the broader communities of general librarians and information scientists.    Finally, this study demonstrates that some of the central features of SI were strongly conditioned by the discursive and institutional milieux in which Kaiser worked, particularly the Bureau of Information at the PCM where he first developed his system, as well as by his personal temperament and epistemological views. His conception of the function of the intelligence department and his views on analytical indexing, or information analysis, seem to have derived from the informational régime of PCM's Bureau, while his system of term categories was based, at least in part, on categories used at the Bureau to structure its system of index files and, more broadly, at the PCM to organize its museal exhibits. Kaiser, then, was very much a child of the times and socio-professional circumstances in which he lived and in which he developed SI: nevertheless, certain features of his indexing system, such as its principled use of categories; incorporation of polyhierarchical classificatory structures into its cross-referential structure; and generally domain-analytical approach to knowledge organization still make it highly relevant to ongoing theoretical and methodological discussions within the field of KO.

The making of an opera coach,"The purpose of this study was to define the opera coaching profession through descriptions provided by its members, with the aim of discovering and describing the skills required to be a successful opera coach and the different types of experiences that can lead to the acquisition of those skills. It also examined ways in which coaches define themselves and the profession. For the purpose of this study, the term opera coach is defined as a pianist who coaches singers in operatic literature.    An online questionnaire was sent to 388 professional opera coaches who had listings in the Coach and Accompanist Directory of Classical Singer  magazine. Ninety-eight coaches completed the first part of the questionnaire, which gathered factual data about the respondents' backgrounds and asked them to measure their opinions of the importance of skills and experiences. Seventy-two of the respondents also answered open-ended questions about their personal experiences and their thoughts and feelings regarding the profession.    Results indicate that the working lives of contemporary opera coaches are characterized by multiplicity in work environments, in types of work performed, and in skills required for opera coaching work. Self-definition as an opera coach did not appear to be dependent on full-time work in the field, and the vast majority of respondents also did other types of work. The field itself is characterized by diversity, particularly in the educational and background experiences of coaches, and the profession appears to lack a clear developmental path. Developing a wide variety of skills was considered to be of primary importance, and the top-ranked skills were verbal communication skills, knowledge of the operatic literature, foreign language and/or diction skills, and knowledge of operatic performance practice. While respondents tended to be highly educated, opinions on the importance of education varied, and most respondents claimed to have learned the most through experience. It also appears that opera coaches are focused on and rewarded by helping singers, and are lifelong learners driven by love of the work.",0
On the holistic teaching of primary school pupil's english grammar,"Translation from original language as provided by authorThe primary purpose of the grammar instruction is to help students use English correctly and appropriately, while in practice, most of the classroom time is devoted to the teaching and memorization of grammatical rules and mechanical drill patterns. It is justified for teachers to pass on grammatical knowledge in this way, but more importantly they should try every possible means to encourage students to practice and use such rules. The teaching and learning of grammar is a continuous process. Effective learning occurs when learners can apply the rules they have learned to meaningful communicative situations, even if explicit grammatical references have already been made by the teacher. Structure should not be isolated from the whole language context. Pattern drilling will have to be integrated with textbooks and communicative activities so as to develop students' grammatical and communicative competence in the process of using the language. We should teach grammar in the holistic way. Learning grammar is a complicated process which requires the teacher to design lots of meaningful context and useful practice. Such repeated but meaningful practice will arouse students' attention to language form. Most students are not really interested in learning the language system. What they hope to learn is the meaning and function conveyed by the form. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to find out an effective way in grammar teaching. As language teachers, we should encourage students to use grammar correctly and appropriately in meaningful communication. What students need is not long-time explanation or detailed input, but the chance to use the language themselves. Teachers should create meaningful practice for the students and encourage them to experience and do by themselves, not let the students just sit and listen to someone else telling them about how to do it. Students in many classes do not need long explanations or detailed information. What they tend to need more are challenging opportunities to try using the language items themselves. Thus the writer tries to teach grammar in different contexts, such as stories, dialogues, rhymes and songs to create a real situation for them to practice grammar. The ultimate purpose of teaching grammar in the holistic way is to improve students' ability to use language. This article is composed of five parts. The first part is a brief introduction to grammar teaching. The second part discusses the development of grammar teaching. The third part is focused on the holistic teaching of grammar, involving its definition, its practice in real classroom settings, as well as the significance and pros and cons. The fourth part is to test the effects of holistic teaching of primary English grammar based on the oral examination, the written examination and the survey. The fifth part is to summarize the results and enlightenment of this",0
A study on c-e translation of classical chinese poetry based on susan bassnett's translation theories,"Translation from original language as provided by authorTranslation between Chinese and English is at once one of the most important and one of the most difficult communication activities in the world. Classical Chinese poetry, in turn, which takes unique qualities of classical Chinese to their extremes, is even more difficult to be translated into English. Is C-E translation of classical Chinese verse possible at all? And if it is, what principles should be followed in the translation process? This study attempts to discuss such questions based on translation theories of Professor Susan Bassnett, who have attained great attention because of her deep insight into translation issues. the first chapter is a brief introduction to Professor Bassnett's discussion on central issues in translation studies, as is carried out in her monograph Translation Studies, which is considered a milestone in the development of translation studies. It is found that Bassnett regards absolute equivalence in translation non-existent at all, and untranslatability an inevitable issue in all translation processes. Chapter Two discusses untranslatability issue in C-E translation of classical Chinese verse based on Bassnett's ideas on untranslatability issue. Bassnett quotes and agrees with Popovic's distinguishing of two types of untranslatability: untranslatability caused by inadequacy of relative linguistic elements in TL and untranslatability caused by inadequacy of relative relationship between the creative subject and its expression. The first type of untranslatability of classical Chinese verse takes place on levels of visual form, auditory effects and grammar. For visual form, the hieroglyphic nature of Chinese characters lend implications and associations to expressions other than their contextual meaning, which is very difficult to be reproduced in English, which is a language of alphabetic script; on the other hand, the visual brevity and regularity, brought about by regular lengths of lines in the written form of classical Chinese verse, is also difficult to be reproduced in English, which consists of words with irregular number of alphabets. For auditory effects, the monosyllabic nature of Chinese characters, the tone language nature of Chinese language and all-pervading rhyme consist elementary characteristics of auditory effects of classical Chinese verse, lending it unique musicality, which, however, is very difficult to be transmitted to English, which is a multi-syllabic, intonation language. For grammar, the complete uninflected nature of Chinese, the frequent appearance of omission and inversion in syntactical terms, and the fluidity of parts of speech all pose difficulty in C-E translation of classical Chinese poetry. The second type of untranslatability in C-E translation of classical Chinese poetry is divided into two parts in this study: untranslatability caused by obviously culture-loaded expressions and by culture-bound expressions on a more subtle level. However, despite all untranslatable elements, it does not mean C-E translation of classical Chinese verse is an impossible mission. The first part of Chapter Three firstly introduces Bassnett's discussion on the possibility of poetry translation. According to Bassnett, though a poem cannot be mechanically reduplicated in TL, it can be ""transplanted"" in TL soil, in which process a new flower grows out of the same seed. Bassnett claims the translator of a poem should first of all be a good reader, who understands and absorbs the original poem to such an extent that a new poem begins to grow. During the translation, Bassnett argues the translator should follow Shelly's ""organic"" method, to start from the content of the poem itself, and to allow the sentences form themselves. The creativity released by the original author should be fully utilized by the translator, so that the translation is a work of art in its own right, with its own vitality. The second part of Chapter Three are some case studies of C-E translation of classical Chinese verse from the perspective of Bassnett's translation theory of ""transplanting the seed"". Chapter Four, the Conclusion, points out that the purpose of an account of untranslatability of classical Chinese poetry is not to deny the possibility of translating it into English, but to be fully informed of inherent limitations entailed by such a task. Excellent C-E translations of classical Chinese poetry do exist, and although nearly all of them seem a departure from the original version, they invariably succeed in representing the artistic appeal of the original poem. What's more, these translations are real poems in their own right, with their own vitality. Key Words: C-E translation; Classical Chinese poetry; Susan Bassnett; untranslatability; transplanting the seed; organic",0
A study of the effects of english teachers' homework feedback on students' motivation,"Translation from original language as provided by authorAlong with the enhancement of the trend of globalization, as the language for international communication, English has played an unassailable role. Numerous scholars and educators are increasingly concerned about the teaching concepts and teaching methods for English language. One educator once said that: ""The teacher is not to teach, but to inspire, awaken and encourage"". The modern teaching theory also believes that the teaching process is not only to teach the students to learn the scientific and cultural knowledge, skills and methods, but also to integrate the sense, motivation, interest, emotion and will organically. Thus it can be seen that the teaching staff now concentrate on the study motivation and emotional factors of learners and find out that the teachers play a significant role in the students' motivation. Feedback is important in teaching; therefore, the great role of teachers' feedback in the language study must not be overlooked. Based on the theories of feedback, motivation and emotional education and the design principles for questionnaire, through the investigation of questioning and interviewing and combined with the teaching practice, this thesis aims to find out the effects of English teachers' homework feedback on students' motivation, think of the existing problems, put forward certain suggestions and help the teachers find more efficient way so as to improve the students' mental mood, motivate their study motivation and enhance their English. With the help of 10 English teachers and 100 students at one key senior high school in Songyuan city, the study on ""the Effects of English Teachers' Homework Feedback on Students' Motivation"" has been completed. According to the investigation result and teaching practice, this thesis puts forward that: 1) the homework designing should be optimized; 2) teachers' feedback should be timely, objective, fair and complete; 3) the mode of teachers' feedback should be diversified; 4) the individual difference among students should be considered; 5) the positive feedbacks should be applied reasonably and",0
An analysis of orchestral arrangements of songs for voice and piano by Maurice Ravel with an arrangement of “Shéhérazade” for voice and chamber ensemble,"This thesis investigates the historical context, examines stylistic issues, and offers a technical analysis of eleven songs for voice and orchestra by Ravel. Chapter I outlines the historical context of the French song, focusing on compositions written for voice and orchestra, as well as offering an overview of Ravel’s contribution to the genre of orchestral song. Chapter II reviews technical and stylistic aspects of French orchestral writing and principal influences on Ravel in the area of orchestration. It then discusses specific characteristics of Ravel’s orchestration style, their evolution, and their relationship to his writing for the piano.   After this general exploration of historical context and technical vocabulary, chapter III offers a detailed analysis of each of eleven songs, with direct comparisons between the piano and orchestral versions. In addition to technical analysis, this chapter investigates the historical background and contemporary critical reception of each song. Chapter III also offers an overview of the existing manuscripts and other primary sources, as well as available present-day research.    Finally, the thesis includes an appendix that contains an arrangement of Ravel’s early orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade  for voice and chamber ensemble. The instrumentation of this arrangement consists of piano, string quartet, two flutes and two clarinets, and is modeled on Ravel’s Trois Poèmes de Stéphane Mallarmé.",0
The influence of english inns existed in 16th and 17th century on profane drama of early modern times,"Translation from original language as provided by authorFrom historical perspective, this paper studies the English inns, during their golden age in A.D.1500-1700, how to play a important role in the development of profane drama. Moreover, thanks to English inns, profane drama achieved glorious success at that time. In those years, Protestant Reformation is accomplished in England, as well as commodity economy expanded. Considering that technology of producing beer made a progress and domestic improvement of public transport, not only the number of inns was increasing rapidly, but various inns spread all over the England. They not just function as taverns and alehouse, but turn into the primary communicational place and the entertainment center, dramas and music was often performed in the inns. At the same time, due to the decline of Christian drama, profane drama appeared in the 16th century. With the help and protection of Queen Elizabeth I and the aristocracy, professional actors and troupes emerged. Owing to the dramas close to social life, and the lines quite easy to understand for common people, profane drama is popular with Englishmen. As the ideal place for staging plays, inns are the cradle of actors and playwrights. A large number of people become theatre fans enjoying plays in inns. I try to use core historical materials to prove the contribution that inns made for English theatre, by key factors for profane drama: place for performance, actors, playwrights, audiences. The article falls into 4 chapters. The first chapter sums up the prosperity of inns and the generation of drama. Pointing out the reason of prosperity, I described the scene of inns spread all over England. Beside that, the situation of English society in 16th century is introduced, Queen Elizabeth I and the aristocracy sponsored profane drama, which is primary condition for drama. With the economy growth of middle-class and underclass, most of them are educated, as a result profane drama owned big market and some excellent playwrights. So the drama got a good chance. The second chapter discusses the importance of inns for drama from the aspect of performing place. First of all, I analyze why inns become the ideal place for drama, then prove inns is fit for plays by taking some typical examples, such as Red Bull inn in London. Afterwards, I point out the influence which inn-owners on the theatre, such as James Burbage, Philip Henslowe. They are not only agents of troupe, but also administrators. They struggle for troupe and manage the agency by the business way, in the end the market got bigger day by day, so that actors could concentrate in improving their acting. Next section focuses on the emergence of theatre. Depend on inn-owners' sponsor, the earliest theatres appeared in London. However, due to authority and puritans' opposition, theatres obliged to close. At last, profane drama has no choice but inns. The third chapter summarizes the relationship between actors and playwrights. At first, presenting the emergence of professional actors in England, these actors learned various performing skills from musicians and barnstormers in inns. It strengthened their quality, in addition that some barnstormers turned into buffoons. Next section pointing the experience earned from inns influenced playwrights who often stay in there strongly, such as Marlowe, Greene. Various men in inns as playwrights' archetypes become the characters in dramas. Just in inns, they obtained inspiration, learned humorous expressions from the public. Then I discuss in the process of troupes rehearse plays and trouping around England, inn-owners provide great support all the time. For this reason, the inn is extremely important to actors and playwrights. The fourth chapter pays attention to audiences of profane drama. After Christian drama died out, customers in inns are eager to watch plays approach to their life, full of humors, and they love complicated stories. Accordingly, profane drama is fit for their appetite, plenty of common people and aristocrats going into inns become theatre fans. These faithful fans spend lots of money in the theatre, moreover they help troupes overcome the difficulties, a number of audience devote into troupes doing actors. Thanks to their assistant, troupes expanded gradually, and inns act as the storage of",0
Visionary philology: Geoffrey Hill and the study of language,"This thesis examines the relation of Geoffrey Hill’s poetry and criticism to three chapters in the history of linguistic thought.  Part one delineates a primarily Augustinian tradition in the theology of language, dominated by ideas of original sin and grace.  It examines the several means by which Hill has fitted his poetic language to the task of imagining its own prelapsarian conditions, including considerations of Adamic and angelic languages, and of the prelapsarian claims of Hebrew and music.  And it then examines the sources for Hill’s understanding of sin and grace, and the importance of these ideas in his linguistic thought.  Part two considers a broadly conceived, primarily seventeenth-century philosophical tendency, exemplified in Bacon, Hobbes and Locke, to seek the eradication of ambiguity, to make language into a fit instrument for communication and learning, and to stress the arbitrariness of words in relation to the ideas they denote.  It then examines Hill’s response to this tendency, first in his critical prose, implicating questions of equivocation, context and etymology, and then in his poetry, ending with a sustained reading of ideas of ‘play’ and ‘plain speaking’ in his work.  Part three considers the nineteenth century philological movement in England whose primary impetus is towards historicity.  It examines Hill’s affinities with, in turn, Coleridge, R. C. Trench, and the Oxford English Dictionary, before concluding with an account of the third edition of the dictionary’s reciprocal attention to Hill’s vocabulary.  The primary focus of the thesis is on Hill’s poetry from Canaan (1996) onwards, although his earlier poetry is also taken into account.  Critical writings from across the whole span of his writing career are considered.",0
Motivational beliefs about music and six other school subjects: The Mexican context,"Motivation research in education seeks to understand how people's beliefs impact on achievement and participation. The purpose of this study was to examine what motivates students' and classroom teachers' involvement and achievement in school music, as compared to six other school subjects (Math, Spanish, History, Science, Physical Education, and Art). In México, as in other countries around the world, music is at the edge of the curriculum. A deeper understanding of teachers and students' motivational beliefs is needed in order to define strategies to foster higher levels of involvement and achievement in school music.    Questionnaires based on the Expectancy-Value Model of Achievement Performance and Choice were used to examine the motivational profiles of 3,613 Mexican students (grades 4-12) and 91 elementary classroom teachers (grades 1-6). This theoretical framework proposes that achievement and choice behaviors are predicted by two general components: expectancies for success on a task (perceptions of competence, confidence, and task difficulty), and the subjective values attached to the task (importance, interest, usefulness).    Results of confirmatory factor analyses support the theoretical constructs of expectancies and values as the main factors explaining both student and teacher motivation. Results of the analysis of variance suggest that expectancies and value beliefs attached to music were similar for both students and teachers. Music was considered the least valued of the seven school subjects with both students and teachers holding lower expectations for success in learning and teaching this subject. Overall, teachers showed higher expectancies and value beliefs toward the academic subjects (Math, Spanish, Science, and History) than did students. Students who were learning an instrument or voice displayed distinctly more positive motivation toward music and all other subjects than did non-music learners. No significant differences, however, were found in teachers' motivation to teach music, even for those who possessed a musical background. The findings of the study highlight the need to change perceptions by addressing misconceptions about the nature of music as a school subject and by educating teachers, parents, educational authorities, and students about the value of music in students' overall education.",0
“Another music of the soul”: The musical aesthetics of Alphonse de Lamartine,"This dissertation examines the musicological significance of the nineteenth-century French writer and politician Alphonse de Lamartine (1790-1869) by analyzing his philosophy of and involvement in the musical arts. Though little studied from a musical perspective today, Lamartine was a dominant figure in the literature and politics of mid-century Europe and had personal relationships with many prominent artists, including composers such as Liszt, Chopin, and Rossini. A childhood enriched by religious hymns and Enlightenment airs led to an early career colored by Italian opera; in later years he would turn to philosophical inquiries about music. Lamartine's commentary on the composers and musical genres of his epoch offers valuable insight into nineteenth-century music reception and, more broadly, Romantic aesthetics. His long critical essay ""The Music of Mozart"" (1858) and numerous other works (including poetry, prose, orations, and letters) take on central issues in the philosophy of music.    Lamartine maintained throughout his career that poetry is the mode of expression par excellence; however, as I show in Chapter One, his writings on music augment this view by claiming that music, by its particular non-reliance on verbal content, can surpass the syntactical grammar of the written and spoken word. Lamartine also extends such categorical investigations to the world of music alone, asking whether music with or music without lyrics or textual associations possesses a greater aesthetic import. He concludes that each artistic language consists of its own complete and independent grammar and is therefore most powerful when uncomplicated by dependence on an adjoining artistic medium. His belief that instrumental music merits the greatest praise within the musical arts (the subject of Chapter Two) is linked to his reverence for the divinity of nature (Chapter Three), within which he finds the purest musical expression known to humanity. It is also from his perspective on the natural world that he derives a means by which to measure a composer's genius—such as Mozart (Chapter Four) and Rossini (Chapter Five)—as well as the moral and spiritual value of different musical genres, such as opera (Chapter Six). By presenting and analyzing Lamartine's music theory and criticism, I hope to contribute to a modern understanding of French Romanticism and of this important historical figure.",0
Tonality and chromaticism in Hans Werner Henze's early operas,"Regarded as one of the most prolific twentieth-century composers, Hans Werner Henze is particularly famous for his remarkable output for the stage. Yet, current music scholarship, particularly in English speaking countries, responds to Henze's operas only sporadically. Studies in German, understandably more in quantity, approach his operas from a limited analytical perspective resulting in an incomplete understanding of dramatic issues. Devoting more attention to librettos as the primary source of dramatic content, these studies remain at the descriptive level in their consideration of the music, and neglect a thorough analysis of the musical textures in their entirety.   Taking four operas composed in the ten-year period from 1955 to 1965 as its point of departure, the present study examines characteristic elements of Henze's musical language in order to clarify issues related to dramatic action. Henze recalls his growing frustration with the music aesthetic views cultivated during this period, which he considers as his break with the aesthetic aspirations of the so-called Darmstadt School. Coupled with his permanent move to Italy, the polarity he claims to have existed around mid-twentieth century marks a change in Henze's aesthetic views. The operas considered in this study reflect a rejection of the modernist concerns. But Henze does not abandon serial techniques categorically; rather he refrains from a dogmatic approach to serial techniques and combines them with other styles. My analyses concentrate specifically on strategies of creating tonal allusions, closely related to his idiosyncratic twelve-tone technique, and the typically dissonant stratified textures that recur in the operas under investigation. Particularly in Der Prinz von Homburg and The Bassarids Henze tackles the task of uniting his twelve-tone method with tonal allusions to delineate dramatic action.",0
How the characteristic of chinese teaching resources for children in korea have inspired the compilation of chinese teaching materials for children abroad,"Translation from original language as provided by authorOne feature of globalization at this time means that cultural dissemination carries great significance; it has become one kind of important ""soft strength"". The cultural output is playing an influential but imperceptible role in the great nation competition. In order to achieve the internalization of Chinese culture, the Chinese education of overseas children is worth taking seriously. if Chinese culture is instilled into these foreign children from early childhood this is the best way to enable them to develop good sentiments towards China. The promotion of Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language education, enables them to have the favorable impression of China, For people to have this sentiment since childhood, is best method for China to rise peacefully in the global stage. Children's Chinese is a foundational strategy, the future project, has the profound important meaning to the development of China's entire enterprise of teaching Chinese as a foreign language The foreigners Studying Chinese abroad are different from those who study in China. The overseas environment gives them no opportunity or to speak Chinese. If we want to improve the quality of teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language, we have to compile a set of the teaching material which takes account of the local conditions, to meet the needs in their own country. When I teach in South Korea, if I use Chinese generated materials there are many cultural concepts with which the children are unfamiliar and need to be explained; so I prefer to use the local Chinese teaching materials which have been compiled by Koreans. Then all I have to do is to focus on drilling the students in sentence patterns and practice conversation, This way is more convenient. In the process of using the South Korean produced Chinese teaching material, I found some differences between the South Korean and the Chinese produced Chinese teaching material, I thought that by learning from others I may benefit by capitalizing on the other's strong points. I then had the idea to analysis and study the South Korean Chinese teaching material for children. At present there are not many research paper on the South Korean teaching material in China, although South Korea is the biggest user of Chinese language study. It is stated in the literature that the foreign language teaching material divide into ""the adult teaching material"" and ""the child teaching material"", ""the general teaching material"" and ""nationality specific material"", the author thought discussing how to organize the synthesis of Chinese teaching material for foreign children with the nationality specific teaching material will be a meaningful subject. In chapter six part four ""proposed the new task for compiling the teaching material"", the author proposes to develop a set of complete integrated teaching package, which gives detailed instructions for the whole teaching process for example when to use what kind of teaching material, how the teacher should use the teaching activity. It should include materials to use for singing, every kind of teaching tools (character card, flash card, transparency, handouts , test paper, teacher's manual, audio and video product and outline wall chart) which each teaching activity needs. In order to meet domestic and foreign Chinese teacher's teaching needs, it can help the teachers to prepare lessons well and the organization of classroom instruction, It offers training services in language skill and language communication to the student, as well as providing facilities to enhance teaching quality. This essay; through researching the way of presentation of South Korea's children's Chinese teaching material aims to be a reference source which acts as an inspiration for those compilers of overseas children's Chinese teaching",0
"Do video conferencing and supportive interactive whiteboard tasks provide a positive modern language learning experience for pupils in years 2, 3, and 6?","This thesis investigates participantsâ�� affective experience of target language (French) speaking in videoconferencing links with peer native speakers and also of supportive interactive whiteboard tasks implemented by class teachers in the classroom in the absence of the teacher/researcher who designed them.    Findings are based on formative and exploratory research carried out with years 2, 3 and 6 classes in an English primary school classroom in which the researcher taught ML on a regular weekly basis to all age-groups. The majority of data is qualitative and was collected over a period of 18 months through questionnaires, group and individual interviews, classroom observation and informal discussions.    The thesis begins by providing a context for the schools E (in England) and F (in France) and their ML teaching practices as well as the designs of IWB tasks for ML learning in school E.Â  Chapters 2 and 3 further contextualise the study with a literature review of firstly, models of learning for modern languages in primary schools and secondly, the potential role of information and communication technologies (ICTs).Â  Chapter 4 describes the methods used and chapter 5 provides an outline of two frameworks used for analysing data.Â  Chapter 6 describes participantsâ�� orientedness towards the research activities.    Empirical findings are analysed in chapter 7 which addresses the IWB tasks and chapters 8 and 9 which present and discuss participantsâ�� affective experience of videoconferencing.    Findings suggest the majority of pupils of all three age-groups enjoyed videoconferencing tasks when supported by the researchersâ�� non-literature predominantly semiological systems, learnt previously in lessons in conjunction with target language (TL) set to rhythms/music named â��language vehiclesâ��.Â  Class teachers with little ML knowledge implemented classroom IWB tasks but needed to adapt their role in class.",0
Speaking the unspeakable: a comparative approach to representations of child sexual abuse in english- and german-speaking literature of the twentieth century,"Child sexual abuse has undergone a great change in the course of the twentieth century, from being a taboo in large areas of the western culture to being revealed by feminists to be a prevalent as well as destructive practice, to being now an open and widely-discussed social topic.Â  Western literature reflects this development, for the topic has become one of considerable weight in both fictional and autobiographical texts of the past few decades.Â  However, this change has not been paralleled by a similar interest in literary criticism where the topic still suffers from undervaluation, neglect, and denial.Â  The objective of this thesis is to fill this gap through exploring the theme in selected works of the English- and German-speaking literature of the twentieth century.Â  In re-reading canonical texts, such as Thomas Mannâ��s Der Tod in Venedig, Iris Murdochâ��s The Bell, and Vladimir Nabokovâ��s Lolita, I argue that the eroticised child character has been marginalised and neglected by both the texts and their critics.Â  In contrast, second-wave feminism produced literature that is acutely aware of child sexual abuse and its destructive effects on its victims.Â  Elisabeth Reichartâ��s â��La Valseâ��, Dea Loherâ��s TÃ€towierung and Jane Smileyâ��s A Thousand Acres, but also pioneering texts such as Ingeborg Bachmannâ��s Malina and Djuna Barnesâ�� The Antiphon, illustrate the new social awareness of the problem and contextualise it within the sexual politics of gender oppression.Â  Comparison of these texts with Afro-American literature, including Maya Angelouâ��s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Toni Morrisonâ��s The Bluest Eye brings in new insights concerning the portrayal of the abusive father and the social conditioning of child abuse.Â  Contemporary male literary texts, including Bernhard Schlinkâ��s Der Vorleser and Ian McEwanâ��s Atonement push the argument further by addressing issues ignored by women writers such as male victims, female offenders, and false testimony.",0
Importance and availability of content and communication skills among entry-level interpretive naturalists,"Interpretation seeks to help visitors to make intellectual and emotional connections between themselves and park resources through a communication process. To accomplish this goal, interpreters must be intimately knowledgeable of park resources as well as excellent communicators. The details of what types of knowledge and communication skills are most important to interpretive naturalists have not been formally documented. Likewise, little is formally known about the availability of each skill in pools of entry-level applicants for interpretive positions. This study documented the varying importance and availability of content and communication skills for entry-level interpretive naturalists, based on the perceptions of experienced interpreters. A web-based survey was sent to members of the Interpretive Naturalist subsection of the National Association for Interpretation (NAI) (n=867) as well as to several interpreters from special park districts who were encouraged to send it on to other interpreters they knew. Responses were received from 308 interpreters. The survey measured respondents' perceptions of the importance and availability of content and communication skills desired by organizations in entry-level interpreters. The five most important content skills were Field Ecology, Field Ornithology, Conservation Biology, Field Botany, and Field Mammalogy, while the five most important communication skills were improvisational skills, understanding how children of different ages learn, ability to read their audience, good voice, and ability to write lesson plans/program outlines. Grid analysis was used to display the importance and availability data. The only content skill that was located in the important but unavailable quadrant was Field Geology (rocks and minerals).    Content skills that were viewed as being important and readily available included Conservation Biology, Field Botany, Field Dendrology, Field Ecology, Field Entomology, Field Herpetology, Field Mammalogy, Field Ornithology, and History. Content skills that were that were viewed as being unimportant consisted of Anthropology, Archaeology, Astronomy, European settlers' homestead and craft skills, Field geology (fossils), Field Ichthyology, Field Limnology, Field Marine Biology, Field Mycology, Field Oceanography, Folklore, Meteorology, and Native American skills.    Communication skills that were viewed as being important but unavailable were interpretive planning, interpretive writing, knowledge of state curriculum standards, storytelling, and understanding international visitors. Communication skills that were viewed as being important and readily available were ability to read their audience, ability to write lesson plans/program outlines, audio-visual equipment operation, conflict resolution skills, good voice, improvisational skills, understanding disabilities, understanding how children of different ages learn, understanding of ethnic and racial groups, and visual communications.    Communication skills that were viewed as being unimportant included costuming, exhibit construction, foreign language, graphical communication, interpretive theater, marketing, mechanical skills, music performance, music editing, supervisory skills, video editing, webpage design, woodworking skills, animal handling/husbandry, art, digital photo editing, outdoor skills, and photography.    In addition to determining the importance and availability of a variety of content and communication skills, this study also looked at how music was currently being used in interpretation. Frequently reported skills that were currently available were ""none of the above"" followed by singing and playing an instrument. The most frequently selected category for musical skills desired by interpretive centers was playing instruments and singing. The most commonly reported musical activities used at centers were leading children in signing songs, having musical acts perform and playing musical recordings.    Study results can be used by universities in revising curricula and advising students interested in environmental interpretation. Persons interested in becoming entry-level employees may use these data in making decisions about preparing themselves to be competitive in the job market and by park staff in designing training for seasonal interpreters.",0
Dramatic slowness: Adagio rhetoric in late nineteenth-century Austro-German music,"In Austro-German music of the late nineteenth century, the landscape of extreme musical slowness took on a powerful, new identity. This dissertation examines this phenomenon through a series of case studies focusing on works of Bruckner, Wagner, and Mahler. Combining close musical analysis with a consideration of reception discourse and contemporary aesthetic theory, this work sheds new light on a largely overlooked Adagio ""rhetoric."" This vocabulary of musical slowness shapes and responds to habits of listening and musical comprehension in the last decades of the century.    Departing from tradition, the Adagio of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony was of unprecedented importance in characterizing the complete work for its early audiences. While this was typical for chamber works, slow movements of symphonies were not regularly accorded such prominence. The pivotal role of the Adagio within Bruckner's symphony signals the arrival of a rich moment in nineteenth-century music. Symphonic aesthetics are re-defined, and listening habits associated with the intimate realm of chamber music are now aligned with the public genre of the symphony. In discussing this work, the concept of the ""lyric"" provides a fertile context by which to identify and analyze the particular elements of Bruckner's Adagio style.    In Wagner's Parsifal, the topic of slowness is especially complex. As much as the work itself, its performance history has influenced the understanding of tempo in the piece. Wagner's own opinions on tempo illuminate those passages in Parsifal that are markedly slow. An analysis of the Act I Prelude and Grail Scene suggests points of intersection between Wagner's slow tempi and the vocabulary of Adagio style. Issues of form, timbre, rhythm, and melodic design challenge the perception of goal-oriented musical time by emphasizing the individuality of discrete moments.    In Mahler's Third Symphony, the final movement represents a continuation of these same trends. Satisfying the requirements for a solemn Adagio and a grand Finale, this movement echoes and expands the elements of Adagio rhetoric identified in Bruckner and Wagner. Trends in reception suggest that Mahler's identity as composer and conductor was a primary influence in defining the public and historical image of the piece.",0
The pedagogical legacy of Johann Nepomuk Hummel,"Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837), a student of Mozart and Haydn, and colleague of Beethoven, made a spectacular ascent from child-prodigy to pianist-superstar. A composer with considerable output, he garnered enormous recognition as piano virtuoso and teacher. Acclaimed for his dazzling, beautifully clean, and elegant legato playing, his superb pedagogical skills made him a much sought after and highly paid teacher.    This dissertation examines Hummel's eminent role as piano pedagogue reassessing his legacy. Furthering previous research (e.g. Karl Benyovszky, Marion Barnum, Joel Sachs) with newly consulted archival material, this study focuses on the impact of Hummel on his students. Part One deals with Hummel's biography and his seminal piano treatise, Ausführliche theoretisch practische Anweisung zum Piano-Forte-Spiel, vom ersten Elementar-Unterrichte an, bis zur vollkommensten Ausbildung, 1828 (published in German, English, French, and Italian). Part Two discusses Hummel, the pedagogue; the impact on his star-students, notably Adolph Henselt, Ferdinand Hiller, and Sigismond Thalberg; his influence on musicians such as Chopin and Mendelssohn; and the spreading of his method throughout Europe and the US. Part Three deals with the precipitous decline of Hummel's reputation, particularly after severe attacks by Robert Schumann. His recent resurgence as a musician of note is exemplified in a case study of the changes in the appreciation of the Septet in D Minor, one of Hummel's most celebrated compositions. The Postlude assesses Hummel's role as a teacher by also addressing his ""hidden"" presence. For example, core elements of his method inform the pedagogy of Isabelle Vengarova, a teacher of Samuel Barber and Leonard Bernstein. Her piano instruction is indebted to Hummel, revealing the far-reaching influence of his pedagogical legacy. The appendices address important aspects, for example, Hummel's indirect impact in the US through Charles Zeuner.    Hummel's pedagogical legacy is divulged here in its significance of impact. Renewed interest is needed in a musician of eminence who suffered much bias and neglect and deserves a full reevaluation.",0
Les effets d'un programme d'entraînement musical expérimental sur l'appropriation du langage écrit à la maternelle,"This research examines the effect of an experimental music training program on the development of phonological awareness, word recognition and invented spelling abilities among 104 French Canadian kindergarten children without learning problems. The three experimental classes (N=51) have participated in a music training program adapted from Standley and Hughes' program (1997), while the three control classes (N=53) took part in the ministère de l'Éducation du Quebec music program (2001). The analysis of our data shows that both music training programs contribute similarly to the development of melodic and rhythmic perceptive abilities. However, at the level of emerging literacy abilities, the experimental music training program is more effective. In conclusion, we believe that auditory perception, phonological memory and metacognitive abilities play an essential role in the development of musical and linguistic abilities.",1
Multimodal dynamics: Self -supervised learning in perceptual and motor systems,"This thesis presents a self-supervised framework for perceptual and motor learning based upon correlations in different sensory modalities. The brain and cognitive sciences have gathered an enormous body of neurological and phenomenological evidence in the past half century demonstrating the extraordinary degree of interaction between sensory modalities during the course of ordinary perception. We develop a framework for creating artificial perceptual systems that draws on these findings, where the primary architectural motif is the cross-modal transmission of perceptual information to enhance each sensory channel individually. We present self-supervised algorithms for learning perceptual grounding, intersensory influence, and sensory-motor coordination, which derive training signals from internal cross-modal correlations rather than from external supervision. Our goal is to create systems that develop by interacting with the world around them, inspired by development in animals.    We demonstrate this framework with: (1) a system that learns the number and structure of vowels in American English by simultaneously watching and listening to someone speak. The system then cross-modally clusters the correlated auditory and visual data. It has no advance linguistic knowledge and receives no information outside of its sensory channels. This work is the first unsupervised acquisition of phonetic structure of which we are aware, outside of that done by human infants. (2) a system that learns to sing like a zebra finch, following the developmental stages of a juvenile zebra finch. It first learns the song of an adult male and then listens to its own initially nascent attempts at mimicry through an articulatory synthesizer. In acquiring the birdsong to which it was initially exposed, this system demonstrates self-supervised sensorimotor learning. It also demonstrates afferent and efferent equivalence---the system learns motor maps with the same computational framework used for learning sensory maps.

"Musical abilities in middle childhood: intra-personal, social and temporal contexts.","The aim of this research was to examine relationships between musical abilities and general intelligence, initially using Gardner’s (1983) theory of multiple intelligences, which contend that they are separate.  The intra-personal and social contexts of musical ability were then investigated to clarify whether immediate contacts operated distinctly from those in wider contexts.  Finally, using Dickens and Flynn’s (2001) theory of intelligence, the temporal context of musical ability was examined o see if musical abilities can be self-enhancing.  The research sites used were nine schools in England and Wales, representative of different social strata and musical specialisation, including state primary, choir and independent schools, from which 433 pupils, aged 7-11 (middle childhood) took part.  Measures used were the Bentley (1966a) Measures of Musical Ability, Heim and Simmonds’ (1974) Group Tests of General Reasoning, National Foundation for Educational Research Tests in English and Mathematics (1994a, 1994b) and Bellin and Rees’ (2004) adaptation of Harter’s (1988) self-perception scales for self-concept.  A musical experience questionnaire was also devised.       It was found that musical ability and general intelligence are not separate intelligences in the way that Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory would suggest.  The closeness of the relationship between musical ability and general intelligence justified applying notions from Dickens and Flynn’s (2001) theory of intelligence to musical ability.  Relationships between musical abilities and self-concept concerned the sense of academic competence in non-specialist as well as specialist schools.  Historic changes such as music in the curriculum seem to have boosted musical abilities in middle childhood in state, specialist and independent schools.  The most powerful influence appeared to be learning to play a musical instrument.  However, contrary to assumptions of multiplying effects of social influences, musical abilities do not appear to be self enhancing.",0
Acculturation and the use of media among Arab women immigrants living in Metropolitan Detroit,"This acculturation study examined the role of media among a sample of Arab women immigrants living in Metropolitan Detroit, home to the highest concentration of Arabic-speaking communities in the United States. This inquiry used a communication perspective with in-depth interviews among 30 homemakers, working women, and students, ages 19-55, from seven Arab countries for two purposes: (a) to reveal the particular media these women are watching, listening to, and reading and (b) to explore the role of U.S. and Arabic media in the acculturation process. The results indicated that U.S. television was the main medium assisting women to learn English and U.S. culture. Overall, U.S. television programming aided the acculturation process in acquiring English, becoming knowledgeable about U.S. culture, in learning what was culturally suitable, hearing about U.S. laws, teaching their children English, and staying abreast of current events in their homelands and in the United States. Having access to Arabic satellite television was very important to nearly all of the women and has contributed to a perceived shift away from U.S. television. Women watched Arabic television to remain in contact with their native culture, stay informed with current events, for companionship, and for entertainment. The Internet was significantly incorporated into the daily lives of the students and most of the working women. The students were primarily using the Internet to find information and to connect with their own culture back home with e-mail, chatting, listening to music, and reading news. Working women used the Internet for information-seeking activities and correspondence. Radio, CDs, and print media played minor roles in the women's lives. Arabic media available by satellite was utilized more often than local Arabic media choices on cable television, radio, or print. A key finding and contribution to acculturation research was exploring the diversity of media sources selected. This integration of media reinforced the active audience concept and was demonstrated by the dynamic interplay of both U.S. and Arabic media in the women's daily lives. The acculturation strategies of segregation versus integration were also revealed in the lives of some of the women studied.",0
The incest ballad of “Delgadina”: Oral tradition from medieval Spain to Latin America,"My approach to the Romancero, the Pan-Hispanic ballad tradition, crosses the boundary between medieval Iberia and modern Latin America and bridges the gap between national, chronological, and geographic divisions. The reasons for the Romancero's continued existence become readily apparent when it is examined in relation to the individuals who have preserved and molded its very character. In this way, we can better see the vital role that individual singers---particularly women---have played in the continuity of the tradition. As oral texts, many of the romances celebrate the power of female speech to subvert and transgress, while the singers themselves typically continue to conform to these cultural paradigms. The Romancero's oral form makes it an excellent medium for discussing women's roles, both within and outside the text, and for demonstrating that female voices can speak to us on a variety of levels.    My study focuses on Delgadina, a father-daughter incest ballad of medieval origin that still survives in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking worlds, and has many variants and cognates, including folktales, legends, and the romance of Silvana. At first glance, a ballad such as Delgadina seems to portray women as victims of male hegemony. Yet the poem can also be viewed as a way for women singers to express the power they may be denied in their own lives. The ballad's continued existence is a testimony to the power of oral narrative as a tool of affirmation for subaltern subjects.    In the second part of my study, I examine how Delgadina adapts and survives in various Latin American contexts, particularly in Cuba and in Mexico. During fieldwork conducted in Cuba, I found that Hispanic ballads often co-exist as both romances sung by adults and as children's songs. In Mexico, Delgadina was adapted as a popular  corrido (a Mexican and Mexican-American ballad) and became a part of Mexican folklore and popular imagination. The continued existence of  Delgadina in oral tradition not only reveals people's ongoing fascination and horror with the incest taboo, but also embodies the highly ambiguous and problematic status of the female speaking subject.",0
General educators' perceptions about the overrepresentation of elementary -aged black males identified as students with emotional disturbance,"For over three decades both advocates and educators have been interested in the overrepresentation of black males in special education (National Academy of Science, 2002; Losen & Orfield, 2002; Hilliard, 1990; 1995; 2001; National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 1994; 1995; Patton, 1998; Dunn, 1968; Deno, 1970; Artiles & Trent, 1994). Black males are one and a half times more likely to be labeled as emotionally disturbed (ED) than other non-black students and are placed in special needs programs more frequently than their peers, both male and female (Coutinho & Oswald, 1998; Harry, 1994). National efforts to change this condition have fallen short of success (Coutinho & Oswald, 1998; MacMillan & Reschly, 1998; Oswald, Coutinho, Best & Singh, 2002; 1999; Chinn & Hughes, 1987; Brady, Manni & Losen & Orfield (2002), 1983). Consequently, the overrepresentation and inappropriate placement of black males is cause for public concern at a time when the American student demographic itself is changing. Unfortunately, public concern remains that although America's student body is becoming more and more diverse, children who are nonwhite, non-native-English-speaking, or poor continue to be overidentified as having disabilities and to be served in more segregated placements than their peers (Coutinho & Oswald, 1998; Artiles & Trent, 1994).    The purpose of this study was to survey general educators about their perceptions of factors affecting the overrepresentation of elementary aged black males in classrooms for students with emotional disturbance (ED). The subjects for this study were 158 elementary school general education teachers. In this descriptive study a 34-item questionnaire was developed to determine general educators' perceptions about causal factors for the overrepresentation of elementary aged black males identified as ED. The instrument was created, pilot tested and validated. The survey was then administered in a Maryland public school system to general education elementary school teachers. The data were collected, coded, analyzed and discussed. The results of this study showed that while general education teachers considered environmental, teacher perception and school related variables to be influential to the overrepresentation of black males in ED classrooms, environmental factors were most frequently noted as being causal in nature for black students being identified as ED. The results of this study also produced interesting conclusions about the five independent variables that were studied. These were gender, ethnicity, training to identify students for special education services, training to identify ED characteristics and years of experience as an elementary school general education teacher. Of these independent variables, the ethnicity of respondents to the survey helped to contribute to more statistically significant differences in responses than all other variables combined. This indicates that overrepresentation research and policy changes should consider both the influence of environmental factors on ED identification rates and the power that ethnicity has on teacher perceptions.",0
Part One. The integrity of structure or the structure of integrity: An analysis of Charles Ives' “Hallowe'en”. Part Two. Concerto for Piano and Chamber Ensemble,"Part one. “The Integrity of Structure or the Structure of Integrity: An Analysis of Charles Ives' Hallowe'en” examines the compositional procedures employed by Charles Ives in Hallowe'en. Charles Ives described Hallowe'en as “one of the most carefully worked out (technically speaking), and one of the best pieces (from the standpoint of workmanship)” that he had ever done. First, what is the structure of Hallowe'en? Second, is this structure a thoroughly worked out and closed structure? If an analysis reveals that this is not the case, what could Ives have meant with his assertion about the structural integrity of Hallowe'en?    A case can be made for the validity of two contradictory interpretations regarding the structural integrity of Hallowe'en. On one hand musical analysis clearly contradicts Ives' claim by showing that there is a breakdown in the integrity of the compositional processes he initiates, for example, a canon. On the other hand analysis confirms Ives' statement by showing that, rather than carrying such processes to their logical conclusions, the goal was for these systems to completely breakdown and therefore act as a musical metaphor for the stated program, a children's Halloween party.    Part two. Concerto for Piano and Chamber Ensemble  is an original music composition scored for flute, oboe/english horn, clarinet, bassoon, 2 French horns, 3 multi-percussionists, 2 harps, piano, 2 violins, viola, cello and bass. This music explores aesthetic issues raised in Part One concerning the use of formalized compositional processes.",0
Investigating perceptions of third-grade teachers on standards implementation design and Hawaii Content and Performance Standards II,"Hawaii's education system has undergone a continuous restructuring and reform effort. In 1994, the Hawaii Commission on Performance Standards was created by the Hawaii Legislature through Act 334. The Standards Implementation Design (SID) was conceived in the contact of this mandate in January 1999 creating a new reform that promises to bring the education system in Hawaii to a higher level of standards for all students in ten content areas of the Hawaii Content and Performance Standards II (HCPS II). A little over a year later, Hawaii Legislature passed Senate Bill 2837, now known as Act 238, that was singed into law in July 2000. The intent was to increase accountability, authority, and flexibility within the public school system. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions held by third grade teachers on SID and HCPS II in the area of teachers' knowledge of SID and HCPS II concepts, teacher preparation on setting higher standards in the classroom, and teachers' implementation of reform strategies in the classroom as it relates to their school's reform effort to establish new high standards for students achievement. The secondary purpose of this study was to investigate teachers' years of experience as it relates to their confidence level to set higher standards in the classroom, how teachers judged the different resources available to assist in setting higher standards in the classroom, how teachers perceived professional development programs, and how teachers set the standards for students with limited English proficiency and students with disabilities. The survey was designed after the United States Department of Education “Status of Education Reform in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools: Teachers' Perspectives Survey” distributed nationwide in 1996 with approval given for this study to alter and distribute the survey. This research methodology concludes with a statistical analyses of the survey results.",0
Creating common ground: Enhancing elementary education for all learners through the use of puppetry,"The purpose of this research project was to demonstrate that interdisciplinary lessons, combining music or visual art with other subject areas, serve to assist all types of learners by creating a comfortable environment, presenting a new perspective, and reinforcing skills in an enjoyable manner. The study included all students in the fifth grade of a suburban elementary school. In their language arts classes, students had been learning to identify and properly use parts of speech. After completing the language arts unit, students participated in a musical puppet play, presenting the same concepts in music class.    Through a pre-test and post-test, the study measured changes or growth in understanding for all students and also compared the changes among students specifically classified with various learning disabilities, students for whom English is a second language, and students in high, average, and low level reading groups. The study also surveyed the students' learning styles and analyzed the results for the different groups of personal learning preferences. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",0
"From sound to symbol: The whole song as curriculum, the whole child as pedagogue, observation as methodology","‘There is more to a song than meets the ear’ to paraphrase an old adage. This ‘more’ refers particularly to certain songs in which the acoustic properties of the music move in confluence with spoken English. This ‘more’ refers to a particular process through which children learn songs, and once learned engage with them as objects of thought and represent them in symbol. This ‘more’ refers to particular songs as events aptly suited to circumscribe the temporal/spatial, perceptual/motor, emotional/social, imaginative/cognitive engagement of children-as-learners.    The dissertation is a narrative in which the author traces the story of her transformation from being a successful symbol-to-sound music teacher, to becoming a sound-to-symbol educator of children and the teachers of children.",0
Orff-schulwerk applications in greek settings,"This research studies the applicability of the Orff-Schulwerk principles to Greek culture.  Orff-SchulwerkYa well known creative music and movement teaching approach which strongly supports the use of folk musicYmeets a worldwide popularity among primary schools and kindergarten syllabuses.       Through a qualitative approach, the reason focuses on issues that emerged from an extensive literature review.  Data were collected through observations of Orff-Schulwerk classes at the Orff-Institute in Salzburg and in three Orff classes in Athens; through interviewing eminent Orff teachers both in Salzburg and in Athens; and the examination of transcriptions of Orff-Schulwerk practices both in Salzburg and in Athens.       Generally speaking, the findings from the observations and interviews indicate that some aspects of the Greek Orff-Schulwerk's adaptation, such as the nature of Greek language and Greek traditional music, which would form the basic Orff-Schulwerk teaching material in Greece, have not been studied adequately.       The study recommends a fundamental re-examination of the teaching material which must derive from the special cultural idiom of each district of Greece; a review of  movement activities in the light of the nature of folk dances; an enrichment of the Orff instrumentarium with folk instruments; an exploration of the potential for creativity through improvisational activities involving all the above new teaching material.  All these changes will eventually lead into freeing Greek Orff teachers form reproducing the German model of Orff-Schulwerk.",0
"Rasta, race and revolution: the emergence and development of the rastafari movement in socialist cuba","Since its inception in the 1930s, the Jamaican Rastafari movement has gained a widespread local and international following.  Today Rastafari communities and dreadlocked inspired youth can be found throughout the Caribbean, parts of Central America and Brazil, North America, Europe and much of Africa as well as among the Maoris in New Zealand, some Native American groups in the US and many Japanese youth.  Given its humble beginnings in the slums of West Kingston and the unfriendly climate and oppressive forces in which Rastafari was born and against which it continues to struggle, this growth and international exposure is truly remarkable.  The primary catalyst and medium through which the movement has been globally spread has been reggae music.  Through this process of internationalisation, Rastafari has lost its original territorial moorings and become a travelling culture (Clifford, 1992).  However, although one can speak of the globalisation of Rastafari, one cannot speak of a monolithic, homogeneous or bounded Rastafari culture.  Instead, Rastafari is continuously being appropriated and reinterpreted by different peoples in different ways, which has resulted in the emergence of new localised expressions of the movement.      Although mainly found in English speaking and capitalist countries the movement has also emerged and developed in socialist and Spanish speaking Cuba.  How Rastafari has entered the island, why and by whom it has been taken on as well as how it manifests itself locally is the focus of this thesis.  In particular it looks at how Cubans have adopted and adapted the movement to their own context and individual circumstances and how in this process a myriad of new, cubanised Rasta expressions have emerged.      Although there are a multiple of ways in which people identify themselves with and express Rastafari, the culture in Cuba is predominantly an Afro-Cuban youth movement.  The reasons, significance and potential implications of this have a lot to do with Cuba's current economic crisis and the intense social transformations this is causing.",0
Jonathan and David: An opera in one act,"The Biblical story of Jonathan and David as told in 1 and 2 Samuel provides the source material of an original composition for voices and symphony orchestra. Staged simply and sung from beginning to end, “Jonathan and David” is a hybrid between opera and oratorio and serves as a companion piece for “Apollo and Hyacinth,” a one-act ballet written and premiered in 1998.    “Jonathan and David” is scored for string orchestra, harp, piano, flute doubling piccolo, oboe doubling English horn, two B-flat clarinets, one of which doubles bass clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, two horns in F, trombone, timpani, two percussion, five principal singers and chorus. The cast consists of Jonathan, son of Saul (lyric baritone); David, the future King of Israel (lyric tenor); Saul, the first appointed King of Israel (dramatic tenor); Samuel, the last Judge and first Prophet of Israel (bass-baritone); and Yahweh, the God of Israel (mezzo-soprano).    The musical vocabulary in “Jonathan and David” is tonal and melodic. The vocal style of the work is bel canto. The singers must also be actors who convey the drama of the story through minimal stage movement. The visual aspects of the presentation are to be secondary to the auditory experience of the work. Space permitting, the orchestra should sit on stage behind the vocalists.    Loosely based on scripture, the libretto for “Jonathan and David” focuses on the covenant made between the two title characters. King Saul's madness provides dramatic tension. David is brought to Saul's house to play music that will calm the King and by doing so, he wins the heart of Jonathan. Saul fears that David aspires to replace him as King and he tries to kill the young shepherd. Before David flees, he and Jonathan pledge their love to one another. King Saul and Jonathan die in battle. David and the people of Israel are grief-stricken and sing a lamentation for their fallen King and his son.",0
"A performer's analysis of Lili Boulanger's “Clairières dans le ciel”: Song cycle for high voice and piano, a lecture recital, together with the role of Blanche in “Dialogues of the Carmelites” by F. Poulenc and two recitals of selected works by H. Purcell, F. Schubert, S. Prokofieff, E. Chausson, W. A. Mozart, R. Schumann and G. Fauré","Lili Boulanger was an important composer of early twentieth century French music. Her compositional style represents a development and mastery of musical techniques of the great composers of her time including Faure, Debussy and Wagner combined with her own creative expression. The result is a compelling musical language that was uniquely her own. She held an important place among her contemporaries in Paris and her accomplishments were considered newsworthy during her lifetime (1893–1918). She obtained a much sought-after publishing contract with Ricordi. Her more famous sister, Nadia Boulanger, felt that Lili was the better composer of the two, and her peers and music professors clearly felt that both her musical and personal qualities were extraordinary. Evidence of her intelligence, creativity, and artistic growth can be seen in her music.    As the first woman to win the Prix de Rome (July 5, 1913), Lili Boulanger, unlike Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn, or Alma Mahler, was acknowledged and acclaimed during her lifetime for her skill as a composer. Yet, nearly a century later the music of this talented French composer is not as well known as it deserves to be. In an effort to discover the reasons for this relative anonymity, this document will examine Lili Boulanger's life including her family and childhood influences, musical training, preparation for the Prix de Rome and the influence of Claude Debussy and other composers. This document will discuss her mature compositional style, specifically as it is reflected in her song cycle, Clairières dans le ciel. The text will be examined in conjunction with the literary movement of symbolism in 20th century France and the symbolist poet, Francis Jammes, with special attention to the composer's personal identification with the poetry. Considerations of the musical setting of the cycle will include the melodic style as it relates to the text, the harmonic idiom and its relation to the poetry, rhythmic and metrical devices used, formal devices and the relationship of the piano accompaniment and the voice. Performance considerations for this cycle include the recommended transpositions if performed by soprano rather than the tenor voice for which it was originally composed and the level of difficulty from an interpretative as well as technical standpoint.",0
Latin American women composers for cello or chamber music which includes the cello,"From the first days of the conquest of New Spain, Hispanic conquerors intermarried with native women who had been indoctrinated into a culture rich with music. The mestizo children of these marriages, along with subsequent European immigrants and slaves who came from Africa formed the basis of an amalgamated musical culture which evolved through the Colonial and Revolutionary periods to modern Latin America. Europeans introduced bowed stringed instruments into a culture which had been proliferated by winds and percussion.    In Mexico, nuns and other religious women attained a remarkable degree of proficiency in music as is evidenced by the writings of Sor Inés de la Cruz (1648/51–1695), and the Christmas cantatas of Maria Joachina Rodrigues (ca. 1688, Puebla) and Lupe Ortiz (fl. 1692, Oaxaca) which include basso continuo. Colonial Latin America, while supporting church music, saw a transition from liturgical performance and instruction, to popular support of opera and salon concerts in the 18th and 19th centuries. In major cultural centers, prominent cellists came to the fore, exposing the instrument both soloistically and in chamber ensembles. In the later 19th century, orchestras, music societies and music schools blossomed as Nationalistic sentiments increasingly led to a search for distinctive musical styles within each country. Concurrently, women gained entrance into the professional sphere. Innovative women of the 19th century who contributed to the cello literature include Brazilian Chiquinha Gonzaga (1847–1935), Cuban Cecilia Arizti (1856–1930) and Venezuelan Teresa Carreño (1853–1917), whose String Quartet in B Minor is presented with analysis as exemplary.    In the first decades of the 20th century, many women began to compose brilliantly for the instrument. In the Appendix, more than 400 compositions by some 130 women are documented with instrumentation and source references. Some specific works are briefly profiled based on score study or secondary source references. Twentieth century works chosen for detailed analysis include Brazilian Kilza Setti's (b. 1932) Quatro Canções  for soprano and string quartet, Puerto Rican Esther Alejandro's (b. 1947) Cuatro Reflexiones for solo cello and Argentine Alicia Terzian's (b. 1934) Tres Piezas, Op. 5 for string quartet.",0
Germaine Tailleferre (1892-1983): Piano and chamber works,"Germaine Tailleferre was the only female member of Les Six, the group of French composers prominent in Paris in the early 1920s. She wrote more than 300 compositions in nearly every possible genre: songs, chamber music, orchestral music, piano solos, concertos, chamber operas, and scores for ballets, films, and television. Against the wishes of her father, she entered the Paris Conservatoire at age twelve, eventually winning more prizes than any of Les Six. Tailleferre's music fit the prevailing neoclassical spirit, tempered with her gifts for lyricism and imaginative harmony.    Chapter One is a biography of Tailleferre based upon her memoirs, correspondence, interviews, and other secondary sources. The remaining chapters are a comprehensive look at the significant body of Tailleferre's music: her works for piano and her chamber music. Chapter Two contains information and analyses of solo piano pieces and works for two pianos. Chapter Three discusses significant works for piano and orchestra. In Chapter Four Tailleferre's important contributions to the chamber music literature are analyzed, including her String Quartet, her Image, her violin sonatas, and her Piano Trio of 1978. The final chapter addresses miscellaneous scores which were first composed in two-piano form, including La nouvelle Cythère, a ballet commissioned by Diaghilev but never mounted. This study contains seventy-six musical excerpts, including several from unpublished manuscripts.    Tailleferre clung to specific characteristics, such as classical forms and a tonal harmonic language, yet she addressed each composition imaginatively. After 1930 she became increasingly bold in her orchestration, harmonic vocabulary, and use of large forms. Many works began life as a two-piano score, and self-borrowing was an important facet of Tailleferre's compositional evolution. Works discussed and illustrated, such as her Ballade pour piano et orchestre and Piano Concerto No. 1 of the twenties, her violin sonatas (twenties and forties), her Concerto pour deux pianos, choeurs mixtes, saxophones, el orchestre of the thirties, and her Partita for two pianos and percussion (1964) compare favorably to the finest works of any of Les Six. This study illuminates a richness of material which demands further study and provides attractive performance possibilities.",0
Pitch perception: an investigation of its development with special reference to factors involved in absolute pitch.,"This investigation of pitch perception consisted of 4 studies and surveyed 390 subjects (299 children and 91 adults), ranging in age from 5 to 70 years.Cases studied included the visually impaired as well as the normally sighted, professional musicians as well as the musically naive, groups from early and middle childhood as well as adolescents and adults, females as well as males.A specially designed test of pitch naming, using both pure and piano tones, was administered to 204 subjects.Those who had learned to play an instrument before learning to read music were found to be much better at Absolute Pitch (AP) perception than were those who had learned both skills concurrently; than those who had only learned to play an instrument; and those who were musically naive in both respects (p<.001 in each case).The earlier a child commenced instrumental instruction, the better was his/her score in Absolute Pitch perception.In a separate study Bentley's Musical Ability Test and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were administered to 5-to 6-year old and 12-year-old age groups (N=115).  This revealed cross-cultural (English versus Irish) differences in Relative Pitch perception (as well as in other aspects of musical ability).The 5-to 6-year-olds of the Galway normative sample did better at pitch discrimination than the 7-year-olds of Bentley's English sample (p<.001).  The Galway 12-year-olds also surpassed their English coevals (.01>p>.001).Among other things, this study has examined, arguably for the first time:(i) the degree to which Absolute Pitch perception, in the form of pitch naming, exists within the child population;(ii)  the effect on pitch perception, particularly on Absolute Pitch perception, of learning to read music notation.The findings appear to have important implications for musical pedagogy.",0
An ethnography of secondary school student composition in music: A study of personal involvement within the compositional process,"This study deals primarily with the way secondary-school students use music to express their personal, inner feelings through composition. Because the topic of personal expression through music composition is an elusive one, my methodology borrows and combines analytical tools from the fields of phenomenology, hermeneutics, semiotics, ethnography and English language arts, and incorporates these tools in the exploration of student's processes of self-expression through music composition.    For a period of several weeks I worked with a sixteen-student sample group in a Vancouver high school. Each of the students handed in a musical composition. Four of the students granted me interviews in which they shared their views of their compositional processes and the resulting musical works.    By the conclusion of the study, the students had displayed the ability to communicate certain ideas, images and emotions, and express themselves by articulating their own unique sense of being through their musical compositions. Furthermore, the students demonstrated a level of musical awareness which has very little to do with the type of proficiency-based music learning that is prevalent in many of today's music education classrooms. Most importantly, however, this study spawns a methodology which examines students' compositional processes rather than their finished musical products.",0
Unsolving history: The past as enigma in contemporary British fiction,"My dissertation identifies the mystification of history as a major trend in contemporary British fiction, including John Fowles' A Maggot, Martin Amis' Time's Arrow, Peter Ackroyd's English Music, Desmond MacNamara's The Book of Intrusions, Jeanette Winterson's Sexing the Cherry, and Angela Carter's Wise Children. Treating novels published mainly within the past decade, this project challenges the reigning assumption that postmodern historiographic novels share a uniformly subversive post-structuralist agenda. I argue that these novels depict irrational historical forces as they advance conflicting, often opposing visions of tradition, national identity, and gender roles. In my argument, I have three over-arching aims: to suggest the ideological diversity of postmodern fiction that has moved beyond a deconstructive phase; to chart the emergence of mystification as a tactic to center categories of identity, whether from the perspective of the conservative English male or a liberal lesbian-feminist; and to provide a vocabulary for discussing the positions of agency these novels imagine for characters and model for readers.    I contend that a deconstructive approach--anticipated by William Spanos and developed by Linda Hutcheon--is suited to earlier works such as Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman and D. M. Thomas' The White Hotel. These novels challenge a traditional, positivist model of historiography that inscribes the referent in a cause-effect sequence and grounds its claim for legitimacy on a progressive narrative. I argue that while continuing to dismantle this model of history, more recent novels actively mystify their relation to the past: they posit forces that cannot by understood or controlled through traditional cause-effect driven narratives. Far from reflecting a uniformly subversive project, Amis, MacNamara, and others use the reaction of characters to this enigmatic past to construct models of response, and encourage readers to adopt particular positions of agency or identity. In advancing these claims, I explore the work of novelists who challenge a tradition of dissent based on the individual (Fowles and Amis), who reconceive connections between national identity and a literary canon (Ackroyd and MacNamara), and who critique oppressive gender roles by historicizing notions of sexual difference (Winterson and Carter).",0
A conductor's performance guide to the Stuart masque,"The masque was an aristocratic court entertainment that developed in England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Its primary function was to entertain nobles for special state affairs. The masque, a forerunner of the ""masked ball,"" incorporated dance, music, spoken dialogue, mythological and allegorical themes, comedy, drama, poetry, costumes, and elaborate sets into a visual spectacle. These masques could be considered the early prototypes of today's musical theater and opera. It is from these masque's extant music and prose that this treatise is based.    The need for the dissertation arose when it was found that there was no masque partsong literature commercially available for vocal ensembles or a performance guide to the genre. The music that was found, existed in large collected volumes, not commercially available for vocal ensembles.    The purpose of this treatise is to provide choral conductors and early music directors with a practical and comprehensive performance guide to the Stuart masque. Through this performance guide, conductors would be able to develop contemporary ""interpretive adaptations"" within their own context. The treatise will accomplish these goals by presenting the following chapters: Historical Perspective of the Masque; Dance in the Masque; Stage and Costuming for the Masque; Instrumental Accompaniment Issues; Vocal Considerations; and an in-depth analysis and comparison of three representative English masques from various stages during the Stuart period. In addition to the musical arrangements, the appendices will present diverse resource material to assist one in staging a masque.",0
Family support: An investigation of services preferred by families of young children enrolled in child-care centers,"This research examined differences in preferred services of child-care centers by families who were experiencing various levels of stress (high, moderate, or low) and whose families included young children. The sample of 136 volunteer families had at least one preschool-age child enrolled full-time in a child-care laboratory at a community college or university in North Texas. Two types of services, Assisting and Convenience, were evaluated. Assisting Services, which may or may not be located at the child-care center, provide aid or help to families. Convenience Services are time-savers that are available at the center.    Two instruments developed by the researcher, The Family Support Services Survey elicited preferred services, and The Family Information Sheet provided a description of the sample. The Family Inventory of Life Events and Change, a self-report questionnaire, determined family life changes within the past 12 months. Out of 238 packets distributed to 5 sites, 136 (57%) participants completed and returned requested forms.    Two hypotheses were tested by an one-way analysis of variance to examine differences between preferred types of Assisting and Convenience Services among three stress groups. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and preferred services.    Results suggested that Assisting Services would be ""helpful"" to all three stress groups. Significant differences were determined among the three stress groups for Convenience Services. A post hoc test indicated Convenience Services were considered to be ""helpful"" by the high- and moderate-stress groups. The low-stress group designated ""undecided.""    Preferred Assisting Services were Parents Open House, a nurse at the Center, health issues, community service referrals, child development assessments, and sliding fee scale. Convenience Services' preferences included Additional Classes for Children: music, art, computer, gymnastics, and Spanish lessons; and Classes for Adults: parent skills workshops, stress management, financial planning, aerobics, and Spanish lessons. Other preferred Convenience Services pertained to a Center-located lending library, Parent's Night Out, children's clothes exchange CoOp, and immunizations.",0
"An investigation of the current practices and problems associated with recruiting, teaching, and retaining Hispanic students in selected middle school band programs in Southern California","The purpose of the study was to investigate the factors relating to the motivation, recruitment, retention, and instructional methods employed to teach Hispanic students in four selected middle school band programs in Southern California. Based on the data gathered from the teacher interviews and the student questionnaire, specific recommendations were made so that music educators may successfully recruit, instruct and maintain Hispanic students in middle school band programs. Additional recommendations were made for future development of instructional materials and beginning band method books.    There are numerous studies in the areas of second language acquisition and biliteracy which indicate the importance of using culturally relevant materials in the instruction of children from ethnic minority and immigrant families. This study specifically addresses cultural relevance and the other issues involved in the instrumental music education of Hispanic students in public school bands.    Band directors from selected middle schools in Southern California were interviewed in an attempt to discover answers to the proposed research questions. Questionnaires were also administered to the student participants at each of the sample schools. The findings of the study are drawn from the responses to the Teacher Interview Guide, along with the information supplied on the Student Questionnaires. Those findings are reported and discussed within the framework of the research questions.    Based on the data gathered in this study, several recommendations are offered: (1) develop new beginning band method books and culturally relevant, authentic Hispanic song collections for use in beginning band classes which will allow teaches to better meet the needs of our growing Hispanic school populations; (2) revise and supplement current beginning band methods and materials to reflect the cultural heritage of minority populations; (3) develop concert band arrangements for young bands which make use of traditional Hispanic folk melodies and rhythms; (4) encourage teachers to seek further training which will help them to better understand the methods of bilingual, multicultural, and sheltered English instruction; (5) provide performance opportunities;s for middle school students using traditional ethnic percussion instruments in band classes; (6) develop video-taped clinics featuring Hispanic performers who can serve as role models for young students.",0
"The vihuela fantasias from Miguel de Fuenllana's ""Orphenica Lyra"": Introduction and guitar transcription of nine representative works","Miguel de Fuenllana, the Spanish composer and vihuelist, published Orphenica Lyra in 1554. Comprised mainly of vocal intabulations (sacred and secular, European and Spanish), the work also features fifty-one original fantasias; these pieces demonstrate both Fuenllana's polyphonic skill and instrumental virtuosity.    This study is an introduction to the fantasias of Fuenllana. In Chapter One, literature related to the study is reviewed. While few studies have been devoted specifically to Fuenllana, many sources contain pertinent information, especially the modern edition of Orphenica Lyra by Charles Jacobs, and John Ward's dissertation on the vihuela. Several primary sources contribute valuable information, notably Juan Bermudo's Declaracion de instrumentos musicales (1555), and Thomas de Sancta Maria's Arte de taner fantasia (1565).    Chapter Two provides documentation regarding the composer, his publication, and the vihuela. Issues related to the transcription of tablature are addressed; the present transcriptions, for the modern guitar tuned from E, incorporate a 2:1 reduction. No barlines or meter signatures are used. Chapter Three discusses the fantasias; general compositional traits are noted, and specific works, representative of various formal types or compositional procedures, are analyzed. His works are instrumentally derived but carefully crafted and approach in style the mid-sixteenth century vocal motet. They were written with both artistic and didactic intent, that of pleasing the ear and exercising the fingers.    Chapter Four surveys Fuenllana's preface and other primary sources for an understanding of how these works should be performed. Fuenllana advocated clear, elegant playing, and moderation with regard to tempo and the application of embellishment. These principles apply as well to performance on the modern guitar. Chapter Five presents guitar transcriptions of nine representative works, including fingerings and suggestions for embellishment. Fuenllana's fantasias are a valuable addition to the repertoire of the guitar, an instrument related historically and aesthetically to the sixteenth-century vihuela.",0
The effects of a choral voice building method on pitch matching skills in high school students,"This study was designed to measure whether significant improvement in pitch-matching skills is obtained as a result of group instruction in singing. The study was a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design. Forty-three high school students (post-mutational, ages thirteen to eighteen, with no formal training in singing), the majority of whom happened to be classified as Limited English Proficient (LEP), were selected at two different school sites. An author-designed Pitch Accuracy Measure (PAM) served as a pretest-posttest. The treatment administered to the experimental group was the Ehmann-Haasemann choral voice building method. The results of the study showed that the treatment had no significant effect on the experimental group due to the existence of a confounding variable that occurred prior to the pretest. This study concludes that further investigation into the problem should be made.",0
Contributions to a communication model motivated by phonic configuring,"This dissertation in General Linguistics develops a model of speech communication on the basis of eight previous articles. The themes of the articles are paralinguistics, the teaching of foreign languages, translation theory, segmental phonology, and language vs. music. The common point of departure for the articles and the model developed on the basis of them is provided by specific holistic features of speech. These determine pragmatic characteristics of linguistic utterances and direct their interpretation.    These features have traditionally been studied within prosodic phonology. Here, however, they are interpreted as communicative activities making it possible to understand the interlocutor himself, and not only an isolated utterance. I designate these primary activities, which are opposed to the purely verbal, as ""phonic configuring"" (German Klanggestaltung). An explanation of their nature is to be found in the metaphors of prosodic terminology. The main method used is hermeneutic concept analysis. This reveals the motives for conceptualizations of space and movement contained in this metaphorical apparatus.    The dissertation demonstrates that these metaphors share a common foundation with phonic configuring and gesticulation. This foundation is a psycho-processual spatiality which I designate as ""Q-space"" (""Q"" standing for ""Quasi"") and within which ""motion"" and ""emotion"" are identical. In this spatiality, the interlocutors reciprocally integrate their communicative activities. The integration is made possible by the common denominator of corporeality (Merleau-Ponty) which establishes a communicative field between the interlocutors, i.e. a remote effect or induction. This concept of induction has been adapted from the remote effect between electronic oscillatory circuits. Here, the initial communicative attitude is empathy, i.e. the unconscious intention to identify with the interlocutor on the corporeal and psychic planes.",0
"""Work to create the future you want"": Contemporary discourse in a Severn Ojibwe community","This research provides an empirically-based, synchronic overview of an Amerindian village in northern Ontario, Canada, currently undergoing rapid social change. Using a discourse-centered approach to ethnography, this study illustrates ways in which a society is indexed through its discourse, and how changes in society affect language use. It is both an ethnography of speaking and an ethnography through speaking. The primary data collected for this research were naturally-occurring discourses, most of which were presented by members of the Native community for the Native community itself.    The topics covered in the dissertation are diverse, ranging from communication technologies, to code switching between Ojibwe, Cree and English, to literacy in both Cree syllabics and standard English, to the intersection of language and music, and to a formal analysis of two narrative genres. These topics were selected as representative of the major linguistic forms found in the community--forms which are inextricably bound to the cultural context and social institutions of the Kingfisher Lake community.    Because of its unique brand of self-determinism, the Severn Ojibwe community of Kingfisher Lake stands as a model for other Native communities, demonstrating that cultural change and the adoption of modern technology need not mean that a people lose either their Native identity or their language. Rather, the people of Kingfisher Lake demonstrate a remarkable ability to integrate new ideas and technology into their Native lifestyles.",0
Elsie Janis: A compensatory biography,"In evaluating the early years of this century, theatre scholars tend to concentrate only on the personalities and productions which were significant in the evolution of today's theatre. Prominent early-nineteeth-century artists who belonged to the mainstream rather than to the vanguard, are often examined inadequately or ignored entirely. While many forgotten stars of this period are worthy of study, this paper examines the career of Elsie Janis.    Elsie Janis's forty-five years before the public--from 1896 to 1941--encompassed virtually all forms of popular entertainment. Her musical theatre career began with Victor Herbert and concluded with George Gershwin. Her vaudeville specialty--imitations of stage favorites--began with May Irwin and Julia Arthur and ended with Helen Hayes. Janis became one of the highest-paid and most famous vaudeville entertainers in the English- and French-speaking worlds. She was one of the first women to write, produce, and star in motion pictures, both silents and ""talkies""; was a bestselling writer, nationally syndicated columnist and cartoonist; was the first woman announcer on nation-wide radio; and, had been commissioned a general by John J. ""Blackjack"" Pershing for her World War I entertainments.    How Elsie Janis attained her enormous popularity, what characteristics she possessed as an entertainer, and what contributions she made to the theatre of her era and in the development of popular entertainment, are the focuses of this study.    Without slighting the numerous libraries consulted, this study was founded on eight scrapbooks, kept by Janis's mother, which contain thousands of reviews, articles, programmes, and letters detailing Janis's entire career. These materials are in the author's possession.",0
The relationship between experience in performing music class and critical thinking about music,"The possible existence of a dependent relationship between the number of years of performing music class experience and the development of critical thinking skill about music was explored. A sample of 279 high school juniors from three differing high schools in Wisconsin was studied. The value of the variable Years of Experience was gathered from subjects by a pre-test questionnaire. The variable Level of Critical Thinking was determined according to the ratings assigned to essays written by subjects in which they were asked to discuss, compare and evaluate two pre-recorded musical selections played for them.    Assigned essay ratings were composites of the individual ratings made by three independent readers according to the criteria of the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) Taxonomy. Content validity of the Taxonomy was defended in the literature review. Between judge reliability was calculated at.89. Within judge reliability was calculated as.62 for the thirty essays found most difficult to rate.    A significant value of the Chi-square statistic at the.05 level allowed for the rejection of the null hypothesis that there was no association between Years of Experience and Level of Critical Thinking. Measures of the strength of that relationship were quite low, however. Post Hoc comparisons indicated that at least six years of experience was required before a significant difference could be shown. Investigation of the relationship of Last Grade in English Class to both Experience and Level of Critical Thinking indicated a strong interaction-like effect of high levels of both Experience and English Grade on Level of Critical thinking.",0
An investigation of the practices of selected Manhattan-based corporations and private foundations in assessing the eligibility of performing arts groups for funding,"The decision-making practices of four corporations and six private foundations based in Manhattan were investigated for their methods of assessing the eligibility of performing arts groups for funding. A 21 item questionnaire and follow-up interviews with study respondents provided primary data and funding resource directories supplied secondary data.    A systematic analysis of the process by which corporations and private foundations evaluate the performing arts revealed: corporate and private foundation funders contradicted themselves on the criteria used for evaluating performing arts grant requests. They stated that they employed artistic merit as a criterion and that they assessed equally all nonprofit sector grant requests. Evidence indicated that they lacked requisite arts-expert personnel and ""sub-sets of criteria"" to judge artistic merit, which appeared to be a cosmetic mask for personal preferences. In the absence of artistic merit as a distinguishing evaluative criterion, performing arts grants were evaluated with the same criteria as those employed for every other nonprofit grant request. The arts were perceived to be less serious and substantive than other sectors and their evaluation was not considered to need the same discipline-based review required for the sciences. Corporate and private foundation funders, as well as artists and arts representatives, have evaluated performing arts grant requests for the National Endowment for the Arts. Unfortunately, no artists or arts representatives have served comparably as corporate or foundation participants.    The performing arts, dance, music, and theater, whose primary languages are those of movement, sound and gesture, are judged, as are all other grant applicants, first, and sometimes solely, on written materials.    The arts require a comprehensive plan to introduce communication skills integral to their survival. Courses in expository writing or writing for funding as a second language are needed by arts professionals who must become ""bi-lingual"" to compete effectively for subsidy in an overcrowded market. They need to speak and to understand the language of funders as well as of their art.",0
"The folk-games of children in Wales, 1860-1980","The primary purpose of this work is to put on record the games played by Welsh children during the period 1860-1980. Inherent in this design is the need to record the changes which have taken place during these years in the child's play tradition. The research covers a spectrum of play activities and these are classified into fourteen categories which are defined by particular play characteristics: Singing Games, Dialogue Games, Leader Games, Chasing Games, Rhythmic Games, Games of Chance, Teasing Activities, Parlour Games, Games of Physical Skill, Games Displaying Dexterity, Imitation Games, Games of Mischief, Seasonal Games, Improvised Toys and Play Objects. In general the research follows the pattern utilised by Brian Sutton-Smith in his pioneering investigation in the 1950's into children's games in New Zealand ('The Games of New Zealand Children' in The Folkgames of Children. Austin, Texas, The University of Texas Press, 1972, pp. 5-257). The most significant theme in the research describes the changes in the language of play over the period. The influence of external social factors on the Welsh child's oral tradition assumed an air of urgency in the latter half of the 19th century. By the end of the century they had enacted, as far as his singing games were concerned, an English language phenomenon. The role of language in this tradition was, and still is, particularly vulnerable to such extrinsic influences. The social, political and even economic implications of this particular oral tradition become apparent. Its utility, as seen in all Celtic countries, influencing the linguistic pattern was discernible partly as a consequence of the growth of comprehensive primary education in the 1860's and the 1870's.",0
THE STRING QUARTETS OF BERNARD VAN DIEREN (ENGLAND),"Bernard van Dieren (1887-1936) was born in Holland and moved to England in 1909. He studied violin as a child, but his basic education was in science. His works include several hundred songs, an opera, a symphony, orchestral chamber music, and six string quartets. Important European and British cultural figures such as Bliss, Busoni, Gray, Lambert, Moeran, Warlock (Philip Heseltine), and Walton considered van Dieren to be pre-eminent among English composers of the period between the two World Wars. Today his works are almost completely unknown.    Van Dieren's six string quartets were composed between the years 1912 and 1928. Critical analysis of these works support the thesis that van Dieren went through three relatively well defined stylistic periods.    As a young man, van Dieren attempted to master and then modernize the melodic contrapuntal idiom of the sixteenth century Italian madrigalists and the English Tudor composers. This early style is represented by the First Quartet and the first movement of the Second Quartet. Critics were hostile to this music, and van Dieren's reputation as a composer suffered irreparable damage.    In the remaining movements of the Second Quartet, and the Third, Fourth and Fifth Quartets, the composer was attracted to neo-classicism. Although these middle period works retain a mostly linear texture, harmonically they are tertian or triadic, are in familiar classic forms, are relatively easy to perform, and were more popular with critics and audiences than the early works.    Van Dieren achieved an important stylistic synthesis in the Sixth Quartet, which was his last major composition. The harmonic language is a skillful combination of atonal, chromatic, tertian and triadic effects, and the counterpoint is less complex than in the First and Second Quartets. This synthesis was a logical step in the evolution of the composer's style.    The six quartets of Bernard van Dieren are a significant, if somewhat uneven, contribution of the literature for string instruments. Both performers and audiences should find these works a welcome addition to the standard quartet repertoire.",0
"PLAYING WITH WORDS: THE VERBAL FOLKLORE OF PUERTO RICAN SCHOOLCHILDREN IN A MAINLAND SETTING (CULTURE, BILINGUAL, CHILDLORE, RHYMES, SPANISH, CONNECTICUT)","This study examined the ""Children's Verbal Folklore,"" or CVF, in Spanish and English, of 40 third- and fourth-grade Puerto Rican bilingual program students in New Haven, Connecticut. Researchers and teachers have paid little attention, for any group of children, to the content and uses of this type of material, which includes children's orally transmitted rhymes, sayings, and chants. This situation is unfortunate, since CVF has unique applications for improving students' self-esteem and first- and second-language skills, while laying a foundation for literacy.    One reason why CVF is a relatively untapped resource is that there is no established methodology for its collection and analysis. This study seeks to fill that gap. The method of data collection, hour-long individual interviews structured according to specific categories of children's verbal folklore, gives a framework for gathering data. The analysis comparing cultural themes in the collected CVF indicates how important insights can be gained from this seemingly childish and trivial material. The particular items of CVF which are presented illustrate directly what CVF is, and increase one's enthusiasm for this area of study through their wit and poetry.    By documenting 1,740 instances of subjects' awareness of verbal folkloric items, the investigation produced a preliminary main finding that CVF is alive and well among the children being studied. The study also yielded significant findings regarding the processes of transmission for CVF,and the roles of males and females, family, and friends as teachers and users of CVF. An ethnographic approach in analyzing the collected CVF, which allowed the material to speak for itself, rather than imposing preconceived limited and inflexible thematic categories, produced provocative insights regarding Puerto Rican and Anglo culture. Finally, CVF was examined as a tool used by adults and children for social problem-solving, emphasizing its role in shaping culture, as opposed to merely reflecting it.    The study's methodology provides a ""handle"" for anthropologists, ethnographers, and educators who wish to investigate children's folklore or use it in the classroom. The actual content of the study, however, adds to our understanding of Puerto Rican children on the mainland, by documenting and analyzing their verbal folklore.",0
LANGUAGE IN LEARNING: FROM RESEARCH INTO SECONDARY SCHOOL PRACTICE,"This study proceeded from the assumption that what is known about the linkage between language development and subject matter learning needs to be understood and implemented by secondary school teachers. The premises recommended by research in these areas over the past decade were defined for study purposes as (a) the integration in instruction of the language arts of reading, writing, speaking and listening; (b) the encouragement of the use of language by students to learn subject matter as well as to display formulated knowledge; and (c) the provision of frequent, sustained and varied occasions for students to use language for functional purposes. The study focused on the beliefs and practices of four secondary school teachers across a range of subject areas, grade levels and student backgrounds. Each had had some acquaintance with the language in learning research, and each had achieved exemplary teacher status within a large urban school district. Their practices provided instances of the ways research recommendations were or were not realized in particular classroom settings. Generally, the data affirm the contention that learning subject matter--whether music or chemistry or English--is a phenomenon related to language development. As expected, student purposes for using language showed themselves to be strong determinants of language quality. When students wrote or talked in order to be understood, they used language that was clear, substantive, and , at times, eloquent. When students expected to be judged by the pattern of their language, however, they produced not only formulaic, sometimes nonsensical language but also poorly patterned, often nonstandard language. Across the student ability range, the situation conducive not only to subject matter learning but also to the use of language in the standard English patterns valued by society was the consultative one, wherein students engaged in sustained exchanges about subject ideas. The instructional focus on the use of language to display formulated knowledge showed itself to be a practice which rewarded premature and only apparent achievement, the struggle with ideas foreshortened. in summary, the study showed that the teaching practices recommended by research in language and learning result in high student achievement. The study also documented the results of practices which persist despite research consensus, chiefly, the instructional focus on pattern perfection, the very emphasis which enfeebled even the honors student.",0
WALT WHITMAN'S LANGUAGE AND STYLE,"A study of Leaves of Grass as a ""language experiment."" The first chapter introduces Whitman's theory of language and literature. Beginning with Whitman's linguistic notebooks, I show how Whitman's studies in historical linguistics align him with German language theorists such as Humboldt and Schleicher. I then argue that Whitman's direct sources for ""organic"" language theory--Christian Bunsen and Maxmilian Schele de Vere--conflate the diachronic and synchronic approaches employed by Schleicher and Humboldt, respectively. In Rambles Among Words, Whitman develops the teleological theory of spiritual evolution that results from the conflation of the diachronic and synchronic approaches. In Whitman's terms, the synchronic ""ensemble"" of the English language reveals the diachronic ""vista"" of its future development. Language and literature come together in Whitman's progressivist vision of American English, for America's ""rich copious hospitable flow"" of language and spirit is to be encouraged through new forms of poetry.    The next two chapters employ the grammatical distinction between the stative and dynamic uses of words to examine word-formations and syntax in the poems of 1855-1856. The second chapter shows how Whitman's conception of the developing American idiom leads him to create nominal forms from verbal bases. Paradoxically, Whitman's nominal forms tend to be grammatically dynamic, signifying temporary, changing concepts. In the 1855-1856 poems, Whitman's innovative word-formations represent human identity as a perpetually changing, temporal activity. The third chapter considers syntactic parallelism and catalogue rhetoric. After discussing the weaknesses inherent in previous classifications of Whitman's syntactic rhythms, I divide Whitman's catalogues into three types: phrasal, clausal, and mixed. The catalogues tend to be grammatically dynamic, and, like the word-formations, they produce an image of the self as a temporally active process. Chapter Three concludes with a close reading of ""The Sleepers.""    The fourth chapter considers the ""cluster"" arrangements of the 1860-1881 Leaves of Grass. The distinction between the stable ""ensemble"" and the changing ""vista"" bears upon Whitman's attempt to give Leaves of Grass a final form. The chapter focuses on the relationship of programmatic poems contained in the ""Chants Democratic"" and ""Leaves of Grass"" clusters to lyric poems contained in such clusters as ""Calamus,"" ""Children of Adam,"" and ""Sea-Drift."" The discussion reveals that the changing form of the last four editions reflects, once again, the process-like identity of the poet.",0
A CAPE BRETON GAELIC STORY-TELLER. (VOLUMES I AND II),"The Scottish Gaelic folklore materials transcribed and translated in this collection have been selected from recordings made between 1976 and 1980 from the Gaelic story-teller Joe Neil MacNeil ('Eos Nill Bhig'), 74, of Middle Cape, Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia. The English translation (Volume One) is supplied with an interpretative introduction (Chapter One) describing the informant's tradition from this Gaelic-speaking region of the Canadian Maritimes and its place within the better-known domain of the Old World Gaelic sgeulaiche (story-teller). The present state of story-telling in Cape Breton, the training of story-tellers, and the effect of printed materials on the tradition are also briefly described.    The first part of the translated text recorded from the informant (Chapter Two) gives an account of his early years in a Gaelic-speaking rural community and the customs and practices associated with the recitation of traditional tales during the early decades of this century. Chapter Three contains fifty-two tales, both complete and partial, grouped according to families of story-tellers in the vicinity who transmitted them to the informant. The tales include one fragment from the Ulster Cycle, some items from the Fenian Cycle (mostly incomplete), hero- and wonder-tales of substantial length, romantic tales, tales of the exemplum type, tales of cleverness, ""numbskull"" stories, fairy lore, witch lore, animal tales, and tall tales. Short sections on story-tellers and story-telling families, including genealogies and traditions concerning the place of emigration in Scotland, precede each group of tales.    The following section (Chapter Four) contains materials on repartee, proverbs, expressions, children's rhymes, traditional games, marriage premonitions, omens and second sight, ghosts and apparitions, and traditional music and dance.    End-notes for each chapter discuss in detail the folklore items, citing other Gaelic versions recorded in Cape Breton, Aarne-Thompson classification numbers for folktales, relevant printed Gaelic sources from Scottish and Irish tradition, and notes on Gaelic expressions and lexical items of interest.    The Gaelic text, contained in Volume Two, is transcribed as told from the tapes. Where necessary, the conventional Gaelic orthography is adapted to reflect the reciter's Uist-Barra dialect.",0
THE COMIC TECHNIQUES OF GEORGE COLMAN THE ELDER,"George Colman's original comedies display competence and variety while being with few exceptions thoroughly laughable. Roman New Comedy has been the primary influence on English comic drama, but Moliere and the Italian commedia dell'arte have been important influences also. Colman knew this comic tradition very well, and thus he deliberately uses traditional materials effectively. His first play, Polly Honeycombe, begins a consistent use of satire in the tradition of Samuel Foote which appears throughout his career. Moreover, the short play is thoroughly typical of farce of the period except that it ends cynically instead of happily. For most of his career Colman wrote comic shorts in a variety of genres such as farce, burletta, and theatrical satire. While of no major consequence individually, these plays use most of the comic techniques seen in the major works. Some, such as The Deuce Is in Him and The Musical Lady, reveal very effective, humorous use of deception plots. Naturally, The Jealous Wife deserves the most extended treatment as Colman's best play. Much of the laughter derives from the secondary characters, but Harriot, instead of being a typical sentimental heroine as some say, proves active, strong-willed, and aggressive. Additionally, she provides much laughter as she moves from one comic predicament to another. Colman's next major original comedy, The Man of Business, probably deserves the neglect critics have had for it. But his last two major original comedies, The Suicide and The Separate Maintenance, indicate that his creative powers did not decline as most critics have thought. Because the two comedies were never published, few have read them. They were, however, popular in their day and deservedly so because they provide much laughter. The Suicide in particular proves to be worthy of the same merit usually attributed to Polly Honeycombe and The Jealous Wife. Throughout his career Colman displays sympathy for middle-class values and scorn for false taste in theatrical affairs. His comic and satiric vision remains consistent from his first play to his last.",0
THE SYNTAX OF VISION: THE AESTHETIC USE OF GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES IN THE VISIONARY POEMS OF W. B. YEATS,"There have been several studies of Yeat's ""powerful and passionate syntax,"" but none has specifically focused on the relationship between grammatical structures and the fairly large number of lyrics which this study refers to as visionary poems. These poems present as their central action the behavior and perceptions of a human mind as it encounters timelessness in some form. Given the inherent temporality of English syntax, it would seem these poems pose unique problems for the verbal artist wishing to create hieratic poetry in the symbolist tradition. This study examines seventeen visionary poems and integrates a description of their grammatical structure with a critical appraisal of their aesthetic impact.    In Chapter I, an examination of Yeats's essays and letters reveal his concern with the aesthetic use of syntax. Yeats's three major concerns in forging a language to his liking were how to capture the ""passion of the speaking voice"" in his poems, how to duplicate the clarity and power of ancient visionary insight, and how to rekindle the living relationship between reader and poem in such a way as to overcome the emotional and psychological distance produced by communicating in print. Syntax is inexorably bound up in each of these concerns, and the linguistic structures which might be expected to reflect Yeats's aesthetic design are listed and described in Chapter II. By syntax this study means the ordering of sentence constituents in both deep and surface structures; in order to get the fullest possible description of Yeats's syntax, such matters as transitivity, selectional features, and pragmatic matters such as text cohesion and speech acts are also considered. (A description of base rules, transformations, and notations used in the analyses is included in the appendices.)    Chapter III examines the Celtic visions--""The Hosting of the Sidhe,"" ""He bids his Beloved be at Peace,"" ""The Unappeasable Host,"" and ""The Valley of the Black Pig""--and pays special attention to those poems published before The Wind Among the Reeds which show the development of Yeats's syntactic strategies for dealing with timeless moments. Chapter IV deals with the Supernatural visions--""Leda and the Swan,"" ""The Mother of God,"" ""Two Songs from a Play,"" ""The Magi,"" ""Veronica's Napkin,"" ""News for the Delphic Oracle,"" and ""Byzantium""--and focuses on the relationship between these poems and the ""primary"" and ""antithetical"" forces of Yeats's A Vision. Chapter V deals with the Prophetic visions--""The Second Coming,"" ""I See Phantoms of Hatred and of the Heart's Fullness and of the Coming Emptiness,"" poem VI of ""Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen,"" ""Parnell's Funeral, I,"" and ""The Gyres."" Chapter VI compares the syntactic strategies of ""The Madness of King Goll,"" ""The Double Vision of Michael Robartes,"" and ""Among School Children,"" showing how Yeats took different approaches to the visionary moment at different times in his career.    Chapter VII incorporates a number of observations about Yeats's visionary syntax into a general description of poetic syntax. It is argued that there are three inherent properties of syntax:  (1) it moves meanings through semantic space, (2) it places events in temporal space, and (3) it orders experience in phenomenological space. The foregrounding or subverting of these properties produces specific effects in the reader called syntactic images. Syntactic imagery is deemed necessary in the translation of pre-phenomenal experience--vision, ecstasy, ""unity of being""--into publicly accessible forms. The impulse to capture the flow and flux of experience in the order and structure of expressive form is seen to be at the root of lyric poetry in general and Yeats's visionary poems in particular.",0
"DR. F. C. KOLBE: PRIEST, PATRIOT AND EDUCATIONIST","Frederick Charles Kolbe was born in George in the Cape Colony in 1854. The son of a Nonconformist minister of the London Missionary Society, his upbringing and early education were strict and pious. He attended school in England and South Africa and it was while he was a student at University College, London, that he was profoundly disturbed by the anti-Christian implications of the philosophical theories of his day. His spiritual problems found solution in the Catholic Faith, which he embraced after a short but intensive course of reading and instruction. Freed from his engagement to a childhood friend, he hoffered himself for the priesthood and after his ordination in 1882, he returned to the Cape and devoted over half a century to the spiritual, cultural and educational welfare of his countrymen.      Proud of his South African heritage, which he traced through his mother's family to a late seventeenth century immigrant from Holland, Kolbe threw himself into the Afrikaner cause in the Anglo-Boer War. This implied no repudiation of his British citizenship or disloyalty to the Crown, but expressed rather his rejection of the unjust policies of imperialism. His patriotism found expression in public speeches, pamphlets and in journalistic campaigns and he was a strong proponent of South Africanism. Among his friends he counted General J. C. Smuts and other leading politicians.    As an educationist of note Kolbe made a significant contribution at tertiary, secondary and primary levels, and was deeply involved in the training of teachers for Catholic schools. As a schoolmaster he taught English language and literature, mathematics, botany, physics and chemistry, with originality and skill. A Shakespearean scholar of distinction he made important contributions in that field, and his public lectures covered literature, philosophy, science, aesthetics and art, and the theory and history of music.     A journalist of wide experience he contributed not only to the Catholic magazine of which he was founder, and editor for many years, but also to other reputable publications. A man of principle, he did not hesitate to use his pen to condemn injustice, political, social or religious, but though his words could be harsh, he was, in the main, loved for his geniality, wit and understanding.     He was honoured by the Catholic Church by being raised to the rank of Monsignor and being made a Domestic Prelate of the Pope. The University of South Africa and the University of Cape Town conferred on him honorary doctorates in literature and Kolbe House in Rondebosch, Cape, together with the University Society and Association bearing his name, are a memorial of his services to the cause of education. He died in 1936, in his eighty-second year, an almost legendary figure, and was mourned by a wide cross-section of people in South Africa, not least by the many children whom he loved.",0
A NATIONAL STUDY OF THE LEVEL OF COMPOSITION ACHIEVEMENT (SUPERIOR/AVERAGE) OF TWELFTH-GRADE COMPOSITION STUDENTS AND SELECTED PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS/ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether significant differences existed among the personal characteristics and environmental factors of twelfth-grade superior writers and twelfth-grade average writers. The thirty-three dependent variables were compared and statistically tested.    The sample (950 randomly selected public high schools) was taken from a population of 19,046 United States high schools. A questionnaire, accompanied with an operational definition of a superior writer or an average writer, was sent to each English department head in the sample. The returned questionnaires included 256 superior writers and 200 average writers.    Using chi-square tests and t tests, the data were analyzed according to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The following conclusions were based upon the significant findings of the study and the review of literature:    (1) The superior writer, compared to the average writer, was more likely to be highly encouraged to read by his parents; was more likely expected by his parents to attend college; came from a family of diverse or less similar interests; was more likely to have a father employed in a profession; considered English teachers as favorite teachers; rated the skill of writing very high; was highly confident in his writing ability; was highly self-motivated; viewed himself as moderately extroverted, neither extroverted nor introverted, or moderately introverted; believed a high level of communication skill would be needed for his career choice; usually enjoyed writing; had a father more formally educated; had a mother more formally educated; had an older father; had an older mother; read more books; had more books in the home; most enjoyed the content areas of science, music, mathematics, or English; was required to write more themes; was more likely to have a mother who had not been employed outside the home since the birth of her first child; and was in the top quarter of his graduating class.    (2) The average writer, compared to the superior writer, was more likely to be encouraged to read or was neither encouraged nor discouraged to read by parents; was more likely expected to attend a trade/technical school or to have no formal education beyond high school by his parents; came from a family with less diverse or more similar interests; was more likely to have a father employed as a businessman, a skilled worker, a semiskilled worker, or a clerk or similar worker; viewed English teachers indifferently or did not like his English teachers; rated the skill of writing lower; was moderately confident or had no confidence in his writing ability; was either moderately self-motivated, indifferent, or motivated to avoid punishment; viewed himself as highly extroverted or highly introverted; believed a moderate level to a moderately low level of communication skill would be required for his career choice; sometimes enjoyed writing or was indifferent to writing; had a father with less formal education; had a mother with less formal education; had a younger father; had a younger mother; read fewer books; had fewer books in the home; most enjoyed the content areas of social studies, art, industrial arts, or business; wrote fewer themes; was more likely to have a mother who was or who had been employed outside the home since the birth of her first child; and was in the top half of his graduating class.",0
AN ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 1926 TO 1976,"The purpose of this study was to describe elementary school music series published in the United States from 1926 to 1976. Areas investigated include:  (1) the extent to which each series provides a written statement of objectives for the music program; (2) the extent to which each series includes songs of a variety of origins, songs in different meters, songs with varying vocal ranges, songs of different scale derivations, music for listening and music for instrumental performance experience; (3) the extent to which each series includes materials or a program designed for music reading and part-singing; (4) the organizational basis of each series; and (5) special features of each series.    Titles of music series were identified by searching bibliographies of doctoral dissertations and the periodical, El-Hi Text Books in Print, for the period under investigation. Both the pupil's book and teacher's edition for each grade level were secured and examined. Preliminary study of the music series indicated the major categories needed to accomplish the analysis encompassed in the five sub-problems. The categories were then incorporated into a data gathering instrument; the data gathering instrument was used for collecting data from each grade level of each series. A computer program was designed and used to compute frequencies and percentages of data concerning:  (1) songs of a variety of origins (23 categories); (2) songs in different meters (5 categories); (3) songs with varying vocal ranges (5 categories); (4) songs of different scale derivations (6 categories); and (5) songs intended for unison and part-singing (7 categories). Data concerning other sub-problems were listed and described.    The fifty years encompassed by this study have seen the following developments in music series published in the United States:  (1) A broadening in the focus of objectives from emphasis on music reading to an overriding concern for the development of musical understanding, performance skills and aesthetic responsiveness. (2) A change in the sources of songs from a repertory dominated by folk songs from Western Europe and songs composed by the series' authors to a repertory which includes increased numbers of folk songs from the United States, Eastern Europe and other parts of the world, songs by recognized composers and songs with foreign language texts. (3) A gradual lowering in the range of songs. (4) An increase in the number of songs based on scales other than major. (5) More complete provision of recordings of the series song repertory. (6) The development of planned listening programs with recordings provided by the publisher. (7) The incorporation of expanded opportunities for instrumental experience. (8) Less emphasis on part singing. (9) Change in the organizational basis from organization based on extra-musical considerations to organization based on a sequence of musical growth. (10) Greater emphasis on evaluating the results of the music program. (11) Increased use of full-color charts and reproductions of paintings for visual reinforcement. (12) Increased emphasis on the relationship of music to other arts. (13) The inclusion of poetry in the series books. (14) Greater use of diagrams and charts. (15) A marked increase in the number of series published (two during the first period compared with seven during the last period).",0
THE PROBLEM OF THE ARTIST IN FRANZ KAFKA'S SHORT STORIES. (GERMAN TEXT),"The present study is concerned with the Kunstlerproblem in Franz Kafka's short stories: Auf der Galerie, Erstes Leid, Ein Hungerkunstler and Josefine, die Sangerin, oder das Volk der Mause. As a literary topic in German literature since the end of the 18th century, Kunstlerproblem means the psychological struggle of an artist arising from his artistic abilities. Divided in three parts, the dissertation is a comparative study, and shows the methodological and linguistic approach to the Kunstlerproblem as well as its historical dimension. In order to place Kafka in this tradition the following works are given a thorough interpretation in the historical section: Goethe's Torquato Tasso, Grillparzer's Sappho and Der arme Spielmann, Keller's Der grune Heinrich and Thomas Mann's Tonio Kroger.    Each interpretation of these six works is introduced by the historical and social background of the individual writer. The methodological section deals with the development of the secondary literature to Kafka's work in general and to the four Kunstlererzahlungen in specific. It demonstrates also the criteria which qualify these four stories as Kunstlererzahlungen, while particularly Eine kleine Frau and Forschungen eines Hundes do not belong to this literary genre.    The study focuses on the Kunstlerproblem as Kafka presents it in his work. Nevertheless his personal problems as an artist, documented in his diaries and letters, are also dealt with, as the close connection between life and work in this subject demands. Thus the section in which Kafka's Kunstlererzahlungen are individually interpreted is introduced by a description of Kafka's situation as a German-speaking Jewish writer in the Czech capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His letters to Felice Bauer reveal his psychological situation. All interpretations, those of Kafka's stories as well as those in the historical section, are based on an analysis of style and structure. Psychological aspects of Kafka's imagery (Sprachbilder) are examined from a structural point of view. In his descriptive language (Bildsprache) he condenses a variety of meanings the same way dreams do.    Each of the four Kunstlererzahlungen is interpreted separately. In addition, certain aspects of the Kunstlerproblem such as art versus life, and artist versus society are thoroughly compared.    The two terms Kunstreiterin and Schone Dame in Auf der Galerie suggest that Kafka uses two different modes of expressing the Getrieben-Werden of an artist's existence and the Nicht-Eingreifen-Konnen of society. The structural analysis of Erstes Leid shows that the narrator's report is intended to justify the behavior of the circus world towards the trapeze artist. He clarifies that neither the Impresario nor any other member of the management is responsible for the artist's suffering. The main emphasis in the interpretation of Ein Hungerkunstler is on the multifaceted aspects of the l'art-pour-l'art-movement. Kafka's last Kunstlererzahlung, Josefine, die Sangerin, oder das Volk der Mause is seen in connection with the Schema zur Charakteristik kleiner Literaturen.    The final chapter examines both Kafka's indebtedness to and his departure from the tradition of the Kunstlerproblem in German literature. Unlike predecessors of Kafka who dealt with the Kunstlerproblem in German literature, he has shown his four artists as prototypes, which like fairy tale-figures are totally two-dimensional. They have no life-stories and exist merely through their artistic abilities. Whereas in the tradition of the Kunstlerproblem, the artists belonged to the fine arts, three of Kafka's artists appear as acrobats, and the fourth one, the singer Josefine, is a mouse. But only on the surface they are less Kunstler than Artisten.",0
Education in Lanarkshire: A Historical Survey up to the Act of 1872 From Original and Contemporary Sources,"The history of education in Lanarkshire, like the history of the Church of Scotland, had its origins in the 4th century, from when until the end of the 11th century, the Scottish Church was Celtic, No evidence remains to show what, if any, schools existed in Clydesdale during that era. In the following five centuries, when the Church was Roman Catholic, there were Grammar Schools at Lanark and Biggar and, possibly, at Hamilton and a number of Song Schools - at Lanark, Biggar, Bothwell and Kilbride- for the Church was then a singing church and schools had to be set up to furnish the necessary training for the clergy and choir boys. These schools lasted until well after the Reformation, exercising a marked cultural influence on the community.    For almost 400 years the Church has been Protestant, and the aim of the Reformers was to plant a school in every parish, where reading, writing and grammar would be taught, so that a literate people might know the Bible and so strengthen Protestantism throughout the country. The blueprint for education laid down by the Reformers was not translated into action largely because the nobles seized the revenues of the Old Church, but the plan of the six Johns, formulated in The First Book of Discipline, remained an ideal towards which the Church continually strove.    In Lanarkshire, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Knox's scheme remained only an outline of what it might have been. The first recorded parochial school in Clydesdale was that at Cambuslang, 1602, Nevertheless, many people, as a result of the Church's zeal, could at least read, and the Bible, which for generations was the main text book in every school in the county, made the people of Clydesdale people of one Book, The State accepted the Churches ideal of a school in every parish and, by a decree of the Privy Council in 1616, required a school to be established and a fit person appointed as a teacher. Unfortunately a loophole was left by the phrasing 'where convenient means may be had and successive Acts of Parliament during the 17th century attempted, with B limited success, to enforce compliance. Before 1660 ten of the thirty seven parishes had schools - Biggar, Carluke, Cambuslang, Dolphinton, Hamilton, Lanark, Lesmahagow, New Monkland, Shotts and Walston and, from 1641, there was a school at Leadhills set up by the Mining Company, By 1696, a further twelve parishes had founded schools - Bothwell, Carmunnock, Covington and Thankerton, Glasford, East Kilbride, Pettinain, Rutherglen, Stonehouse, Walston, Symington, Wandel and Lamington, Wiston and Roberton, but some of these had an uncertain existence and in 1700, there was no longer a school at Walston.    By 1803, while each parish, with the exception of Walston, had a school, there was no uniformity in the system as regards provision of schools and dwelling houses, qualifications of schoolmasters, terms of employment, curricula or methods. At least one third of the schools were without legal salaries, but the ideal laid down by Knox had been broadly realised. In 1834, in the 37 parishes, there were 72 parochial and 352 non-parochial schools, with 90 and 376 teachers respectively. Between 19, 243 and 26, 949 children attended school, but many for one term only. The emphasis was on the three R's, but Latin, Greek:, French, singing and drawing were also taught - Latin in 41 parochial schools, Greek in 29, French in 18, singing in 58 and drawing in 8. The figures for the non- parochial schools were Latin 52, Greek 18, French 10, singing 49, and drawing 15.    Private schools were numerous, either privately endowed or pure adventure schools. Besides the parochial and side schools, there were burgh schools at Lanark, Hamilton, Rutherglen and Airdrie; parliamentary schools; sessional schools; Free Church schools; Assembly schools; Roman Catholic schools; Episcopal schools; ragged schools; reformatories; schools of industry; coal and iron works schools; and mill schools.    Between 1849 and 1872, ten education bills were brought before Parliament, all emphasising the necessity for central and local supervision, inspection and compulsory rating. Following the Act of 1872, with the exception of the Roman Catholic and Episcopal schools, all parochial and burgh schools in Lanarkshire came under State control and, by 1874, 45 School Boards had been set up in the county, with 239 schools and 33,695 children between the ages of 5 and 13 years under their control. Of the 239 schools, 174 were classed as good, 36 as indifferent and 29 as bad. It was estimated that many schools needed to be enlarged and 66 new schools required to be built.",0
Code-Switching Behaviors in a Secondary Band Director,"The purpose of this qualitative case study was to investigate the linguistic and behavioral manifestation of code-switching behaviors in a secondary band director during the music performance assessment preparation period. The inquiry was guided by three sub-questions: (1) What parts of the band director’s verbal and non-verbal language discourse are changing that exemplify code-switching, (2) What are the most prominent themes related to identities and identity roles being observed throughout the band director’s process of code-switching, and (3) What is happening during instruction that provokes the band director to code-switch? Approximately 800 minutes of video recorded data and a post-observation interview were collected and analyzed using Charmaz’s (2014) grounded theory analysis techniques. Code-switching was most evident in contexts when “David” (pseudonym) was building rapport, setting behavioral expectations, and setting performance expectations. Since David identified as an English-speaking monolingual, he exhibited verbal code-switching most often through changes in tone, register, voice inflection, and prosody. His non-verbal code-switching was most prominent through navigating classroom space, adjusting proximity to students, changing his body positioning on the conducting podium, and changing his hand and arm gestures. David’s teacher identity as a band director was exhibited most prominently, yet this identity was driven by various identity roles he navigated while leading band rehearsals. David’s navigation of social identity roles (e.g., The Joker, The Reinforcer, The Father Figure, The Cheerleader, etc.), and the discursive actions he took while enacting them, helped to define contexts in which he code-switched. His identities enacted when establishing rapport directly influenced how code-switching manifested in moments of setting behavioral and performance expectations. Furthermore, identity roles related to rapport building contexts were often concurrently exhibited with other identity roles related to the setting of behavioral and performance expectations. David’s ability to use code-switching to set behavioral expectations allowed him more ease in establishing performance expectations through code-switching. Recommendations for further research on code-switching using sociolinguistic frameworks in music rehearsal settings are included.",0
The Second Sight -A New Opera,"The Second Sight is an opera in three acts that both draws upon the bel canto tradition of operatic singing and explores new possibilities for dramatic vocal writing. By engaging with the historical ideal of opera as dramma per musica - that is “drama through [by means of] music” - the work forwards the uniquely expressive qualities of the vocal instrument, and utilizes a variety of musical materials, forms, and affects to shape the work’s dramatic rhythm. This is combined with a modern, feminist approach to storytelling that uses non-linearity, introspection, and relationality as a means for exploring the nature of being.The opera’s original libretto concerns itself with the spiritual connections between generations of women, especially as developed around the experience of grief. The story centers around a woman named Diskana who has a clairvoyant ability called ""second sight."" After Diskana foresees the death of a young child (Sashatya), and feels the pain of the child's grieving mother (Freyaria), Diskana vows to defy fate and attempt to intervene to prevent the child's death. Supernatural forces (embodied by a group of six Spirits) ultimately weave together the lives of mystic, mother, and child in unexpected ways. The perspectives of the Adult, Spirit, and Child characters in the opera are primarily defined by singing style and phonemic construction, in addition to a variety of other musical parameters. While the Adults sing in a more traditional operatic manner on poetic English text, the Spirits’ music is non-linguistic and consists of a combination of bel canto vocal exercises and contemporary vocal techniques. The Child’s musical language is based on transcriptions of baby-babble, resulting in semi-spoken gestural vocalizations with a proto-linguistic feel. The drama of the opera unfolds as these materials types are variously juxtaposed and interwoven - at first articulating the apparent disconnect between the spiritual and material realms, then illustrating how the Child’s world of creativity and spontaneity can function as a fulcrum between them, and ultimately suggesting that all three ontologies are accessible to those who are in touch with the never ending cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.",0
Frequency Distribution in Phoneme Learning across the Lifespan,"One hypothesis to explain perceptual narrowing in speech perception is the distributional learning account. This account claims that both infants and adults are able to infer the number of phonemic categories through observations of frequency distributions of individual phones in their speech input (Maye, Werker, & Gerken, 2002). Although the distributional learning account indeed provides an insight on how listeners learn phonemic categories in their native language, it is not well understood how it interacts with other sources of information.     The aim of this thesis was to address how listeners utilize distributional cues with other sources of information in learning phonemic categories. The series of experiments described in this thesis examine (a) how infants use distributional information in the presence of multiple speakers and (b) whether the experiences of native language(s) or music, that have been known to be beneficial to some linguistic tasks, interact with distributional information in adults. In the first two experiments (Experiment 1, 2) of Empirical Investigation 1, I investigated whether the use of multiple cues (acoustic variability, visually presented cues, and statistical information) to infer proper phonemic categories is within the capacity of infants. When multiple speakers are presented, computing speaker-specific distribution may be necessary. Providing visual context can guide infants to extract the appropriate phonemic categories. In the following investigations (Empirical Investigation 2 & 3), similar questions were addressed in adults. First, I investigated whether bilingual and/or musical experience affords adults advantages in their sensitivity to frequency distribution in learning non-native stop phonemes (Experiment 3). Second, I examined speakers of two languages, English and Korean, that differ in their use of specific phonetic cues for classifying stop consonants, in their discrimination capacity to non-native stop phonemes and speculated how the presence of specific phonetic features affected sensitivity to the frequency distributional information (Experiment 4, 5).     Overall results suggest that while it was not evident that infants could infer phonemic categories in the presence of speaker variability, adult listeners seem to utilize other sources of information with distributional cues in learning non-native phonemes. Taken together, the findings provide important insights into how listeners utilize frequency distributional information with other sources of information to systematically acquire phonemic categories in native and/or non-native phonology across the lifespan.",0
"An Evolution of Isang Yun’s Compositional Approach: A Comparative Study of <em>Riul</em>, <em>Piri</em> and Clarinet Concerto","Along with Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, Olivier Messiaen, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono and John Cage, a Korean-born German composer named Isang Yun was one of the leading composers in the twentieth century. During World War II, many of these contemporaries consistently sought to achieve new styles of music. Yun expressed his musical language by merging Eastern-Asian traditions with Western-European traditions. He applied the Second Viennese style of twelve-tone technique and transformed it in his way. Furthermore, he gathered his childhood musical memories, Korean traditional music, and his lifelong belief in Taoism to create his own method called Haupttontechnik, an example of fusion between Eastern-Asian and Western-European traditions. Yun applied this unique idea and developed his musical skills throughout his compositions. This research aims to illustrate the evolution of Isang Yun’s compositional approach by analyzing his clarinet works, including Riul, Piri, and Clarinet Concerto. Although Piri was composed for the oboe originally, the piece contributes significant ideas to Yun’s later work, Clarinet Concerto. I firmly believe that Piri links Riul and the Clarinet Concerto.",0
A Pedagogical Approach for Incorporating Extended Techniques into the Undergraduate Clarinet Curriculum,"Although many extended techniques have been included in compositions for clarinet since the early 1900s, very few resources address the inclusion of these techniques in the clarinet curriculum. Specifically, there are very few resources that address the pedagogy of these techniques. Instead, the primary focus of research on extended techniques for clarinet has been on the study and interpretation of works by specific composers or the execution of one type of extended technique. The purpose of this research is to provide a pedagogical resource that addresses the inclusion of extended techniques in the undergraduate clarinet curriculum as a necessary skill for current performance practice and as a tool for further fundamental development. It aims to provide an overview of extended techniques and their history as well to give a concise pedagogical guide that explains each skill. Each chapter will contain sections of exercises, etudes, and solo pieces that will aid in the process of mastering these skills in a more constructive and in-depth format. Five extended techniques have been chosen for inclusion in this document: portamenti, microtones, singing and playing, multiphonics, and double tonguing. These techniques have been selected for their frequent appearance in repertoire and their perceived usefulness for fundamental skill development. Three appendices will be included at the end of the document providing a list of additional works with these extended techniques, a multiphonic fingering chart for the French system clarinet, and a microtonal fingering chart for the same.",0
"Genealogies of <em>Lo Popular</em>: Alterity, Nation, and Industry in the Voice of Julio Jaramillo","This dissertation traces the discursive development of the term música popular, as it was attached to Ecuadorian singer Julio Jaramillo’s life, work and reception history, to show how it functions as a vehicle for racialization in multiple national contexts and along long-standing colonial lines. I reveal polysemic usages of música popular, specific to the Spanish-speaking Americas, that intertwine racializing tropes, nationalistic discourses, and media capital. I mobilize Jaramillo’s positionality as a working-class brown subject who rose to stardom, his hypermasculine figure, gifted voice and musicianship, and transnational music practice to study and theorize lo popular in various registers.     Chapter one follows Jaramillo and his listeners across Ecuador, México, and Colombia to theorize site-specific listening practices and racial formations. Focusing on venues Jaramillo performed at, I argue that a racialized popular subject was constructed as the archetypal Jaramillo listener. This subject signals a rupture to the mestizaje regime and its aural geopolitics. The chapter queries how and why this listener has been constructed as brown, lower-class, and masculine and unsettles these notions through primary sources. Chapter two explores lo popular vis-à-vis the Latin American music industry of Jaramillo’s time. Written in collaboration with record collector Henry Martinez Puerta, this chapter traces Jaramillo’s vast body of work and his widely transnational recording practice. Developing on Jesús Martín-Barbero’s concept of mediation, I show how J.J.’s recorded practice dialogues in complicated ways with hegemonic conceptions of media capital and culture industries. Jaramillo’s mediated music practice was a locus in which alterity was voiced, reified, and transgressed.      Chapter three considers the gender and race dynamics of música popular. Focusing on Jaramillo’s repertoire and his mediated persona, I argue that his music and figure mobilized heteropatriarchal and, often, misogynistic tropes. I contrast these representations with how masculinity is lived and perceived in Latin America to argue that Jaramillo was developed into a site of both masculine fantasy and moral admonishment. Chapter four focuses on Jaramillo’s voice and theorizes singing/listening as deeply embodied practices. Focusing on Jaramillo’s vocality, I unpack the vocal techniques he used to engage with the eclectic repertoire he performed and how he engaged with a wide array of auralities.",0
Using Playback Theater with Adolescents in Refugee Camps in Palestine to Tell Their Stories,"This research aimed at examining the aspects of Playback Theater and how it was experienced by Palestinian adolescents living under the Israeli occupation. Sixteen Palestinian adolescents between the ages of 15 and 16 participated in this study and came from the same school and the same refugee camp although many did not know each other. A Palestinian trainer/conductor who specialized in Playback Theater and who had work experience with adolescents and conducted a 16 session training program designed to teach adolescents about this interactive theatre form. Data collected included the researcher’s observation notes, video tapes that documented the details of all sessions, including a final performance for the adolescents’ mothers and friends. Personal one-to-one evaluation meetings with the participants were conducted, a phone call evaluation with the mothers, and a mid-term and final evaluation meeting with the trainer were other sources of data. All materials collected and recorded for this project were translated from Arabic to English.     	Results revealed that the interaction quality of the group members from the beginning to the end changed over time. Initially, participants had difficulty understanding Playback Theater methods involving improvisation, music, movement, and drama activities. They displayed typical adolescent behavior issues in challenging one another. Despite the difficulties that the participants faced in understanding the Playback method, they ended up enjoying the space given to them to express themselves and share their stories. The three major themes in the research findings suggested that Playback Theater enabled them to get in touch with feelings. First, the researcher and trainer successfully attempted to create safe space using group rules around confidentiality to allow expression of feelings including happiness, sadness, and pride. The second major finding was that a collective space to express grief and sadness for loss of close family members and community members was provided by the Playback Theater. Finally, findings revealed that the chance to learn new skills that were articulated as the ability to listen, to focus, and to interact positively with others was provided. Some of the findings were supported by the mothers’ feedback about the performance and their pride in their sons and their sons’ new skills.",0
The Effect of Different Musical Genres on the Text Recall of Turkish EFL Learners and Involuntary Mental Rehearsal,"There is a general consensus among English teachers that music is a useful element in language teaching, and music is often used in language classes. But there is a neglected point; music is a very broad concept and contains dozens of different genres. This study aims to find out whether the effects of different music genres on text recall of students are different. The participants of this study are 112 high school students in a public school in TurkeyIn this research, there are three experimental groups and one control group. While the experimental groups learned a text for one lesson and listened to the same text in the form of a song three times at the end of the lesson, the control group listened to the text as a spoken recording. Each experimental group listened to one of the rock, jazz and reggae versions of the same song. At the end of this application, some words in the text were deleted and given again in the cloze test form and the participants were asked to write the words they remembered. The same procedure was repeated after two weeks. In this way, it was aimed to find out whether the immediate and delayed text recall performances of the participants vary according to the genres of music. In addition, in this study, whether different musical genres trigger the din, also called as involuntary mental rehearsal, to different extents is inquired.When the results were analysed, no significant difference was observed between experimental and control groups in immediate text recall, while a significant difference was observed between rock and other genres in delayed text recall. It was also observed that jazz is significantly less effective than other genres in triggering involuntary mental rehearsal.Alternate abstract:İngilizce öğretmenleri arasında müziğin dil öğretiminde faydalı bir unsur olduğuna dair genel bir kanı vardır ve dil sınıflarında müzikten sık sık faydalanılır. Fakat ihmal edilen bir nokta vardır ki; müzik çok geniş bir kavramdır ve içinde onlarca farklı tür barındırır. Bu çalışma farklı müzik türlerinin dil öğretiminde öğrencilerin bir metni hatırlamaları üzerine olan etkilerinin farklı olup olmadığını ortaya çıkarmayı amaçlamaktadır. Bu çalışmanın katılımcıları Türkiye’de bir devlet okulunda öğrenim gören 112 lise öğrencisidirBu araştırmada, üç deney grubu ve bir kontrol grubu yer almaktadır. Deney grupları bir metni bir ders saati boyunca işleyip dersin sonunda aynı metni 3 kere şarkı formunda dinlerken, kontrol grubu metni bir konuşma kaydı olarak dinlemiştir. Her bir deney grubu aynı şarkının rock, jazz ve reggae versiyonlarından birini dinlemiştir. Bu uygulamanın hemen sonunda metin, içindeki bazı kelimeler silinerek, cloze test formunda tekrar verilmiştir ve katılımcılardan hatırladıkları sözcükleri yazmaları istenmiştir. Aynı işlem 2 hafta sonra tekrar edilmiştir. Ve bu sayede katılımcıların kısa süreli ve uzun süreli metin hafızalarının müzik türlerine göre değişiklik gösterip gösterilmediği ortaya çıkarılmaya çalışılmıştır. Ayrıca bu çalışma dâhilinde farklı müzik türlerinin istemsiz zihinsel tekrarlama olarak da adlandırılan çınlama hadisesini farklı düzeylerde tetikleyip tetiklemediği de incelenmiştir.Sonuçlar analiz edildiğinde, metni kısa süreli hatırlamada deney grupları ve kontrol grubu arasında belirgin bir fark gözlenmezken, uzun süreli hatırlamada rock türü ile diğer türler arasında anlamlı bir fark gözlemlenmiştir. Ayrıca istemsiz zihinsel tekrarlamanın tetiklenmesi konusunda jazz türünün diğer türlerden belirgin bir biçimde daha az etkili olduğu gözlemlenmiştir.",1
Preservice Teachers' Stories from the Literacy Landscape: Engaging Adolescent Readers & Negotiating the Professional Knowledge Landscape,"This narrative inquiry sought to report and explore the lived experiences of four preservice teachers who took part in a teacher education program at a public university in the southeastern United States. Specifically, this study examined participants’ lived experiences as they related to gaining personal practical knowledge required to be teachers of reading in their specific content-areas. Of these participants, two were social science teachers, one was music, and one was English language arts. All participants took part in an undergraduate literacy course as part of their required Teacher Education Program coursework. The results of this study expand the current literature concerning preservice teachers’ educational needs in undergraduate content literacy courses and provide insight into their perceptions about the goals and realities of teaching literacy skills in their content-areas. Thematic narrative analysis was used to discern themes in the participants’ interviews.     From two in-person interviews per participant and one focus group interview conducted via Zoom, three themes emerged from this inquiry: predominant test-prep pedagogy, discrepancies between literacy course experience and student teaching, and feelings of deficiency related to self-efficacy. Adopting Clandinin and Connelly’s (1995) conception of the professional knowledge landscape of schools, this study utilized qualitative methods of interviewing, transcription, and thematic narrative analysis to draw attention to the ways preservice teachers negotiated tensions within their professional knowledge landscape as they worked to engage adolescents in reading and as they gained personal practical knowledge of literacy instruction.",0
Musical Memories: A Study of Iranian Musical Instruments as Documented in Safavid (1501–1722) Illustrated Manuscripts,"Iranian musical instruments played an integral role in the cultural landscape of the Safavid Court (1501–1722) and their presence in contemporary illustrated manuscripts draws attention to how music fared under the changing tempers of the Safavid shahs. Over the past century of musical conversation, little attention has been paid to the musical instrument traditions in Iran. To make matters worse few musical instruments from this region are held in museum collections, largely due to various obstacles preventing collecting and forty years of sanctions against Iran. Information concerning Iranian musical instruments, outside of their role in Persian classical music, is largely inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, which also contributes to the lack of attention paid to these musical instruments. However, information can be gleaned from interdisciplinary approaches to organology, such as the following analysis of musical instruments featured in illustrations completed over the course of the Safavid Dynasty. Drawing from sources easily available to those in the United States, highlights the need for more English-language sources while also making use of the wealth of information concerning Iran’s instrumental traditions available in manuscript illustrations. Through a discussion of the political and artistic environment of each Safavid shah, a strong understanding of the unstable position of art music in Iran under the Safavids is presented. Using illustrations as primary sources for musical history also addresses how music was incorporated into Iran’s visual language that continued to be employed by Safavid-era artists.",0

A Description of Naso Verbal Art,"This dissertation is an analytic description of aspects of Naso speech play and verbal art. It employs intersecting methodologies of language documentation and description, ethnography, and speaker intuitions. Naso is a Chibchan language spoken in Panama by approximately 500 fluent individuals, and its speakers are shifting to primary use of the Spanish language at an accelerated pace. Speech play and verbal art are used by Nasos in ways that index their social identities and relationships with life forms and political structures, as well as how they interpret the vitality of their language and culture.Linguistic strategies used in speech play and verbal art include cross-linguistically common processes such as high pitch, vowel lengthening, and use of creaky voice and other voice qualities. They also include typologically unique strategies such as the distortion of sibilant consonants, vowel lowering, and idiomatic tags which set up humorous frames of interaction, such as one in which interlocutors are addressed in the third person. The more complex strategies of verbal art build from speech play, and include common resources such as anecdotes, myths, and song. The unique genres of Naso verbal art include tjlõkwo rong ‘profound words’, which formally resemble the parallel poetic couplet difrasismos widespread across the greater geographical region of Mesoamerica.I show how these specific speech play and verbal art strategies are employed in social exercises of the imagination and creativity surrounding two themes of Naso lifeː recreation, and nostalgia. Analysis of specific texts in context reveals that Naso speakers index their complex identities, including their indigeneity, through ‘profound words’ embedded in nostalgic rumination, and they index their agility, wit, and self-teasing traits in humorous or recreational interactions. The nostalgic function of ‘profound words’ is analyzed as working through principles of ambiguity and vagueness—mechanisms which explain cases of verbal art that younger generations identify productively.This dissertation directly portrays native speaker intuitions of verbal art through quoted monologues that guide the preface of each chapter. Besides being informed by creative Naso individuals as well as prevalent Naso socio-cultural views, the dissertation takes areal-comparative and typological perspectives, demonstrating the theoretical contribution of speech play and verbal art more broadly to linguistics and the humanistic study of society.",0
"History as theatrical metaphor: history, myth and national identities in modern scottish drama","The completion of History as Theatrical Metaphor, now submitted for consideration for the award of the degree of Doctor of Letters, represents an integration and culmination of a number of related strands arising from both my practice as a playwright over the last five decades and my relevant academic research. Susanne Kries has summarised a key approach underlying my writing of history plays as ‘deconstructing the ideological intent behind the very endeavour of writing history and of revealing the ways by which mythologies are formed’. Much of my related academic research shares this interest. A recurring theme of both playwriting and scholarly writing, central to the work submitted, is the significance of the interaction of drama, language – especially Scots and English – and history. The initial phase in exploring such themes was in my developing professional playwriting practice. In 1967, I wrote the first draft of Mary, eventually produced by the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company in 1977. In this first version I sought to address the theme of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, but in a revisionary way. The play’s first acts, before Mary arrives on stage, involved an unlikely affair between Mary of Guise, Queen Regent in Mary’s absence in France, and her Secretary of State, Maitland of Lethington, conceived as a cross between a Chief Minister and a Mafia consigliere, a relationship in which Mary of Guise achieved some form of Lawrentian ‘authentic’ sexual release and self-fulfilment through her relationship with a powerful Scots leader. This motif was developed when Mary arrived and proceeded to fall under the magnetic spell of the even more Lawrentian Bothwell, a transformation of her sexuality and identity marked by the fact that about half way through her scenes she stopped speaking in French-inflected English and started to speak in Scots. The play’s tendentiousness was further marked by its being written in Scots-language free verse. The decision to write in Scots was consciously, if superficially, ideological. It sought to reflect the vibrant language amongst which I grew up on a council scheme, although in my home the dominant language was Standard Scottish English. I also sought to take a revisionary view of Scottish history, seeking to avoid what I saw as the sentimentalisation of that history in plays by an older generation like that of Robert McLellan. What I was concerned to do was later outlined explicitly by Tom McGrath in a 1984 interview, talking of his own practice: I suppose at that time we were coming up with a different ideology. We were coming up with a different approach after all that work, work that had been done [by writers like MacDiarmid and McLellan] in Scots language. We were coming up with this street level sound of existentialist man in the street, ""black man in the ghetto"" type of writing. It just upset the applecart. (Later I would develop a contextual interpretation of the shift McGrath refers to, and which I sought to be part of, in arguing that the use of Scots on stage was key to supporting and enhancing the cultural prestige of Scots in the 2011 chapter, ‘Drama as a Means for Uphaudin Leid Communities’. This – in a continuing conscious intention to assert the potential and status of Scots – while academic in content, was written entirely in Scots.) In short, from the beginning of my professional playwriting, a key strand was experiment in and exploration of the relationship of drama, Scots language, community identity and history, particularly the interrogation of accepted versions of ‘history’. The first draft of Mary came by the early 1970s to seem to me to be unsatisfactory in its exploration of the interaction of drama, language and history. By then, it appeared in its sensationalist version of Scottish history to have fallen into a parallel trap to the earlier one of a sentimental and romanticised view of that history. It certainly had moved away from conventional treatments of Scotland’s past, but was rather tending to a simplistic dramatic interpretation pour épater les bourgeois. Indeed, its attempts at sexual directness made it unacceptable at that time, 1968-69, to the management of the Royal Lyceum. While its Literary Manager Alan Brown spoke positively of the play, he still felt the company could not present it. Within very few years my own view came to be that, while it might substitute a certain late-adolescent Scots-language raunchiness for earlier playwrights’ Scots-language sentimentalities, it was itself somewhat naïve and sentimental. Further, the use of Scots in a free verse form, rather than adding anything to the dramatic potential of Scots language, seemed to remove it from the everyday discourse which inspired me to use it in the first place. This change of critical perspective and creative intention arose from two related developments in my dramaturgy. One was the impact of a variety of late 1960s theatrical experiments which impressed me in dealing with historical and political material in a post-Shavian and post-Brechtian way. These included the 1964 film version of Peter Brook's production of Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade, which I saw in 1968, John Spurling's MacRune's Guevara (1969) and Peter Nichols's The National Health (1969) in the programme of the National Theatre in London, New York’s Negro Ensemble Company's version of Peter Weiss's The Song of the Lusitanian Bogey, which is concerned with Portuguese colonial exploitation, presented in the 1969 London World Theatre Season, and John Arden and Margaretta D'Arcy's version of Horatio Nelson’s life and reputation, The Hero Rises Up, presented by Nottingham Playhouse at the 1969 Edinburgh Festival. I was further impressed by the theatrical techniques of the New York-based LaMama troupe, by its version of Paul Foster's Tom Paine (1967) and the popularised and commercialised exploitation of those techniques in Hair (1967). I had also read Foster's Heimskringla! Or The Stoned Angels (1970), written for LaMama and derived from Norse sagas. All employed varying metatheatrical techniques to deconstruct received versions of history and politics which extended my own understanding of what was creatively possible. The second development was that, as those plays affected my understanding of theatrical possibilities in exploring historically based themes, I was researching and beginning to draft my next play on a historical theme. This explored the life, business ethics and politics of Andrew Carnegie. On top of all of this, at this time, having showed Max Stafford-Clark, Artistic Director of the Traverse Theatre, a first draft of Carnegie, begun during the autumn of 1969, I was invited by him to work, in my first professional theatre role, as a writing assistant on the first Traverse Workshop Theatre Company production, Mother Earth (1970), directed by Stafford-Clark when he ceased to be director of the Traverse itself. With his new company, he was developing the deconstructionist and improvisational rehearsal techniques that would later be more widely thought of as the creative method of his Joint Stock Theatre Company, into which the Traverse Workshop Company morphed in 1974. The dramaturgical lessons learned from the examples cited above and by working with such a creative and methodologically innovative director as Stafford-Clark were allied to my own quizzical view of Carnegie’s reputation. This was partly derived from the fact that my great-grandfather was a first cousin of Carnegie’s. There were family stories which, if they did not fully undermine his philanthropic reputation, suggested there were other sides to his career.",0
"Arguing Their World: The Representation of Major Social and Cultural Issues in Edna Ferber's and Fannie Hurst's Fiction, 1910-1935","Between the early decades of the twentieth-century and mid-century, Edna Ferber and Fannie Hurst were popular and prolific authors of fiction about American society and culture. Almost a century ago, they were writing about race, immigration, economic disparity, drug addiction, and other issues our society is dealing with today with a renewed sense of urgency. In spite of their extraordinary popularity, by the time they died within a few months of each other in 1968, their reputations had fallen into eclipse. This dissertation focuses on Ferber's and Hurst's fiction published between approximately 1910 and 1935, the years in which both authors enjoyed the highest critical and popular esteem. Perhaps because these realistic narratives generally do not engage in the stylistic experimentation of the literary world around them, literary scholars came to undervalue their work. My close readings and consideration of secondary socio-political sources establish the importance of this body of fiction as a reflection of and influence on social issues of their day, with contemporary reverberations. The social and cultural issues with which the authors are concerned include cultural diversity in Ferber's  Cimarron (1929), her representation of the increasing homogenization of American culture in Show Boat (1926), and the association of her intensely visual writing style with the historical mural cycles of Thomas Hart Benton in her early regional novels. Hurst's equally wide-ranging concerns include representation of the rise-and-fall of German-American culture; food insecurity, weight, and non-standard body type in narratives about cultural assimilation and acceptance of diversity; the impact of the 1920s opioid epidemic on upper-middle-class families, and her modernist experiment in Lummox  (1923), in which she combines a realistic social-justice narrative calling for the equitable treatment of domestic workers with a modernist narrative that describes an inarticulate woman's search for self-expression through music. Through this work of recovery and restoration, I strive to demonstrate that through the characters who populate their fiction and the personal and societal issues they confront, Edna Ferber and Fannie Hurst are still speaking to us—and that there is much to learn from them.",0
"Moors, Mulattos, and Post-racial Problems: Rethinking Racialization in Early Modern England","This dissertation, Moors, Mulattos, and Post-Racial Problems: Rethinking Racialization in Early Modern England, examines early modern English dramatic representations of interethnic relations between black and white figures. It focuses on those representations that both garner and elude classification as racist, and it argues that the most appropriate means of recovering the subtle modes of racialization that engender these conflicting classifications is through consideration of African American writers and thinkers.     Broadly speaking, early modern ethnicity studies have moved from exploring the period’s denigratory approaches to African blackness toward identifying its counterintuitive modes of engaging such difference. This shift in criticism has brought to the fore potential sites of tolerance but fails to account for the period’s contemporaneous racism. This dissertation argues that this shift has led to a critical dissonance that resembles the popular discord about the persistence or dissipation of today’s racial systems. For example, early modern scholars have begun to mistakenly characterize seemingly progressive early modern phenomena like black ascendency, interracialism, and interethnic cooperation as multicultural. Comprehensive early modern racism is obscured by such concepts of racial transcendence.     As this dissertation argues, even the problematic perspective that the early modern period might be described as multicultural offers insight. It emphasizes early modernity’s difference from histories embedded in high colonialism, transatlantic slavery, and scientific racism, while rendering the period’s affinities with more recent historical moments. Indeed, the early modern period exhibits a type of discursive interest in the cultural potential of practices like racial mixing that wanes until American abolition. Such similarities comprise a bridge between the racial conceptions of the early modern period and those of post-abolition America. However, when these tolerant-seeming concepts are approached through dominant modes of analysis, they appear to contravene contemporaneous racism. African American analyses offer a more comprehensive approach. Black writers helped shift norms regarding topics like interracialism, but they concurrently explored the multivalent modes of intolerance that accompanied softened cultural prescriptions. This dissertation uses these investigations to recover the multifarious racialism that works through depictions of tolerant phenomena on the early modern stage.     This dissertation’s first chapter emphasizes the silences engendered by the competing depictions of black ascendency and overt racism in Shakespeare’s Othello. It reads early modern English denials of slave trading along with Toni Morrison’s Desdemona to demonstrates where Othello navigates and thus obscures its more insidious anti-blackness. The second chapter examines how interethnic cooperation in George Peele’s Alcazar concurrently gives rise to a dramatic paradigm for anti-black assimilation. It turns to Zora Neale Hurston’s exploration of precarious methods for broaching transracial fellowship to elucidate this paradigm. The following chapter contends that Ben Jonson’s Masque of Blackness employs a mode of appropriation that relies on early modern England’s increasing familiarity with and distaste for aspects of phenotypic African difference. It explores this mode by reading Kendrick Lamar’s “The Blacker the Berry” – a song that considers how appropriative acts require an understanding of both desired and undesired aspects of black culture. The final chapter reads the sensational take on interracialism in Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus alongside exceptionalizing American views of racial mixing, arguing that each approach obscures histories of the topic that conflict with dominant cultural interests. It emphasizes Titus’s myopia concerning interracialism by bringing the play into conversation with underacknowledged Elizabethan records of children born to white men and enslaved black women.",0
Visiting Chinese Grandparents in the United States: Stories about Raising Grandchildren on a Different Continent,"Cooking, dish washing, clothes washing, all kinds of house chores, and the most important thing: baby care, including bottle feeding, cuddling, singing lullaby, rocking to sleep, taking outdoors for play, night care, and etc, take up the lives of visiting Chinese grandparents in the United States. It is common that Chinese grandparents lean in to help raise grandchildren, no matter within China or wherever their grandchildren reside in, especially at the age of an infant or a toddler. They are more than willing to make sacrifices: stepping out of the comfort zone, trading carefree lives for tiring child care, leaving behind family members and friends, having limited social lives for lack of English skills and driving licenses. This paper consists mainly of the four-month life of a Chinese grandmother—Bin Wan—and her grandson, a story I fully participate in as the major beneficiary. While living together, there is not only gratitude for her hard work, but also dispute over child care and postpartum care. This paper also includes a Chinese community in the upper valley area, consisting of Ph.D. candidates, postdoctoral fellows, and employees at Dartmouth College, who have benefited from grandparent’s help for a couple of months or a few years.",0
The Palais Garnier: Toward an Architecture of Dance and Music in XIX Century France,"As a doctoral candidate, this writer has focused on the Romantic Movement of 19th century France, where the arts mutually influenced each other, just as in ancient Greece and Rome. This research highlights the interrelationships of the Arts to Architecture by examining artists such as Hugo in drama, Gautier in literature, Delacroix in painting, Chopin and Adam in music, Noverre in dance and Garnier in architecture. Although Noverre’s specialty was dance, he believed that theater buildings were first monuments to the arts. For Garnier, 100 years later, the Arts and Architecture were not separate identities. They complemented and enhanced one another. Both books, Observations sur la Construction d’une Nouvelle Salle de l’Opera by Jean-Georges Noverre and Le Theatre by Charles Garnier, were publications translated extensively from French to the English language as primary sources.    In designing a theater building, the architect is responsible for synthesizing and translating myriad information in order to create an appropriate and responsive language. An invaluable knowledge of technical considerations—set design, lighting, backstage equipment, sightlines, acoustics and facilities for performers—is critical, as is balancing the client’s concerns and the user/spectator’s needs. As performance expresses a cultural instinct for communicative involvement, this writer believes that a theater building, itself, is a reflection of the arts. It is art, therefore, that inextricably shapes the programs and designs of our theater buildings.    The Palais Garnier, completed in 1875 for the Paris Opéra and its associated Paris Opéra Ballet, is thought to mirror the cultural complexity of the age. Before this time, the Paris Opéra was housed in the Salle Le Peletier, a temporary building with inadequate facilities that did not reflect the existing, lavish, highly skilled art that was performed. Garnier’s travels to ancient sites in Greece and Rome resulted in his classic book, Le Théatre. By writing, he immersed himself in the study of the physical qualities of the theater, and it eventually became his architecture.    The form and character of the theater buildings studied reflect the changing social structures, technology and patronage that sponsored them. The  Palais Garnier reflects a unique intersection of the arts, along with the political, social and economic influences of that time. Musicians turned their attention toward the expressions of intense feelings that were influenced by poetry and the visual arts. The Palais Garnier, with its grandeur and opulence, became its own “performance”.    The multi-disciplinary nature of architecture and the study of the interrelationships of the arts can inform creativity. Just like the timeless, majestic  Palais Garnier in Paris, in 19th century France, new architectural structures can become their own profound monumental  and memorable “performances” for future generations.",0
"<i>Cholibiris Chicha Madeinusa Warmi</i>: performance andina de los <i>Zorros</i> de Arguedas en los medios y las artes del Perú: Tulio Loza, Lorenzo Palacios ""Chacalón"" y Magaly Solier (1960-2010)","My dissertation focuses on the Andean cultural contribution of three Peruvian massmedia artists: Tulio Loza, TV star comedian; Lorenzo Palacios Quispe “Chacalón [Big Jackal]”,  chicha music star, and Magaly Solier, a film star of the late 20th and early 21st century. This dissertation is based on an interpretation of Andean writer José María Arguedas’ novel The Fox From Up Above and the Fox From Down Below (1971) as a theorical/poetic approach to modern Andean culture. Therefore, the first chapter presents the phenomena of Andean migration to the capital, starting in 1940, as a main component of its transformation. In the novel, the mythological characters of “Foxes” portray the personification of “Migrant” agents that accompany the Andeans to the coast. That cultural display, seen as “writing”, is called Andean performance.   The second chapter analyzes the figure of Loza. Associated with the “cholo” –Andean migrant–, Loza won popularity from the 1960’s until the 1980’s by performing a new cosmopolitan and picaresque image of the Quechua speaker in the “modern” Spanish speaking city. Loza’s characters drew a polarized identity of Peruvians as  criollos (western urban subjects) and as “indigenous” (Andean cultural subjects).   The third chapter explores the career of “Chacalón”, who reached fame after a marginal childhood coming from an Andean migrant family in Lima. The urban idol of the masses became a figure of quasi religious devotion after his death in 1994.   The fourth chapter examines the career of Solier, “discovered” as an actress by Peruvian filmmaker Claudia Llosa in 2005. The partnership of a Quechua young talent and a director of hegemonic criollo group caused controversy among the national audience while obtaining several international awards.   The fifth chapter presents Arguedas’ novel as a theoretical tool envisioning the physical and cultural “invasion” of Lima by Andean migrants, as represented in this study by the artists who convey three attributes of the “Foxes”: humor, music, acting.   This dissertation links Performance and Andean studies: identity  is observed as ‘agencies’ in migration rooted in the body. Research also involved field works and several interviews. An appendix includes unpublished interview transcripts and visual material.",0
Beethoven's Catholicism: A reconsideration,"Since the middle of the nineteenth century, accounts of Beethoven’s religious attitudes have consistently sought to separate the composer from the Catholic religion in which he was born. It is often assumed that, as a child of the Enlightenment, Beethoven cannot have felt a strong affinity for Catholic beliefs, preferring instead an idiosyncratic and unorthodox approach to religion that was suspicious of dogma and tradition. This has led, in turn, to the scholarly marginalization of his religious music, with the  Missa Solemnis being the notable exception. On the one hand, Beethoven’s religious works other than the Missa have been frequently dismissed as inauthentic “occasional works” written purely for commercial reasons. On the other hand, the Missa itself, though regarded as a “true” Beethoven work, has been largely interpreted as a de-Catholicized vehicle for the expression of the composer’s untraditional religious outlook.    This dissertation challenges long-accepted views of Beethoven and his religious music by demonstrating that they were more heavily influenced by Catholic theological ideas than is usually thought. I focus especially on the connection between the composer and the Bavarian Catholic theologian Johann Michael Sailer (1751–1832), the most important contemporary religious figure for understanding Beethoven’s religious attitudes. In addition, given its monumental scale and its prominence in Beethoven scholarship, I devote special attention to the Missa Solemnis, which the composer was working on at the time of his first documented contact with Sailer and his writings. However, I also investigate other evidence linking Beethoven with the Catholicism of his time: religious references in documentary sources such as Beethoven’s letters, his Tagebuch, and the Heiligenstadt Testament; religious books by theologians other than Sailer in Beethoven’s library; and the musical content of the religious works Beethoven wrote before the Missa, especially the  Gellert-Lieder, Christus am Ölberge, and the Mass in C.     My study shows that much previous scholarship has misinterpreted or overlooked the significance of such evidence, owing to an inadequate understanding of the complex nature of German Catholicism during Beethoven’s era. I draw on revisionist historical research showing that the Enlightenment was not, as is often believed, fundamentally opposed to traditional religious belief. Beethoven’s religious environment was, for instance, defined by a historical phenomenon that has been called the German Catholic Enlightenment, which, broadly speaking, attempted to reconcile Catholic belief with some of the liberal, progressive ideals normally associated with the Enlightenment in general. The composer appears to have been interested in several specific religious themes emblematic of this Catholic Enlightenment. At the same time, he seems also to have been attracted by some other ideas associated with the Catholic Restoration, a movement that emerged at least partly in opposition to the Catholic Enlightenment. This mixed allegiance was similar to that which characterized Sailer’s theology, and likely accounts for why he found Sailer such an appealing figure around the time he was composing the Missa Solemnis.    A more complete and historically coherent understanding of Beethoven’s religious context suggests that the composer was more of a Catholic than he has so often been made out to be, albeit one who was attracted to varieties of Catholicism that have become obscured by the mists of history.",0
Applied therapeutic interventions for children diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and/or posttraumatic stress disorder,"This qualitative study investigated applied therapeutic interventions in children ages 2-18 diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The researcher’s experience when seeking TBI/PTSD care inspired her concern for traumatized children and their parents. Nine licensed or licensure-eligible mental health professionals (i.e. Ph.D., LPC, LCSW) participated in this study. All participants conducted therapy with children diagnosed with TBI and/or PTSD, were English-speaking, and worked in North Carolina or Virginia.    Responses to a questionnaire consisting of 15 open-ended questions were obtained by a combination of in-person interview and online completion. The key inquiry regarded applied therapies for children diagnosed with TBI and/or PTSD. Secondary questions inquired about referral percentages for children diagnosed with TBI and/or PTSD, causes of TBI and/or PTSD, why those therapies were selected and why considered efficacious, communication between providers, and sufficiency of the DSM-5 criteria for TBI and PTSD.     Motor vehicle accidents, falls, and physical abuse were reported as TBI origins. Consistent with a review of the literature, TF-CBT, dance yoga therapy, safe physical activities, and music therapy were indicated to be efficacious for children diagnosed with TBI.    Consistent with review of the literature, Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is considered by this small sample of therapists to be the most effective therapy for children diagnosed with PTSD. Other frequently reported PTSD interventions were play therapy, EMDR, Schema-Focused Therapy (SFT), dance yoga, and art/music therapy.    Participants reported that sexual abuse was the predominant cause of PTSD in their cases involving traumatized children. Domestic violence, witnessing violence, physical and/or emotional neglect, emotional/psychological/physical/abuse, falls, loss of caregiver, motor vehicle accidents, or a combination, were also indicated as causes. The results also indicated a potentially serious problem regarding lack of proper assessment/referral for children suffering TBI. The DSM-5 criteria were not considered sufficient for the diagnosis of TBI and/or PTSD by several responding therapists.  Key words: Children, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), therapeutic interventions, TF-CBT, play therapy, EMDR, Schema-Focused Therapy (SFT), DSM-5",0
"African Initiated Churches: The Case of the <i>Igreja Evangélica Amor de Deus, Romanos 5:5, em Moçambique</i> (Love of God Evangelical Church, Romans 5:5, in Mozambique)","African Initiated Churches:     The Case of the Igreja Evangélica Amor de Deus, Romanos 5:5, em Moçambique     (Love of God Evangelical Church, Romans 5:5, in Mozambique)     This dissertation presents an ethnographic study of the Igreja Evangélica Amor de Deus, Romanos 5:5, em Moçambique (Love of God Evangelical Church, Romans 5:5, in Mozambique) or IEAD, an African Initiated Church (African Independent Church, African Indigenous Church) or AIC among the Sena people of north-central Sofala and southeastern Tete Provinces of Mozambique, as a specific case of the phenomenon of African Initiated Christianity.     Chapter one presents the need for the study, namely, that the Sena people are a severely understudied group, and that few studies have been published in English about AICs in Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) Africa. The researcher's positionality is acknowledged and key theoretical presuppositions underlying the study are presented, including the author's understanding of the contextualization of Christianity. Then the chosen research methodology, ethnography, is described, as are the primary data-gathering techniques employed.     Chapter two recounts the story of the founding and growth of the IEAD with special emphasis on the life of founder Josefa Chano Estivene (b. 1937). Critical incidents in Estivene's life are recounted, from his evangelical conversion in a Mission Initiated Church or MIC, through his part in the founding of one AIC (the Igreja Evangélica da Nova Aliança de Jesus, Hebreus 8:8 or IENAJ), his exit from that church along with a group of colleagues, and their founding under Estivene's leadership of the Igreja Evangélica Amor de Deus, Romanos 5:5, em Moçambique or IEAD, as a direct result of Estivene's receiving a revelatory dream from God. The growth of the IEAD since its founding is outlined, highlighting the church's success despite significant opposition from inside and outside the group.      Chapter three first describes in detail a typical IEAD worship service and their manner of celebrating the sacrament of the Eucharist, followed by a description of their contextualized version of the chisasa, the traditional Sena baby-naming ceremony, which they have transformed into a Christian rite of passage. IEAD worship is then analyzed to identify its key components: Spontaneous expressions of praise, music and dance, prayer, testimonies, preaching, and giving. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the IEAD's use of sacred space.     Chapter four considers IEAD theology, although the church has no formal, written statement of belief. The authoritative sources of IEAD theology are examined using the Wesleyan Quadrilateral as a template. Then, based partly on sermons by church leaders, but primarily on the lyrics of numerous songs sung by the people of the IEAD as they worship (Appendix C includes the text of twenty-three of the these cited in this dissertation, along with English translations), four key themes in IEAD theology are identified and examined: The nature of God, the meaning of conversion, the benefits of salvation, and love as characteristic of Christian relationships.     In chapter five, the IEAD's status as an authentic AIC is considered. First, it is shown to be distinctively African in character. Next, the church's claim to be indisputably African initiated is demonstrated through an analysis of the three stages--protest, schism and divine calling--through which Estivene passed as he became the church's Founder. Following this, the IEAD's claim to be an authentic Christian church is verified by showing that it displays all three of the traditional Protestant notae ecclesiae. The chapter ends by discussing some of the effects of globalization on the IEAD and by noting the challenges it faces as it transitions to a second generation of leadership.     Finally, in chapter six the study closes by suggesting several missiological implications of the study's findings, offering the author's own evaluation of the study, and suggesting avenues for future research into AICs in Mozambique and throughout Lusophone Africa.",0
Effects of music on joint attention between individuals with autism and neurotypical siblings,"Given that a common social skills deficit for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is joint attention, and that development in joint attention can cause improvement in other social skill deficit areas such as affect, imitation, initiation of socialization, and expressive language (Ferraioli & Harris, 2011), it is necessary to examine treatment options that promote joint attention. This study measured the effects of music versus non-music interventions on joint attention between individuals with ASD and neurotypical siblings.      One sibling pair (dyad) participated in this study. To be eligible for the study, one sibling must have an ASD diagnosis, be between the ages of 6 to 10 years old, have a sibling up to three years older with no ASD or related diagnosis, speak English as a primary language, and both siblings free of significant visual or hearing impairments.      The sibling dyad received two fifteen-minute sessions a week for two weeks. The first session of each week was a music session designed to elicit joint attention in siblings. In the second session of each week, the group participated in a fifteen-minute non-music session designed to elicit joint attention between siblings. The neurotypical sibling primarily led these sessions, with video instruction shown to the participants before each task in the sessions.",0
Temporalidade E Estética Do Impressionismo Musical: Na Filosofia Se Vladimir Jankélélitch,"O principal propósito deste trabalho é a investigação da Filosofia da Música na obra do filósofo francês-russo Vladimir Jankélévitch. Este estudo pretende alcançar uma perspectiva ampla da música considerando as suas relações com a Filosofia, Metafísica, Religião e Estética. O tema principal foi o Impressionismo Musical e a questão do Tempo.Vladimir Jankélévitch deixou atrás de si uma obra surpreendente, tanto no campo da Filosofia como no campo da Música. Os seus escritos no contexto da Ética e da Moral espelham a devoção que, ao longo da sua vida, a música e a performance representaram no seu percurso filosófico. Em contraponto ao estudo filosófico, sempre se fez acompanhar pela Estética Musical, ao mesmo tempo que se ocupava dos compositores modernistas. A sua obra consegue conciliar estas duas vertentes, a filosófica e a musical, exprimindo, deste modo, a quintessência do seu pensamento. Jankélévitch debruça-se sobre as questões clássicas da Filosofia da Música, reunindo-as com a Metafísica e a Ontologia, que funcionaram como o ponto de partida para as suas análises posteriores, onde o autor tenta desconstruir o sentido hermenêutico que, de um modo geral e convencional, se foi atribuindo à música.Por conseguinte, esta investigação aprofundada interpretando os textos do autor, tem como finalidade analisar não apenas aquilo que escreveu sobre Filosofia, mas os seus diversos estudos sobre Musicologia, especialmente os textos sobre Fauré, Debussy e Ravel. Ao estudarmos a música francesa do fin-de-siècle, as suas análises aprofundadas e a relevância que dá a esta época, esses textos transmitem-nos conhecimentos fundamentais que nos permitem avaliar melhor, não só o que escreveu sobre música, até porque ele faz referências musicais mesmo nos textos considerados não-musicais, meramente filosóficos, o que nos indica que, para compreendermos Jankélévitch, temos de conhecer toda a obra e vê-la num conjunto global. Ao longo da nossa investigação, o que podemos depreender da leitura de Jankélévitch é que o Impressionismo Musical é um fenómeno francês e russo-eslávico, que tem em mira a música espanhola. Por essa razão, nos detivemos durante tanto tempo na Parte I desta tese a explorar as relações da Filosofia Russa com a noção de Filosofia da Vida e de Vitalismo. Nas suas considerações sobre o Modernismo, Jankélévitch considera que Fauré, Debussy e Ravel são vitalistas e naturalistas, que rejeitaram o expressionismo. Esta genealogia do Modernismo está permanentemente envolvida com as questões mais recorrentes da Metafísica, com a Filosofia Antiga de Platão, Aristóteles e do Neoplatonismo, entre as quais Jankélévitch vai introduzindo um dos seus autores de referência, Henri Bergson, sobrevoando várias correntes de pensamento, com a finalidade de demonstrar que a música é um fenómeno do Tempo. Ao conceber a arte musical como uma realidade temporal, vê-la deste modo como algo que está em vias de surgir, que está em criação permanente, significa que não existem estruturas definidas e que a música é somente o instante. Um instante da expressão da vida, um Je-ne-sais-quoi misterioso que nos deslumbra.Alternate abstract:The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the Philosophy of Music in the writtings of the French-russian philosopher Vladimir Jankélévitch. This study aspires to have a broad perspective of music and its relations with Philosophy, Metaphysics, Religion and Aesthetics. Our main subject is Musical Impressionism and the question of Time.Vladimir Jankélévitch left behind a remarkable oeuvre steeped as much in Philosophy as in Music. His writings on moral quandaries reflect a lifelong devotion to music and performance, and, as a counterpoint, he wrote on Music Aesthetics and on modernist composers. His Opus brings together these two threads, the philosophical and the musical, as an extraordinary quintessence of his thought. Jankélévitch deals with classical issues in the Philosophy of Music, including Metaphysics and Ontology. These are a point of departure for a sustained examination and dismantling of the idea of musical hermeneutics in its conventional sense.As an interpretative orientated study, this research had an interest in understanding not only the philosophy works of Jankélévitch, but also his several studies on Musicology, specially his writings about Fauré, Debussy and Ravel. Its direct relevance to fin-de-siècle French music gives us the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills specific to our discipline to a critique of his musical writings; since he also addresses it in his nonmusical writings, it allows us to broaden the scope of our critique to include his work as a whole. The findings of this study suggest that Musical Impressionism, for Jankélévitch, is a French and Russo-slavic phenomenon, with Spain in second orbit. That is why the “Part I” of this research is devoted to Russian Philosophy and its relations with the notion of Philosophy of Life and Vitalism. In his accounts of Modernism, Fauré, Debussy and Ravel are seen as vitalists and naturalists, rejecting expressionism and consequently embracing various alternatives – objective impression, inexpressiveness, mask, ineffable, etc… This aesthetic genealogy of Modernism is bound up with recurring questions about Metaphysics, Ancient Philosophy of Plato, Aristoteles and neoplatonism, in which Jankélévitch flies his Bergsonian philosophy predilection, by insisting that music is material phenomenon of Time. Seeing musical works as temporal, as a form of Becoming, means that there are not structures and music is just merely instant. An instant of life expression, Je-ne-sais-quoi that astonishes us.",0
Art music in British public discourse during the First World War,"This study examines English musical life during the First World War through public musical discourse. It uses contemporary primary sources as its basis, in particular specialist music journals as well as musical comment made in non-specialist papers and magazines. Using these sources to highlight recurrent tropes and to identify ways in which public comment around music changed throughout the course of the war, I identify particularly significant features of wartime musical discourse. The war prompted some musicians in Britain to re-evaluate their position with regard to German music. Since Britain was Germany's enemy, many commentators saw newfound opportunities for British music and musicians, in composition and in performance. Wartime conditions prompted a reconsideration of music's role and relevance, and a significant amount of time and public comment was invested in proving that musical activity was both practical and justifiable. Debate during the war concentrated on both investigating and proving the various uses to which music could be put, including therapeutic ones. My findings show that musicians found many ways to justify their activities during a time of violent conflict. The musical needs of serving troops were discussed and addressed by musicians based in Britain, with widespread recognition that music was of value as recreation and for entertainment, both in rest camps and in the front line, with many musicians travelling to provide music to troops and writing commentary on their experiences in British publications. In this context I demonstrate how notions of taste and discrimination, related to the concept of cultural capital and the dominant class as theorised by Pierre Bourdieu, can be applied to both those who wished to maintain traditional boundaries relating to dominant taste, and those for whom the war caused a temporary reassessment of their position with regard to popular culture or the wishes and tastes of serving troops. Lastly, I note that music and musicians were mobilised in the service of charitable enterprise, both being asked to give their skills in the cause of others, and being the reason for the formation of charitable organisations which benefited both performers and audiences alike. The war challenged British musicians working within art musical fields to justify their activities at a time of national tragedy and armed conflict, and these challenges, increasingly as the war progressed, resulted in an attitude of confidence. For some this confidence was a belief, not shared by all commentators, that British compositions could bear comparison with the best of music from other countries (and particularly Germany). This study concludes that, although art music was and remained a minority interest, the particular conditions of wartime provided temporarily increased audiences and gave a fillip of confidence, engendered by experiences and observations during the war, to those whose livelihoods were bound up in the art-musical sphere, a confidence which persuaded them that there was a continuing place for those activities. The wartime uses, reception and experience of art music demonstrated to practitioners, as well as to commentators and observers outside the sphere of music, that music had a practical as well as an emotional role to play in supporting the war effort, and inspired hopes that this recognition of music's importance would continue after the war.",0
Selected Russian Classical Romances and Traditional Songs for Young Singers: Introductory Materials with Teaching Strategies,"The purpose of this research is to assemble a collection of Russian Art song repertoire selected for beginner level training, with an exposition of the criteria for their appropriateness as teaching pieces. This examination defines the scope of vocal,  technical, language and interpretive abilities required for the performance of Russian Art song literature. It also establishes the need for a pedagogical approach that is free from Eurocentric cultural biases against Russian language and culture. Intended as a reference for teachers and students to simplify the introduction of Russian Art song into the repertoire of the advanced secondary or beginning undergraduate student, it includes a discussion of learning priorities and challenges particular to native English speakers relative to successful Russian language lyric diction assimilation, with solutions. This study is designed to furnish material for a published edition of songs in the appropriate transpositions for high, medium and low voice including word-for- word and sense translations with IPA transcriptions, along with program notes for each piece. Repertoire is selected from the works of Alyab'yev, Gurilyov, Varlamov, Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, as well as a few folk songs. The repertoire is grouped by difficulty and accompanied by English translations, interpretive analyses of the Russian Language poetry, and International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions modified for lyric diction. The degrees of difficulty are determined by vocal registration demands, word lengths and rhythmical text setting, as well as the incidences of unfamiliar phonological processes and complex consonant clusters occurring in the text. A scope and sequence chart is included, supplemented with learning objectives and teaching strategies, which organizes the repertoire according the order in which the pieces are to be taught. A palatalization guide is provided, to provide solutions for common pronunciation problems. Included in the appendices are listings of additional recommended Russian art song titles and recommended listening and viewing.",0
Church liturgy and catechesis: a critical examination of liturgical development in its relationship to catechesis in the modern catholic church,"Why this study now? As the Catholic Church advances through the twenty first century it continues to be deeply influenced by the great legacy of its previous pontiff Pope John Paul II (1920- 2005). This legacy includes his championing of a new evangelisation; the pivotal role that he gave to catechesis in this process and his desire to eliminate unacceptable departures from liturgical norms. Recalling his own words at the Congress of Liturgical Commissions (1984) Pope John Paul II stated: In the work of liturgical renewal, desired by the Council, it is necessary to keep in mind ""with great balance the part of God and the part of man, the hierarchy and the faithful, tradition and progress, the law and adaptation, the individual and the community, silence and choral praise. Thus the Liturgy on earth will fuse with that of heaven, where ... it will form one choir ... to praise with one voice the Father through Jesus Christ"" (Vicesimus Quintus Annos #23). The words of Pope John Paul II call for a liturgical perspective which is characterised by moderation and an appreciation of the eschatological dimension of the sacred liturgy. Through his liturgical writings, Pope John Paul II sought to be a corrective voice in trying to ensure universal fidelity to the liturgical law. This is exemplified in his exposition of the centrality of the Eucharist in the life of the Church in Ecclesia de Eucharistia (2003), a work that was intended to remedy the liturgical ‘abuses’ that had become apparent in the Church’s worship. It is acknowledged here that the word ‘abuse’ carries connotations associated with offenses of a moral nature. Turner (2012), expresses caution about an overuse of the word ‘abuses’ in the context of how the Church prays and the manner in which the sacred mysteries are celebrated (p,169). In this discussion on the liturgy (and throughout this thesis) the word ‘abuse’ is applied in a technical manner to describe 2 significant departures from liturgical norms which falsify and damage the Church’s liturgy as well as the tradition and authority of the Church in relation to public worship 1 In Ecclesia de Eucharistia Pope John Paul II recognises the positive signs of Eucharistic faith and then he refers to “the shadows” (#10) identifying these as the abandonment of Eucharistic adoration and also those unorthodox liturgical practices which resulted in confusion and a weakened understanding of liturgy: It is my hope that the present Encyclical Letter will effectively help to banish the dark clouds of unacceptable doctrine and practice, so that the Eucharist will continue to shine forth in all its radiant mystery (#10). Redemptionis Sacramentum seeks to develop a deeper appreciation of the value of liturgical norms so that the whole Church, Bishops, Priests, Deacons and lay faithful can carry them out according to their responsibility. There is also recognition of a clear link between the liturgy of the Church and its faith and the use of unapproved rites, texts or practices damages this link. The use of the word ‘banish’ in the words cited above is interesting since it denotes a dramatic and immediate attempt to dispel rather than a gradual elimination or negotiation. This communicates the urgency and the level of concern about the unacceptable practices that have obscured the Eucharistic celebration. In Spiritus et Sponsa (2003), in observance of the fortieth anniversary of Sacrosanctum Concilium, Pope John Paul II reflects on the degree to 1 The Instruction from the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship Redemptionis Sacramentum (2004) states: “Certainly the liturgical reform inaugurated by the Council has greatly contributed to a more conscious, active and fruitful participation in the Holy Sacrifice of the Altar on the part of the faithful” (#4). Even so, “shadows are not lacking”(10). In this regard it is not possible to be silent about the abuses, even quite grave ones, against the nature of the Liturgy and the Sacraments as well as the tradition and the authority of the Church, which in our day not infrequently plague liturgical celebrations in one ecclesial environment or another (11). Whenever an abuse is committed in the celebration of the sacred Liturgy, it is to be seen as a real falsification of Catholic Liturgy (171). Among the various abuses there are some which are objectively graviora delicta or otherwise constitute grave matters, as well as others which are nonetheless to be carefully avoided and corrected. 3 which the spirit and liturgical mandate outlined in Sacrosanctum Concilium has been implemented by the Church. Pope John Paul’s ""chirograph"" on sacred music, in observance of the 100th anniversary of Pope Saint Pius X's document on the same subject, Tra le sollecitudini (1903), was also intended “to offer the Church practical guidelines in that vital section of the liturgy…presenting a juridical code of sacred music” (#1) In all of these writings his deep concern for the sacred liturgy is clearly evident. Pope John Paul II’s successor to the See of Peter, Pope Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger), has continued and developed this focus on the centrality of the liturgy in the life of the Church, although he has approached the matter from a different perspective. Benedict is a prolific writer on liturgical matters and the dominant focus of his work on the liturgy is to establish an understanding of its objective nature. As the current pontiff he is leading the Church into the twenty first century during what is a challenging and also a privileged time. The English speaking world is both cautiously and eagerly undertaking the implementation of the new translation of the Roman Missal (Advent 2011) - a process which will continue to require significant and sustained programmes of Liturgical Formation and Liturgical Catechesis over several years. At this stage in its history the Catholic Church faces various other concurrent pastoral and liturgical challenges in terms of dwindling congregations, a diminishing number of priests and what some perceive to be a widening of the perceived gap between the Church and people in the context of a dramatically changed social landscape (Taylor 2007, p513-516). Despite these massive societal and ecclesial changes and their sometimes pernicious effects, (or perhaps because of them), there is also a sense that the Church is entering a vital and exciting era in liturgical and catechetical development. 4 The major themes of this thesis are ‘Church’, ‘Liturgy’ and ‘Catechesis’ from which an associated secondary theme of Liturgical Formation emerged. Part of the discussion will explore the relationship between these various elements. The current relevance of this study comes from three main sources. Firstly, the Pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI is signalling a new phase in the life of the Roman Catholic Church where sociological influences, ecclesial concerns, catechetical endeavour and a liturgical agenda are meeting and interacting. His pontificate is producing a creative synthesis leading the Church into a new stage in the organic development of the sacred liturgy and the result is prolific liturgical homilies and writings. Pope Benedict XVI’s papacy is characterised by a desire to ensure a deeper understanding of the essence of liturgy coupled with a leadership which demonstrates a reforming zeal for the sacred liturgy. At the centre of the pontiff’s vision to restore the liturgy (as expressed in The Spirit of the Liturgy), is a belief that a deeper understanding of, and fidelity to, its objective nature, will help to restore reverence and beauty in the celebration of sacred rites (2000, p9). He also insists on fidelity to the authentic vision of liturgical renewal expressed by the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council (2000, p, 8; p,171).",0
"Piano lessons in the english country house, 1785-1845","Two largely unexplored collections form the basis for research on the significance of piano lessons in the country homes of the British elite in the years around 1800. The owners of the music libraries were the Egerton family at Tatton Park, Cheshire and the Aclands of Killerton House, Devon. The women who married into these families, along with their children, form casestudies that stretch the boundaries of domestic amateur music-making, within an overlooked area of English keyboard repertoire. The piano was emerging as the ideal instrument for girls and women in the home, and this study examines the instruments at their disposal, providing substantial new information on the important Broadwood grand that belonged to Lydia Hoare Acland. Teachers, pupils and pedagogical tools cast light on the transition from a girl’s polite pastime to an emerging school of excellence, and this thesis examines, in detail, the practice of preluding in the education of Elizabeth Sykes Egerton, placing it against the broader background of women’s instruction in the ‘science of music’. The repertoire in the two family collections is a huge, multi-layered resource that adds colour to the outlines of early piano pedagogy, and exemplifies a breadth of skill across three or four generations. In this thesis, I place these important printed music collections in the context of additional contemporary sources, including diaries, memoirs, manuscript music and a commonplace book. Considering these collections in this wider arena, not only reveals a rich picture of early piano pedagogy, but also yields insights into the lives of the individuals who bought and used music for performance, study and sociability.",0
A study of two organ chorale preludes of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) transcribed by Wilhelm Kempff (1895-1991),"Wilhelm Kempff was one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century, and his interpretation of Germanic piano literature has been honored in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America by many distinguished musicians and music-lovers.  But perhaps because he was already sixty-nine years old at the time of his American debut in New York in 1964, his reputation as a pianist tends to be disregarded in English speaking nations.  Even Alfred Brendel acknowledges in his book Me of All People: ""I return again and again to Kempff, because he is a pianist who seems frequently underestimated today.""  Furthermore, Kempff's activities as a transcriber, organist, and composer are even less well known.  Thus this paper will introduce Wilhelm Kempff's life and music, and present a study of his solo piano transcriptions of J. S. Bach's chorale preludes for organ.     In Kempff's autobiographical novel, Unter Dem Zimbelstern: Das Werden eines Musikers (""Under the Cymbal Star: The Development of a Musician""), a Bildungsroman (""education novel"") published in 1951 when he was fifty-six years old, he describes the environment in which he grew up: an environment steeped in music and Protestantism.  Within a strong family tradition of church music organists, he heard Bach's organ repertoire, as well as conversations about Lutheran faith.  His father and paternal grandfather were both Lutheran church organists, and Kempff too was an excellent organist.  J. S. Bach's organ repertoire, especially his chorale for organ, were deeply ingrained in Kempff's childhood.  It is generally very difficult to find sacred music repertoire for the piano; however, Kempff's transcriptions of the chorale preludes represent a small—though important—contribution of sacred literature to the piano repertoire.       In The Pianist's Guide to Transcriptions, Arrangements, and Paraphrases, Maurice Hinson characterizes Kempff's transcriptions as follows:  ""Kempff makes clear distinctions between the various parts and uses ingenious fingering to create beautiful legato (without relying totally on the pedal).  He also seems to enjoy the interplay of tone colors, finding the right register, and establishing the particular timbre of each part in polyphonic writing.""  This paper will examine: 1) basic transcription techniques; 2) coloration/timbre; 3) fingering to create beautiful legato; 4) pedaling; and 5) pedagogical suggestions.       Kempff transcribed eight of Bach Chorales for solo piano, two of which will be discussed in this paper:  1) Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ (""I call to you, Lord Jesus Christ"" BWV639,); 2) Nun Komm der Heiden Heiland (""The Saviour of the Heathen now comes,"" BWV659a).  This paper also will present a brief history of piano transcriptions, followed by a detailed analysis of the two chorales, examining Kempff's methods through comparison with the original works for organ, and demonstrating how Kempff's musicianship as a pianist and organist is reflected in his Bach transcriptions.",0
Instruments for new music: Sound technology and modernism in the Weimar Republic,"Germany during the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) was the epicenter of an explosion of activity around the question of new instruments and their role in modern music. From the mid-1920s until the fall of the Republic—and for a time even under the National Socialist regime—composers, inventors, and musicologists alike were transfixed by the prospect of the technological rejuvenation of music. But this aspect of the Weimar Republic's musical life remains virtually unknown to historians, especially in the English-speaking world. Due to the relative dearth of surviving musical artifacts—scores, recordings, and even instruments themselves—the history of this milieu must be reconstructed on the basis of the period's rich documentary evidence. Through readings of primary sources such as journal articles, books, pamphlets, and patent papers, this dissertation explores the phenomenon of what I call musical ""technomodernism"" through case studies of three different technological constellations: mechanical instruments, such as the Welte-Mignon player piano; electric instruments, exemplified by the inventions of Jörg Mager; and ""media instruments"" such as optical sound film, in which recording media were re-functioned as experimental sound sources. Combining descriptions of the relevant instrumental technologies with explications of the aesthetic debates about the ""new music,"" this study aims to establish the historical significance of a distinctive and influential movement in twentieth-century music. The dissertation further investigates the period's influences on later discourses and practices of music, technology, and instrumentality, particularly as they manifest in the tradition that has come to be known as ""electronic music.""",0
'N Voorligtingsprogram Vir Postkonkussie-pasiënte,"A review of existing relevant literature and research confirms that there is not always unanimity about the diagnosis and classification of the Post-concussion syndrome (PCS). This controversy arising from the diagnosis results in the failure to inform, prepare and equip the patient and his family adequately for the effects of PCS. This influences the treatment and eventual rehabilitation of a patient who has a light head injury.It is, therefore, essential that the medical field, over the whole spectrum of medical disciplines, should fully understand PCS and the patient, and should also provide the patient's support system with the necessary information with regard to the effects of PCS. This will, in truth, affect the rehabilitation of this patient.An investigation of the literature showed that most light head injuries are the result of road accidents, followed by industrial and factory accidents. Other types of head injuries and alcohol abuse play a further role in the appearance and degree of seriousness of light head injuries.The effect of PCS symptoms range from physical discomforts such as headaches to more emotional problems such as depression, fatigue, anxiety and concentration problems. Primary symptoms fade with the passing of time while secondary symptoms increase after the first few months after the head injury. The experience of PCS symptoms can be influenced by different factors such as pre-trauma personality traits, accident neurosis and compensations. It is postulated that the experience of typical PCS symptoms can be mediated by sufficient understanding, knowledge and realistic expectations on the part of the light head injured patient.The aim of the study was to address the problem of insufficient information provided to patients suffering from PCS regarding the symptoms they are likely to suffer. This was done by creating a post-trauma information program consisting of an attractive and multicoloured booklet with easy access to various issues such as explanation of terminology, the neurology of concussion, likely symptoms, prognosis and recovery time. The booklet was complemented with a casette recording of relevant issues, presented in different voices, with a calming musical background.The patients who were selected to participate in the evaluation of the program had all presented at the 1 Military Hospital over a period of 18 months with firmly diagnosed PCS based on scores obtained on the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). A total of 81 white, male subjects were selected. All the subjects complied with certain criteria such as Afrikaans or English language proficiency, falling within a particular age group (16 - 35 years) and with no prior neurological or psychiatric disease.The 81 patients were randomly divided into groups according to the Solomon fourgroup design. Pre tests were administered to the two experimental groups. The pre tests consisted of four subscales of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and four subscales of the Personal, Home, Social and Formal Relations Questionnaire (PHSF). The validities and reliabilities of these scales are wel documented. The four selected POMS subscales were:",0
"Marcella Craft and opera in Riverside, California, 1932-57","American soprano Marcella Craft (1874-1959), after receiving musical training in Riverside, California, moved to Boston in 1895, where she studied voice and sang professionally. In 1900 she moved to Europe, focusing principally on opera, first in theaters in small cities in Italy and then in larger houses in Germany, particularly in Kiel, Mainz, and Munich. Craft's career was notable on multiple accounts: as one of Richard Strauss's favorite interpreters of the title role in his opera Salome and for her championing of the work in the United States, for her performance in the U.S. premiere of Mahler's Symphony No. 4, and for her extensive American recital career and her appearances with the San Carlo Opera. Following her retirement from opera and concert performance in the early 1930s, she returned to Riverside, where, at the height of the Depression, she founded the Riverside Opera Association, one of California's first community-based opera programs. From 1932-57, Craft successfully directed her company in 49 operas in 72 productions, including programs of opera scenes, and 202 performances over sixteen seasons.    Craft's company's success was secured by her high reputation and international career, her status as Riverside's most famous native daughter, her forceful personality and skills as an opera director and producer, the support of prominent community leaders and organizations (including Riverside Junior College and the Mission Inn), the comparatively large local pool of trained vocal talent, and the receptivity and support of local audiences. Craft's pragmatic approach to producing European opera on a regular basis where it had not existed consistently before, and her understanding of the need to reach out to local and regional audiences by performing the standard European works in English, contributed to the success and longevity of her company. The history of the Riverside Opera Association can serve as a case study for the creation and maintenance of an operatic culture within a developing provincial urban environment and the cultivation of American public acceptance for opera.",0
Crossing Stories: Circulating Citizenships in an Américas du Golfe,"My dissertation makes two scholarly interventions. First, it locates New Orleans as a cultural and cartographic heart linking the Caribbean, the United States, and Latin America into what I call Américas du Golfe. It traces flows of cultures and citizens(hips) through New Orleans and across national borders: physically, culturally, economically, visually, linguistically, and musically, challenging traditional nation-based scholarly frameworks, and reorienting New Orleans as a Gulf, rather than American, city. Second, it focuses on the idea of ""the archive,"" to ask how  the forms of information we acquire and weave into academic narratives reflect who becomes a protagonist in those stories—and who doesn't. I argue that ""alternative"" archives of art, photography, performance, oral history and music expose complex racial and cultural memories historically silenced, by and about people of color, women, and children.    The lives of the people in this dissertation represent an anomaly only in traditional methodologies, which still hew to monolingual, nationalistic, and often regional approaches. When rethinking the space between Cuba, Haiti, New Orleans and Veracruz as what I call the Américas du Golfe , I illuminate Golfe norms: peoples, cultures, and families built across the waters of the Golfe, of the Mississippi, and of the City of New Orleans. The storied city of stories, New Orleans becomes a central capital circulating people, culture, languages, and performances, which offer alternative archives and alternative understandings of identity across the nineteenth century. This dissertation is closer kin to a scrapbook than a history book. It is neither an exhaustive nor conclusive monograph of a region, but rather, a layered, visual, tactile and intimate set of images that raises the dead to raise questions about the living, presenting relationships, memory-formation and community that speak to an era without claiming to speak for it.    Chapter one introduces the ""Américas du Golfe,"" communities of peoples, thoughts, and ideas that formed across the  Golfe du México during the nineteenth century. By twining geographic region to water, I shift the ""imagined community"" of the  Golfe from man-made legal borders to natural community formation that occurred through shared culture, experience, and history. Chapters 2 and 3 follow the Tios, French-speaking Creole gens du couleur who move to Eureka Colony in Mexico directly before the American Civil War. Their story poleaxes traditional narratives of the United States as the land of opportunities. The final circulated around the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition of 1884 and reiterate questions of the performance of identity across the Golfe. I travel with the family of Francisco Vargas, Mexican craftsmen, who establish themselves by defining ""authentic New Orleans"" with wax figures of Creole and African American characters, revealing the complexity of flowing identity across the Golfe, as they engage with a pan-Spanish New Orleans community. I then turn to ""The Mexican Band,"" who arrives for the Exposition and instigates the largest Spanish language sheet music explosion in the United States in the nineteenth century, which helped shape the formation of the most ""American"" of music, jazz. The last chapter reflects on perhaps the most overlooked body of all, the environmental body of the Gulf of Mexico. The Golfe is the body always present, always sought, always violated and doing violence across the  Américas du Golfe. How can we imagine a community based around a non-sovereign body, a body of water? What does it mean, to New Orleans, and to American Studies more broadly, to consider the body of the Gulf as an archival body?    In teasing out the formation of Golfe communities, this dissertation returns to a second question: whom do we remember, how, and why? Who gets buried in the swamp, bodies pushed out of sight under the canopy of history? How can we become scholarly explorers who enter the bog and search for preserved remains?1 Remembering is an exercise to keep the memory of an event alive, writes Gulf poet Natasha Trethewey. 2 I hope this project will meditate on the ways we remember and point to the violence that continues to be enacted when we forget, ignore, or refuse to look for agency and archives outside of traditional literature and history. I hope this does not become New Orleans' story, but rather points to the obvious: that New Orleans has many stories, many still buried in the swamp, covered in mosquitoes, and itching to be dragged onto solid land and exposed as part of the landscape of memories that makes the Crescent City the beloved and beleaguered city that it is.    1 In addition to above, I suggest donning a funny hat. I feel all good explorers seem to have them. 2 Natasha Trethewey, ""Our Loss, Through the Eye of the Storm,"" The New York Times, August 29, 2010.",0
“Musick's Handmaid”: Class Mobility in English Women's Keyboard Music Through Handel,"From the late 1660s through the 1730s a confluence of political, social, and economic events in England fostered the emergence of a mostly urban middle class, with the largest population centered in London. With an eye toward social advancement through advantageous marriage, middle class families often sent their daughters to boarding schools that offered curricula focusing on the ""female arts,"" skills that would enhance a young woman's desirability as a marriage partner. Chief among these skills was music making, particularly the ability to play the keyboard.    The sheer volume of music publications seemingly aimed at women demonstrates the widespread attraction keyboard playing held for them during this time. Through an examination of keyboard music published from 1663 to 1739, this thesis will show that middle class women were a commanding consumer force for the first half of this period, with the needs and tastes of a largely self-taught population dictating the content of the most prevalent keyboard publications, collection books consisting of popular tunes and elementary keyboard suites in the French style. It will also show that by 1700 the middle class female's influence on keyboard music began to wane, eventually giving way to that of upper class females, whose superior skills afforded them the ability to play far more intellectually and technically demanding collections of dance suites. This shift from middle to upper class domination would escalate dramatically after the publication of George Frederick Handel's Suites de Pièces pour le Clavecin in 1720, resulting not only in even greater technical difficulty, but also a move to the Italian style.",0
Vytautas Barkauskas and his contribution to the viola literature,"The present document introduces prominent Lithuanian composer Vytautas Barkauskas and his works written for viola. The author believes that an exceptional composer such as Barkauskas deserves to be known by more musicians. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to encourage interest in Barkauskas and his music for viola. Additionally, since published information about the composer and his compositions is scarce, especially in languages other than Lithuanian, the study is a valuable source about Barkauskas and his works for viola for English speaking musicians who would like to know about the composer.    The first chapter introduces Barkauskas’ biography, accomplishments and compositional style. The other three chapters present his works written for or including the viola. The second chapter examines the only piece for unaccompanied viola, the third chapter presents two works written for viola with orchestra, and the fourth chapter discusses two groups of Barkauskas’ chamber works that include viola. The first group includes two pieces with a more exposed viola part and the second group includes six chamber pieces with a more equal role.    The study includes information about compositional and performance characteristics of Barkauskas’ works for viola, written from the viewpoint of a performer, and hopefully will be a useful contribution to performing violists.",0
“Voices of Boys”: The Influence of Britten's <i>Missa Brevis in D</i> on his <i> War Requiem</i>,"Benjamin Britten's War Requiem of 1963 is a distinct monument in his career as a composer. Drawing largely on his own earlier music and works by other composers as sources for material, the piece has been described as ""encyclopedic"" As such, it testifies to Britten's matured skill and craft as a composer, much in the same way the B-Minor Mass relates to J. S. Bach.    Many of the sources for the War Requiem are fairly obvious; for instance, Britten's Canticle II: Abraham and Isaac is quoted directly in the Offertorium as 'The Parable of the Old Man and the Young;"" it also provides the material for the fugue on ""Quam olim Abrahae promisisti"" surrounding the ""Parable."" Analysts have noted associations between the militaristic fanfares of the Dies irae of the War Requiem, Britten's quintessential pacifist work, and those of earlier political pieces, including the Ballad of Heroes and Our Hunting Fathers, as well as the unavoidable connection to the Dies irae of his Sinfonia da Requiem. Critics have also been quick to point out similarities between the War Requiem and Verdi's Requiem.    Little attention, however, has been paid to the relationship between the War Requiem and Britten's only other mass, the Missa Brevis in D, despite their having been written concurrently. A comparison of the two works illuminates striking similarities with respect to motifs, melodies, harmony, form, texture, style, and text setting.    The paper unfolds in two sections. In the first part, a case will be made that the Missa Brevis may have been a model for sections of the War Requiem, particularly the four sections written for boys' voices. This relationship will be demonstrated through analysis and examination of secondary sources.    The second part of the paper concerns the hermeneutical significance of the Missa Brevis as a source through which passages in the War Requiem may be interpreted in a new light. Of particular interest is music borrowed from the Missa Brevis, incorporated into sections for boys' voices in the War Requiem, and then further re-contextualized in English-language tropes of the War Requiem. By considering the new context of this borrowed material, the English texts take on new, often ironic, meaning.",0
"Dengbêj, Mullah, intelligentsia: The survival and revival of the Kurdish-Kurmanji language in the Middle East, 1925–1960","This dissertation examines the history of the Kurdish language from 1925 through the late 1950s. The study is limited to the northern dialect of the Kurdish language known as Kurmanji. The original question underlying this study is as follows: in the newly shaped post- World War I Middle East where the prevailing “international political norm” is nation-states, in the absence of a nation-state imposing Kurdish-Kurmanji as an official language, what actors kept this language alive, revivified it, and transmitted it? Based on the available and accessible oral and written sources, this study argues that oral poets called dengbêjs, mullahs educated in madrasas and Western-educated intelligentsia played crucial roles in the historical transmission of Kurdish-Kurmanji. While the prohibition and criminalization of speaking and publishing in Kurdish turns the story of this language in Turkey into one of “survival”, its history may be called one of “revival” by the Western-educated intelligentsia based in Syria, Lebanon and Soviet Armenia.   This study focuses on the following personalities: Dengbêj Reso (d. 1983), Khalifa Yusuf (1885-1965), Cegerxwîn (1903-1984), Celadet Bedirkhan (1893-1951), Kamuran Bedirkhan (1895-1978) and the Yezidi-Kurdish “generation of orphans” in the Soviet Armenia, namely; Qanatê Kurdo (1909-1985), Emînê Evdal (1906-1964), Heciyê Cindî (1908-1992) and Casimê Celîl (1908-1998). As Kurdish “hidden transcripts”, the oral poetry of dengbêjs is characterized by its communication of sentiments. Mullahs, on the other hand, are engaged with the spread of knowledge among the Kurds in order to bring national emancipation in this world and salvation in both worlds. In comparison with the dengbêjs and mullahs, the Western-educated intelligentsia is the most publicly and politically visible category as they have been in collaboration with and/or opposition to states and colonial powers in the region. The defining characteristic of Kurdish intelligentsia, for purposes of this study, is their engagement with the project of making up a written, literary standard Kurdish language. These three categories present complicated and even contradictory visions of Kurdishness revealed within a common linguistic and historical universe.    The primary sources used in this study mainly fall into three categories: archival documents (the Turkish Republican Archives in Ankara and French Diplomatic Archives in Nantes), the Kurdish press from the 1930s and 1940s ( Hawar, Ronahî, Roja Nû and Riya Teze) and sound recordings of dengbêjs. The outstanding methodological characteristic of this study is its unconventional use of sound recordings as a historical source in a reconstruction of modern Kurdish history. The fundamental methodological claim of this dissertation is that one must listen to dengbêjs as the Kurdish “voice of the past” in order to analyze Kurdish society, culture and history on its own terms. Hence, the three audio files of Dengbêj Reso’s songs are the essential and constitutive source for this study. They are not appended; they are part of the body of the dissertation.    This study offers several significant contributions to the existing scholarship on the modern Middle East in general and modern Turkey and Kurdish history in particular. First and foremost, it approaches Kurdish history through its own language. By its engagement with Kurdish history through the history of the language, this study challenges the predominant focus on the Kurds from within the framework of politics and the history of nationalism. Therefore, the focus on the language provides a more human touch in contrast to the top-down political as well as academic perspectives characterizing the Kurds solely as agents of tribal, religious and national politics. Likewise, this study underlines the agency of the mostly rural dengbêjs and mullahs alongside the Western-educated urban intelligentsia. With their alternative modes of orality/literacy as opposed to the standardized literacy of the intelligentsia, dengbêjs and mullahs have been active agents in the historical transmission of the Kurdish-Kurmanji language in their own ways. Alongside highlighting the agency of dengbêjs and mullahs, this study also demonstrates that children were active agents in the revival of the Kurdish language. Hence, these agencies bring us to a more accurate picture of Kurdish history which has been written primarily through the experiences of the Western-educated male urban intelligentsia. Lastly, this study is a contribution to the social history of modern Turkey as it contributes to rewriting the history of the period under consideration from the perspective of the criminalized Kurdish language as transmitted by dengbêjs and mullahs.",0

Political identity of first-year college students: An analysis of student characteristics using Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) data,"This quantitative study utilized secondary self-reported data from the 2008 administration of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) Freshman Survey from two Texas public universities to investigate the pre-college demographic, academic, attitude, behavioral, and familial factors that may relate to students’ self-reported political identities. The study design was correlational regarding the relationship of the demographic, academic, attitude, behavioral, and familial independent variables to the dependent variable of the students’ political identities. ANOVA main effects for the independent variables were calculated, and statistical significance required the p<.05 level. <p>   The statistically significant demographic factors were native English-speaking status; enrollment status; citizenship status; religious preference; and race. The statistically significant academic factor was intended major. The statistically significant attitude factors were opinions regarding social issues such as criminal rights; abortion rights; the death penalty; the legalization of marijuana; homosexual relationships and same-sex marriage; racial discrimination; income taxes; affirmative action; military spending and voluntary military service; gun control; the environment; national health care; immigration; personal success; political dissent; and free speech. Other statistically significant attitude factors related to personal goals of making artistic and scientific contributions; being politically influential and politically knowledgeable; raising a family; participating in environmental programs and community action programs; developing a life purpose; promoting racial understanding; and promoting cultural understanding. The statistically significant behavioral factors were the frequency with which students participated in activities such as attending religious services; smoking; feeling overwhelmed or depressed; playing a musical instrument; discussing politics; and being involved in political campaigns. Other statistically significant behavioral factors were the frequency with which students participated in critical thinking activities such as using logical arguments to support their opinions; seeking alternative solutions to problems; researching scientific articles; exploring topics of personal interest; and accepting mistakes. The statistically significant familial factors were the religious preferences of the students’ fathers and mothers.    The results can give insight into the political characteristics of the students with whom student affairs professionals work. They can be used to inform the planning and implementation of educational programs that aid in students’ political identity development.",0
Expressive art therapy for autistic children--autistic children from an education center for autistic children in xiamen for the study,"Translation from original language as provided by authorExpressive art therapy is that through music, dance, drama, visual arts and other forms or media as a tool of psychological treatment modalities. Although in recent years there has been some academic researchers into this topic(Expressive art therapy, including music therapy, dance therapy, drama therapy, art therapy, etc.),very few of expressive art therapy as an intervention approach to treatment for autistic children. In view of today's increasingly common phenomenon of autistic children, this study try to use expressive art therapy as an intervention approach for treatment of autistic children. The researcher selected six autistic children from an education center for autistic children in Xiamen for the study, and applied expressive art therapy, to promote the rehabilitation of autistic children. The study mainly include the following aspects: The first part is theoretical scope of subjects. It introduced the meaning and impact of the multiple intelligences theory; the diagnosis and identification,characteristics and causes of autistic children; the goals and skills of music therapy, dance therapy, drama therapy and visual art therapy. The second part is the main study, The researcher through access to a large number of Chinese and English literature, work closely with parents, the center teachers ,and select the six autistic children as the research object, the application of autism ABC scale to assess with autism psychological development of children and characteristics, under the guidance of the multiple intelligences theory, formulate expressive art therapy program and to carry out expressive art therapy, followed by the experimental results carried out a qualitative and quantitative analysis. Part three is conclusion and prospects.

Finally put forward recommendations and principles accordingly. Expressive art therapy can be applied and extended to the children's area, the field of adolescent, adult field, the field of the",0
High school students' perceptions of the inclusion of multicultural education in a suburban school district,"The purpose of this study was to examine high school students’ perceptions of multiculturalism in their schools related to ethnicity, gender, and culture. This study used a cross-sectional sample of students from all grade levels in a high school to examine their perceptions multiculturalism in their school and community to determine if these perceptions differed by grade, gender, and ethnicity of the students.    A total of 301 students completed the survey that was adapted from a questionnaire developed by the Dade County Florida School District. The survey measured six subscales: multicultural relationships, actions of multiculturalism, awareness of multiculutralism, skills of multicultural education, student interactions, and ethnic isolation. The instrument was tested for validity and reliability, with alpha coefficients ranging from .78 to .83. The students ranged in age from 14 to 17 years, with a median housheold income of $46,976. The majority of students were African American (73.8%), with European Americans (22.4%) comprising the second largest group. Participants indicated that students from all ethnic groups were included in athletics, music programs, and clubs. They were generally positive about the inclusion of different ethnic groups in their class discussions (especially in social studies and English 152 classes). Less involvement was noted for the inclusion of different ethnic groups in their textbooks.    Results of the study indicated that students generally were positive regarding their perceptions of multicultural education on the six subscales. Females appeared to have more positive perceptions than male students and ninth grade students had more positive perceptions than eleventh and twelfth grade students. The ninth grade students were completing social study classes that were intended to provide information on different ethnic groups and cultures around the world.    Based on findings of this study, students in the targeted school were aware of and accepting of cultural differences among their classmates. Additional research is needed to continue to research multiculturalism in high schools and communities.",0
The effects of group improvisational music therapy on depression in adolescents and adults with substance abuse,"The effect of group improvisational music therapy on depression in adolescents and adults with substance abuse was investigated. It was hypothesized that group improvisational music therapy would relieve depressive symptoms. Twenty-four Spanish-speaking patients receiving outpatient and inpatient treatment for substance abuse at Fundación José Felix Ribas (FJFR), located in Mérida State-Venezuela participated in the study. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) before being randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, each consisting of three cohort groups recruited over a nine month period. The experimental group received 12 group improvisation sessions over a three-month period, along with the standard treatment program provided at the facility, and the control group received only the standard treatment program. Post-test measures were completed at the end of each three-month treatment cycle. Differences between groups in pre-test and post-test scores were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Results showed that both groups were equally matched on all pretest measures. As for post-test measures, significant differences were found between the groups on HRSD, but not the BDI. The experimental group was significantly less depressed after treatment than the control group, as measured by the HRSD. Improvisational music therapy led to statistically significant greater improvements in psychologist-rated depression (HRSD) when compared to the regular treatment program alone; although no statistical differences were found in the improvements on the BDI between the two treatments, improvisational music therapy had a clinically significant effect. Possible explanations are offered. The most important limitations of the study were the small sample size, absence of a depression assessment tool specifically for substance abuse, and the use of the first version of the BDI instead of the second version as well as lack of information on demographic and clinical data.",0
An investigation of solo song settings of specific poetry written by children incarcerated in the Terezin concentration camp from 1942–1944,"After WWII, Hana Volavková, director of the Prague Jewish Museum, collected the artwork and poetry created by children incarcerated in the Terezin concentration camp north of Prague from 1941-1945, most of whom perished in Auschwitz. Many Czech Jewish intellectuals, artists, dramatists and musicians, such as Freida Dicker-Brandeis and Petr Kien, had been sent to Terezin. At the camp, a clandestine school for the education of children ages 5-14 was set up with the assistance of Jewish elders and administrators such as Jakub Edelstein and Gonda Redlich. In 1959, Volavková presented a collection of the children's artwork and poetry, which was published by Artia for Schocken Books in 1978 with an expanded edition in 1993 published with assistance from the U.S. Holocaust Museum. The text, I Never Saw Another Butterfly: Children's Drawings and Poems from Terezin Concentration Camp, 1942-1944, has provided a catalyst for English-speaking art song composers with emotional ties to the Holocaust.    Contemporary composers whose song cycles or oratorios use this poetry include: Ellwood Den (I Never Saw Another Butterfly); Srul Irving Glick (I Never Saw Another Butterfly); Gershon Kingsley (Three Songs from the Ghetto); Larry Zimmerman ( Windsongs); Lori Laitman (I Never Saw Another Butterfly); Ruth Lomon (Songs of Remembrance); Gayther Myers ( To the Child-Poets of Terezin); Ludek Drizhal (Two Voices from Terezin); and Ruth Fazal (Oratorio Terezin). An investigation of the most frequently set poems from Volavkovás collection by these composers revealed: The Butterfly by Pavel Friedmann (six settings, all are analyzed); The Garden by Franta Bass (four settings, two are analyzed); On a Sunny Evening anonymous (four settings, three are analyzed); To Olga by Alena Synková (three settings, two are analyzed); Birdsong anonymous (three settings, all are analyzed); and Terezin by Mif (three settings, one is analyzed). The analyses of these art song settings reveals a predilection for the combination of medium to high voice with reed instruments. Piano is used by four of the composers, orchestra by two and other instrumental combinations with voice by four. Compositional techniques range from folk-like homophonic verse to highly dissonant, motivically structured, polyphonic textures in sectionalized form.",0
Emergent learning: Three learning communities as complex adaptive systems,"In the 2007-2008 school year, the author conducted a collaborative case study (Stake, 2000) with the goal of discovering and describing ""emergent learning"" in three high school classrooms. Emergent learning, defined as the acquisition of new knowledge by an entire group when no individual member of the group possessed it before, is implied by the work of many theorists working on an educational analog of a natural phenomenon called a complex adaptive system.   Complex adaptive systems are well networked collectives of agents that are nonlinear, bounded and synergistic. The author theorized that classes that maximized the features of complex adaptive systems could produce emergent learning (a form of synergy), and that there was a continuum of this complexity, producing a related continuum of emergence. After observing a co-curricular jazz group, an English class, and a geometry class for most of one academic year, collecting artifacts and interviewing three students and a teacher from each class, the author determined that there was indeed a continuum of complexity.    He found that the actively complex nature of the Jazz Rock Ensemble produced an environment where emergence was the norm, with the ensemble producing works of music, new to the world, with each performance. The English section harnessed the chaotic tendencies of students to optimize cognitive dissonance and frequently produce emergent learning, while the mathematics section approached the learning process in a way that was too rigidly linear to allow detectable emergence to occur.",0
A research of schumann's piano cycle,"Translation from original language as provided by authorRobert Schumann,one of the most outstanding German composer of the Romantic era in the history of European musical culture, in the second half of the nineteenth century. He was not only a prominent critic and a courageous innovator, but also a great composer. He created many excellent musical works during his lifetime, particularly well known for his piano music and songs. As a very precious treasure in the piano literature, his piano cycles have a special characteristic of the structure. He bravely innovated his form of music,and promoted music to reflect real life, reflecting the character and personality psychology, and literature, poetry and music are closely linked, and it formed his own unique, life-like characteristics of Romantic art. ""The Scenes of childhood"" is one of the most outstanding piano cycles. The work showed an image of a child which full of imagination, hopes and aspirations, vividly displayed to people. The work shown that the memory of adult to the good old days of childhood, but also expressed nostalgia for the passing of childhood and the melancholy. ""The Scenes of childhood"" by Schumann, fully embodies the meticulous and the vivid image in his process of creative music, but also a reflection of his human nature, has an universal and eternal significance. In this essay, Robert Schumann's piano cycle, ""The Scenes of childhood"" is the main line, and discuessed from the start on three aspects. First of all, the understanding of Schumann's life and the study of the his musical creative process, helped readers to depth and detailed understanding of the cultural meaning of Schumann's work. Then, from the Harmony, music form,performance technique, and the detailed analysis of ""childhood scenes,"" to understand and grasp the intent of the creation, creative features, and performing skills. Finally,the author gave some enlightenments of teaching the piano by performing ""The Scenes of childhood"". In Conclusion part, the author summed up the achievements of Schumann in musical commentary and creation, as well as the contributions by Schumann made, for the romantic",0
The development of Alban Berg's compositional style: A study of his <i>Jugendlieder</i> (1901–1908),"This dissertation explores the compositional and stylistic development of Alban Berg (1885-1935), as demonstrated in his Jugendlieder,  two volumes containing 81 art songs composed between 1901 and 1908. The biographical and cultural context in which they were composed is explained, and each volume of song manuscripts is separately described with respect to poetic, rhythmic, formal, melodic, and harmonic elements. The first 34 songs (volume 1, 1901-1904) demonstrate Berg’s initial efforts to set German poetry to music. Due to his limited musical training and skill during these years, the earliest songs contain unconventional traits that would only be produced by a novice, but they also suggest that Berg modeled his compositions after nineteenth-century art songs, particularly those of Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms, which were performed in the family home by his siblings. Berg’s first love was literature, and it is therefore not surprising that illustrating the poetic images in the texts appears to have been his primary focus.    During the time when Berg composed the second volume of songs (1904-1908), he began to study music theory and composition with Arnold Schoenberg. As a result, the songs of the second phase reveal an improved understanding of tonality, chord function, and formal structure. The illustration of poetic topics, themes, and images remained a principal focus for Berg, but the texts were treated in a more subtle manner, allowing for the appearance of a greater concentration on musical devices. These songs implement exercises in variation techniques, rhythmic devices, chromaticism, and dissonance, pointing to the development of his personal style.    Ultimately, this study demonstrates that the Jugendlieder served as the foundation upon which Berg cultivated the skills needed to develop a mature compositional style that balanced Romantic conventions and modern practices.",0
"Practice and emptiness in the “Discourse Record of Ruru Jushi”, Yan Bing (d. 1212), a Chan Buddhist layman of the Southern Song","This dissertation is a study of the works of one Chinese Buddhist layman, Yan Bing, also known as Layman Ruru (Ruru jushi, d. 1212). His writings are extant in two editions, a handwritten manuscript of more than 400 pages, and a woodblock print of 121 pages. Herein we find a great wealth of primary material on Buddhist thought, culture, and practice in the Southern Song (1127–1279): essays on doctrine, morality, and meditation, written prayers and supplications, detailed ritual protocols, records of his formal Chan teachings, a complex diagram of the Buddhist cosmos, and essays and verses on the unity of the ""Three Teachings"" (Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism).    This study has two aims; the first is to introduce Yan Bing to the English-speaking scholarly community, which it accomplishes by presenting a substantial volume of transcriptions and translations from his corpus. The second is to understand the relationship between the doctrine of ""emptiness"" or ""nonduality"" on the one hand and ""conventional"" Buddhist morality and ritual piety on the other. Both of these religious orientations are well represented in Yan's works. As a second-generation dharma heir of Linji Chan Master Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163), he emphasizes meditation and huatou contemplation as the fastest solution to the problem of karma and rebirth. At the same time he strongly urges adherence to the Buddhist precepts, the cultivation of merit, and pursuit of rebirth in Amitabha Buddha's Pure Land.    The study proceeds through a careful examination of the relationship between one's store of karmic merit and the possibility of attaining ""sudden"" enlightenment; the various uses to which Yan applies the doctrine of nonduality in his preaching; and an extensive comparison with another Buddhist layman, the Pure Land devotee Wang Rixiu (d. 1173). We find that Yan understands ""conventional"" religiosity to support the pursuit of ultimate liberation, and that the specifics of different understandings of ""emptiness"" have a tangible impact on programs of practice.",0
Rhythmic structure in the music of Jean Guillou: “Agni-Ignis” from “Hyperion” (1988),"In 1988, Jean Guillou composed Hyperion on a commission from the French oil company, Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine, to celebrate its discovery of oil. He developed this theme of fire using his imagination, European philosophical concepts, and various myths. As with Messiaen, rhythm becomes a significant element in Guillou’s organ music to convey a heightened dramatic story of an exaltation of fire and to represent the fourth movement of ""Agni-Ignis.""    For aspects of rhythmic structure, I developed new methodology to analyze rhythm in six sections of ""Agni-Ignis."" Guillou uses experimental rhythmic techniques such as rhythmic subdivision, cycling, rhythmic ostinato, durational contrast, and rhythmic crescendo to build the musical structure of the piece. Among them, the primary subdivision of 16th-note groups organizes throughout the piece as a cyclic theme to convey the powerful and vivid mood of fire. This rhythmic group creates many pitch patterns as thematic transformation to provide both rhythmic and harmonic complexities. The two types of rhythmic ostinato, which is variable and invariable type, juxtapose below the manual’s skillful rhythm to provide variety and unity. The other notable features of rhythm appear at the border of each section, such as rhythmic crescendo, durational contrast, 32nd-note groupings, rest and fermata to build tension and relaxation. The rhetorical figure of pitch D, which is another “fire theme” in the pitch aspect dominates the core section which has a much slower rhythm with sustained notes. In general, Guillou has been influenced by his predecessors such as his teacher, Messiaen, and Stravinsky. However, he is uniquely suited to explore the limitless possibilities of the organ in a more secular and avant-garde style. The purpose of this study is to give the performer new insight to guide his or her performance.",0
"ION, opera in seven scenes, based on Euripides original play","The opera ION serves as my Doctoral Dissertation at the University of Maryland School of Music. The librettist of the opera is Nick Olcott, Opera Assistant Director at the University. My interest in this little-known play of Euripides began with my work with Professor Lillian Doherty of the University's Classics Department. Since I am fluent in Greek, I was able to read the play in original, becoming aware of nuances of meaning absent in the standard English translations. Professor Leon Major, Artistic Director of the University's Opera Studio, was enthusiastic about the choice of this play as the basis for an opera, and has been very generous of his time in showing me what must be done to turn a play into an opera.     ION is my first complete stage work for voices and constitutes an ambitious project. The opera is scored for a small chamber orchestra, consisting of Saxophone, Percussion (many types), Piano, a Small Chorus of six singers, as well as five Soloists. An orchestra of this size is adequate for the plot, and also provides support for various new vocal techniques, alternating between singing and speaking, as well as traditional arias.    In ION, I incorporate Greek folk elements, which I know first-hand from my Balkan background, as well as contemporary techniques which I have absorbed during my graduate work at Boston University and the University of Maryland.    Euripides' ION has fascinated me for two reasons in particular: its connection with founding myth of Athens, and the suggestiveness of its plot, which turns on the relationship of parents to children. In my interpretation, the leading character Ion is seen as emblematic for today's teenagers. Using the setting of the classic play, I hope to create a modern transformation of a myth, not to simply retell it. To this end, hopefully a new opera form will rise, as valid for our times as Verdi and Wagner were for theirs.",0
"<i>Los libros de acedrex dados e tablas</i>: Historical, artistic and metaphysical dimensions of Alfonso X's “Book of Games”","Combining three major facets of Alfonso's final and most personal work, this holistic study utilizes a philological approach involving codicology, hermeneutics, history of art, iconology, paleography, and philosophy. Like his Cantigas de Santa María, with its vast musical, poetic and artistic dimensions, the Book of Games is a largely unexplored multi-media treasure trove of knowledge about thirteenth-century games, art and symbolism as well as personal information about the Wise King himself. Chapter I explains the historical chess, dice, backgammon and mill games ands offers the first complete English translation of the Book.  Descriptions and diagrams of all 144 games, including PowerPoint presentations of all 103 chess problems using a font specially designed to match the original manuscript exactly, are presented in an international format which brings these challenging and entertaining games to life. Chapter II surveys all 151 illuminations, exploring their cultural value and identifying portraits of Alfonso, his wife, his lover, his children, his friends and his sources. Alongside traditional medieval iconography, these may represent some of the earliest known likenesses in medieval portraiture and some of the first private, non-iconographic images of a Spanish king. Chapter III interprets the literal, allegorical, tropological and anagogical meanings of each game according to the Hermetic principle ""As above, so below"" as well as the numerological symbolism and didactic structure reflected in the book's Scholastic structure. Each game in the Libro de los juegos contains a clue "" pora los entendudos e mayormientre pora aquellos que saben la Arte de Astronomia "" (fol. 95r) for understanding the connection between astrology and human affairs. At the end of his ill-starred life Alfonso saw reflected in the microcosm of these games, the determinism inherent in the workings of the universe. By studying the patterns in these games, Alfonso hoped to discover how best to play the game of life using both his ""seso,"" or skill, and his lucky number seven. The numerological and astrological significance of the numbers seven and twelve, present in the entire work's structure and especially the concluding games, relate the Book of Games to the Alfonsine legal, scientific and religious corpus.",0
The Pistoia choirbooks: An introduction to the sources and repertory,"Manuscripts C.119, C.120, and C.121 in the chapter archive of the Cathedral of San Zeno in Pistoia are well known to scholars for the beauty of their script and notation, as well as for the rich repertory of plainchant preserved in their folios. They have, however, received largely oblique treatment in the study of plainchant. The choirbooks have been cited often in studies of the Gregorian repertory, but have almost never been the primary subject of a work. This dissertation focuses on the importance of the Pistoia codices themselves.    Examining the political and social environment in which the manuscripts were created, this study places the sources in a specific historical context and advances hypotheses about the creation and dating of the manuscripts. The codices were copied during a period in which the cathedral chapter gained unprecedented wealth, power, and autonomy. Although the most specific dating I have found for the sources places them somewhere in the late eleventh or early twelfth century, several factors support a dating of between 1108 and 1133 with a terminus post quem non as early as 1116.    The repertory preserved in the Pistoia choirbooks is primarily Gregorian; it is generally typical of what had become the standard repertory of north-central Italy by the eleventh or twelfth century. A closer examination, however, reveals regional elements and patterns of transmission that reflect Pistoia's location at the convergence of six ancient and medieval roads. Traces of the repertories of France, Aquitaine, southern Italy and Benevento, England, and German-speaking lands are all present in the Pistoia choirbooks. These non-standard items highlight musico-liturgical and socio-political influences on medieval Pistoia.    The choirbooks produced at Pistoia in the early twelfth century are exemplars of the Gregorian repertory, central Italian notation of the period, and caroline miniscule script. The Pistoia codices offer valuable information about a unique period in medieval Italy, the ecclesiastical administration of a specific diocese, and the transmission of western plainchant throughout Europe.",0
Seeing imagism: A poetics of literary visualization,"This dissertation investigates the ways in which poetry encourages visual images in the reader. This investigation breaks new ground, for in the wake of behaviorist psychology and the linguistic turn in literary theory, literary critics have ignored and often spurned the visual imagination. The project uses Imagist poetry as a case study, for several reasons: the movement valorized the ""image,"" a vague but provocative entity; Imagist doctrine is full of strong appeals to vision and the reader's eye; and the movement inaugurated modern (20th century) poetry in English, and is thus historically crucial. This dissertation argues that Imagist poetry sustains its visual claims through several textual features that promote mental imagery for readers. Significantly, diction is only one influence on image formation; grammar, metaphor, and meter are also key. This project examines five textual features - concreteness, parataxis, image metaphor, prompting, and free verse - and analyzes each feature's appeal to imagery through the latest insights of cognitive psychology. Concrete diction is primary: research reveals that concrete words produce more vivid images than abstract words, and in a shorter time. That Imagism's embrace of the concrete yields clear cognitive effects is perhaps an unsurprising notion. However, larger poetic structures also influence visualization. Research on sentences indicates that paratactic structures encourage more imagery than hypotactic structures, so the leaps and disjunctures common to Imagist poetry are likely to spur visualization. Further, many Imagist poems contain what cognitive scientists call ""image metaphors,"" which imply a visual resemblance between two terms and thus encourage the reader to form an image. In addition, Imagist poems often thematize the act of seeing and thus implicitly ""prompt"" the reader to visualize, to see what the speaker sees. Finally, and most speculatively, research on music and cognition suggests that free verse may promote imagery more than metrical verse - a serendipitous outcome of metrical loosening. In broadest terms, this mode of analysis - a poetics of visualization - helps restore critical attention to the interaction of texts and the visual imagination.",0
The Blues: An interdisciplinary curricular design,"Statement of the problem. The purpose of this study was to facilitate high school teachers' development of interdisciplinary units of study, with a musical genre as the organizing center of the curriculum. Along with maintaining the integrity of the high school music program's scope and sequence, this project provided an opportunity for faculty, students, and staff to experience the Blues in an educational setting.   Procedure. The decision to select the Blues as the organizing center for this curricular project was motivated by the notion that participating faculty and their students may have had some exposure to Blues music. Several contemporary musical genres (i.e., Hip Hop, Rock and Roll, Rap), to which many high school students listen, are influenced by or have musical roots in the Blues. In addition, to recruit teachers to participate in this project, selecting a musical genre that appealed to the faculty and could be seamlessly integrated into the required curriculum was important to gaining administrative and faculty support for this project.   This study examined interdisciplinary instructional models that would promote and assist: (1) Faculty in understanding how employing information from more than one subject area, i.e., music, English language arts, social studies, communications/technology, mathematics, and health education, may inform students' knowledge as they explore connections across disciplines of knowledge to study a musical genre. (2) Teachers in designing lessons that impart knowledge about why the Blues emerged as a musical genre. (3) Participants in developing units of study with instructional activities embedded in their design to create an opportunity for the practical application of academic skills as students further their knowledge of the Blues.   Results. As a result of this interdisciplinary design, the participating music teachers were able to devote their instructional time to the teaching of musical skills and knowledge. All related subject matter, i.e., contextual information, was taught by a content area specialist.   Conclusions. This project offered teachers an opportunity to design interdisciplinary curricula to implement in the classroom along with delivering instruction through discrete subject areas.",0
Peer assisted learning in the acquisition of musical composition skills,"The purpose of the study was to discover the effects of using peer assisted learning in acquiring skills in music composition. The ten criteria used for assessing the effects of peer assisted learning comprised six concerning social qualities and four relating to cognitive aspects of what might be learned from working and learning together. The research used both qualitative and quantitative methods, encompassing interviews with the teacher, questionnaires for the students and observation. The latter included a quantitative element. The research took place in the natural settings of timetabled music lessons in Year Seven at an English comprehensive secondary school. This peer assisted learning research is believed to be the only such project conducted entirely in the unadulterated classroom settings. The lessons followed the teacher’s choice of lesson material and the length of time normally allowed for lessons in that school. No changes in classroom organisation, timing, or for any other reason were requested by, or made for, the researcher. Each class was divided into groups whose size, ability and gender were determined by the teacher. From these groups, the teacher selected the three which were the focus of this research. All three of the sample groups showed some evidence of the beneficial effects of peer assisted learning socially and cognitively although this varied according to the children’s different ability levels. Peer assisted learning was found to be most successful where children were able to work together cohesively and communicate well, either verbally or musically. Most children either acquired new musical skills or enhanced those they already possessed through the use of peer assisted learning.",0
Philosophical implications on trombone performance and pedagogy in Andre Lafosse's curriculum at the Paris Conservatory,"During his tenure as the professor of trombone at the Paris Conservatory, Andre Lafosse wrote the Traite de Pedagogy du Trombone a Coulisse  addressing trombone pedagogy that was to be studied in conjunction with his method and etude books, Methode Complete de Trombone and Vade Mecum du Tromboniste. The pedagogic philosophy reflects Lafosse's own experiences as an orchestral musician in France in the early 20th-century. Lafosse designed and used his treatise to prepare students to be effective teachers after their graduation from the Conservatory. The scope of preparation for Lafosse's trombone class, however, was limited. He did not attempt to provide a text or tutor that would prepare trombonists for any career in music: Lafosse was primarily concerned with orchestral trombone playing, as reflected in musical exercises, instrument designation, and repertoire references. Solo performance skills are also explained at length in his treatise, and Lafosse includes his own solo transcriptions in the curriculum. This emphasis placed on performing as a soloist appears to oppose Lafosse's implied preference for orchestral performance.    Throughout his career as a trombone professor Andre Lafosse compiled and wrote music that emphasized elements of trombone technique based on the French solo and orchestral repertoire. His primary concern as a teacher was developing the skills for an orchestral career in France, but his method was to use exercises that focused on certain technical aspects of trombone performance. The exercises and etudes chosen were all influenced by French music regarding the skills deemed important by Lafosse (i.e. those required by the French orchestral and solo repertoire) and the acoustic design of the trombone in France in the early 20th century. Considering the holistic context of Lafosse's role at the Paris Conservatory, Lafosse's curriculum and methodology should be deemed appropriately designed for the best interest of the students.    In the following pages the implications of Lafosse's philosophy will be explored in order to understand the basis for his ideas, and his pedagogic approach will be evaluated in the context of the mid 20th century. The purpose of these endeavors is to discover Lafosse's reasoning and its appropriateness within a synchronic context.",0
The idea of <i>Kunstreligion</i> in German musical aesthetics of the early nineteenth century,"In the simplest formulation, musical Kunstreligion—“art religion”—is the belief that music is divine. This aesthetic idea emerged in German-speaking lands around 1800. In music, it manifested itself as a matrix of convictions about listening, the concert, the composer, and musical works. While twentieth-century writers have cited Kunstreligion  in relation to instrumental music, early nineteenth-century formulations of the concept concerned a wider range of musical experiences. A more balanced approach to the elements of music and spirituality in Kunstreligion  will lead to a fuller understanding of the concept and its significance in musical aesthetics.    After discussing the nature of early nineteenth-century Kunstreligion  as an aesthetic idea, I outline developments in philosophy and theology out of which Kunstreligion emerged (“Toward a Definition of Kunstreligion” and “Concepts in Context”). Contemporary writers thought of the relationship between music and spirituality in three primary ways: music as giving voice to spiritual ideas; musical experience and spiritual experience as similar; and music as perceived as its own particular type of spirituality. Each of the three perspectives exists independently and in combination with the others, and the most compelling examples of  Kunstreligion fall in areas where all three spheres intersect.    Chapters two through six consider implications of Kunstreligion  for musical aesthetics of the early nineteenth century. Chapter two (“The Rise of Contemplative Listening”) shows how spiritual ideas of contemplation shaped accounts of musical listening. Chapter three (“Sacred Time and Sacred Space: The Concert as Gottesdienst ”) follows early nineteenth-century discussions of the  Gottesdienst and their influence on contemporary descriptions of concert life. Chapter four (“The Composer as Prophet, Priest, and Transfigured Deity”) places early nineteenth-century depictions of composers as exercising divine capabilites in a wider historical context. Chapter five (“Transforming Church Music: Kunstreligion and the ‘New Religious Music’”) traces ways in which Kunstreligion  shaped and was shaped by the reception of church music such as Mozart's  Requiem. The final chapter (“Kunstreligion in the Reception of Beethoven's Works”) argues that Kunstreligion  was reflected in an emphasis on the union of the sacralized composer and the sacralized work in Beethoven reception of the 1810s and 1820s.",0
Usage and development of piano method books in Taiwan: Interviews and observations with piano teachers,"The purposes of this research are: (a) to evaluate the use of elementary-age piano methods in Taiwan and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different methods from an experienced Taiwanese piano teacher's point of view, especially relating to Taiwan's cultural background and structure of society, and (b) to provide a basis for developing future methods suitable for Taiwanese culture. Four categories of research questions were addressed. (1) What do experienced Taiwanese piano teachers think of the methods from different countries? (2) How do they use these methods? (3) Are there any problems for Taiwanese piano teachers in using the foreign methods? and (4) Is it important to develop Taiwanese methods?    This study employed a qualitative methodological approach. Individual, in-depth interviews with ten expert Taiwanese piano teachers and observations of each expert's teaching of two elementary-age students were conducted to collect data. The non-probability, snowball sampling technique was used to select ten participants. After the interviews were transcribed, copies of the transcripts were sent to the participants to assure them of the study's trustworthiness. Afterwards, the researcher searched for patterns and common themes among participant's responses. After coding the data, the researcher discussed and resolved disagreements with the independent reviewer before addressing the findings.    The findings indicate that Taiwanese teachers believe that European methods are technique-oriented and efficient while American methods, in contrast, are more motivational, interesting, and are thoroughly concerned with the development of musical concepts. Therefore, Taiwanese teachers have a strong tendency towards combining the European method Beyer with American methods, along with Japanese anthologies. However, teachers indicate several problems with using foreign methods, including the English alphabet problem, language translation problems, physical problems, and repertoire selection problems. Teachers in this study had a strong tendency towards thinking that the development of Taiwanese methods is not necessary. However, they offered several suggestions for developing future Taiwanese methods, including adding music appreciation materials, Chinese literature and Chinese musical concepts within the mainstream, and western-based classical music content.    Several results imply that Taiwan's piano education circle has gradually changed from pianistic technique-based lessons to emphasizing the integrity of music learning. Teachers' strong tendency of combining different methods and materials implies that Taiwanese piano teachers feel hesitant and insecure to use either American methods or European methods exclusively. Also, Taiwanese piano teachers are not enthusiastic about developing methods because of the existing abundant materials in Taiwan's small market. This result may imply that expert teachers are more independent regarding the use and selection of methods. It may also imply the common attitude of Taiwan's ignorance of innovation. For future development of methods, Taiwan may need to expand its market to other Chinese speaking countries in order to make the development of those methods more price-worthy.",0
"Teacher preparation, methods and materials for music education in rural and one -room schools in selected areas of the Midwest (1890–1950)","This dissertation explores the status and growth of music education in rural and one-room schools from 1890–1950, limited to English-speaking public schools in selected areas of the Midwest especially Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Chapters on teacher preparation, teaching methods and materials follow an overview of rural education.    This study utilized historical methods including archival and oral history analysis. Eight one-room school students and teachers from Winnebago County, Iowa were interviewed in addition to Eunice Boardman, Judith Svengalis and Stanley Schleuter, who earned music education doctorates and attended rural or one-room schools. Photographs, ephemera, teaching licenses, exams, course notes, scrapbooks, letters, manuscripts, unpublished reports and dissertations of the time were also examined.    Music was occasionally included in preparing rural teachers at county institutes, extension and correspondence courses, normal schools and colleges. Music was sometimes included on eighth grade, county and state teacher's examinations for initial certification or continuing education.    Teaching methods besides the recitation were utilized in one-room schools. During the Progressive Education movement, music programs, pageants and projects were common teaching methods. In Iowa, the Choir and Phonograph Plans of Charles Fullerton were designed for rural teachers. Edgar B. Gordon pioneered vocal music radio broadcasts for Wisconsin school children. Both Fullerton and Gordon instituted rural choir festivals.    Teaching materials were varied, but scarce. The Victrola, pump organ, piano and rhythm or homemade instruments were available. Innovative Victrola recordings corresponded with Fullerton's textbook. Grade books, daily schedules, standardized school regulations, written curriculum, teacher magazines and journals guided rural teachers. Early textbooks were typically glee club songbooks or graded series books, designed for trained musicians. A content analysis of eleven rural music books is included in this study.    Rural school innovations such as recordings and textbooks designed for nonmusic specialists, distance education and improvements in teacher licensure continue today. Further research in rural music education should include other geographical areas and diversity in religion, language and race.",0
Zhenwu: The cult of a Chinese warrior deity from the Song to the Ming dynasties (960–1644),"This study explores the interaction between Daoism and popular religion in China by focusing on the development and evolution of a cult that centered on a deity called the Perfected Warrior (Zhenwu). His cult has flourished across China since the eleventh century and is still alive in mainland China, Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities. To explore the diversity and complexity of this cult I employ a wide range of primary sources in my study including religious scriptures, stone inscriptions, official documents, private anecdotes, local gazetteers, and vernacular literature; many of them have never been introduced to the English-speaking world. In this study, I argue that the popularity of the Zhenwu cult is a result of a combined process of canonization and localization that transformed a deity of warrior origin into a multi-faceted and multi-functional god.    This thesis is divided into two parts. Part I gives a general framework of the Zhenwu cult from ancient to late imperial times. In Chapter One, I trace the Zhenwu cult to his predecessor, Xuanwu (section 1), and outline the development of the Zhenwu cult among the people (section 2) as well as the imperial patronage bestowed on the deity from the Song to Ming dynasties (section 3). Chapter Two portrays Daoist images of Zhenwu presented in liturgical instruction manuals for Offering rituals (jiao), exorcism, inner alchemy, and military rituals. The chief mountain of the Zhenwu cult, Wudang shan, is discussed in section 2.    Part II contains textual studies and case studies. In Chapter Three, I closely examine two “precious volumes” or baojuan (section 1) and one hagiographic fictional account of Zhenwu from the late sixteenth century, the Journey to the North (section 2). Chapter Four presents three case studies: the Zhenwu cult in Fujian, Foshan (in Guangdong), and Taiwan. These three case studies will demonstrate that the popularity of Zhenwu was not simply a result of a wide geographic spread of the cult but, more importantly of an enduring existence that resulted from successful localization.",0
"Music, mind, and the total education of the developing child","Music Education in schools is a fundamental part of receiving a liberal education. Though music is mandated across the United States, it is still found to be substandard or non-existent in many districts. The defense supports music as a vital part of childhood development and its equality in merit and rigor with the core subjects: Math, Science, English, and Social Studies. This interdisciplinary study discusses neurological and biological analysis, cerebral dominance, developmental psychology, education philosophy, vocal pedagogy, affective growth, music's effect on an individual's health and future success, and political agendas. It also describes the reciprocal, communicative and communal environment of the music classroom. The position will establish that music programs are indispensable to the cultivation of critical inquiry skills, cognitive, social, and aesthetic development and they are the foundation of a child's cultural and communal identity. Its absence or compromise will inhibit the total, liberal education of America's youth.",0
Roger McGough:  the poetics of accessibility. (BL: DXN068308),"Since the publication of The Mersey Sound in 1967, the poetry of Roger McGough has remained popular and influential.  This anthology of poetry has been the most successful in the history of Penguin Books, having sold over 750,000 copies.  McGough's work has been part of the A Level examination curriculum for over thirty years and is to remain so till 2007.  Penguin published the 418 page Collected Poems of McGough in November 2003 and the poet received the Doctorate of Literature from Hull University in January 2004.       The purpose of this thesis is to examine and evaluate the accessibility of McGough's message to a wide, general readership, as well as appraising it by the most rigorous literary standards, and will challenge and answer the notion that his popularity and commercial success indicate lack of intellectual integrity.  Rather than addressing his association with musical groups, or his appearances on stage, or television and radio performances, attention will be focused on publication and readings of his serious poetry, even in some of the children's collections, but primarily in the more penetrating social satires such as Summer with Monika, Holiday on Death Row and more recently in Blazing Fruit, The Way Things Are and Everyday Eclipses.       As this thesis will become a form of critical biography, McGough's accessibility will be considered in terms of his early education in Liverpool, and the influence of his socio-economic inheritance in the working class environment, his study in a first rate grammar school and then at a university.  McGough learned to make himself heard and understood by all his English-speaking audiences, but he never lost the particular demotic flavour of the Liverpool manner and wit.  His special talent has been an original use of poetic language, the inverted cliché, the ironic metaphoric trope and neologistic devices.",0
"Consuming identities: Consumption, gender and ethnicity among West Indian adolescents in Brooklyn","Brooklyn's first- and second-generation black immigrants from the English-speaking Caribbean negotiate between West Indian and American definitions of race, ethnicity and gender. This dissertation explores how West Indian adolescent girls, in particular, use cultural products such as music, fashion, television and food in forming their gender and ethnic identities.    Tenuously positioned between the stages of childhood and adulthood, and between West Indian and American ideologies of identity, my informants utilized Caribbean cultural products to assert West Indian identities. Yet, they simultaneously made use of American images and commodities to ally themselves with their African American peers. By illustrating the hybridity of cultural products in Flatbush I argue that we are mistaken to think of the identities of members of the African diaspora as entirely similar or dissimilar.   The ethnographic research was conducted from 1997 to 1999 in the Crown Heights and Flatbush sections of Brooklyn. Utilizing data obtained from participant observation and interviews with thirty-nine adolescent girls and four mothers who frequented after-school programs hosted by two leisure institutions, I present youths' interpretations of the cultural products they consumed. I argue that my adolescent informants demonstrated consumer agency and engaged themselves with larger discourses regarding the effects of mass culture on youth by framing their consumption habits in notions of “positive” versus “negative” consumption.   Understanding that black youth who emulate “whiteness” are perceived as having low self-esteems, my informants interpreted mass cultural products produced by and for blacks as “positive.” Conversely, however, they also chose to identify with the “negative” personae of sexually provocative black female rappers, and with mainstream white television actresses. The “positive/negative” framework of consumption was also utilized by adults at the fieldsites who sought to shield the girls from explicit sexuality presented in hip hop music and on television. I problematize my informants' notions of “positive/negative” consumption in order to shed light on how race, ethnicity and gender are constructed. My work represents an intervention in a popular and academic discourse of consumption that tends to present adolescents in general as devoid of agency, and black female adolescents, in particular, as invisible.",0
Speaking our peace: Communicating partnership in deed and word. A curriculum for teacher education,"Two alternatives exist for human social organization: gylany (partnership) or androcracy (domination); all relationships fall on a continuum between them. Historically, partnership more effectively promotes peaceful, sustainable societies. How people communicate—verbally and otherwise—greatly influences which worldview structures their cultures and relationships.    “Gylany” describes relationships based on equality, interconnectedness, and mutual empowerment, first between the female and male halves of humanity, and in all relationships. Conversely, “androcracy,” or rule by men, is the model for hierarchical relationships where differences result in domination by some individuals or groups over others. Sexism, racism, homophobia, ageism, religious intolerance, etc. are interlocking systems of domination based on judgment, ranking, force and fear. They are reinforced by English structure, vocabulary, and usage, along with other forms of communication, in mass media and among individuals.    This curriculum is a semester-length (fifteen week) graduate course to be taught to teachers at all levels, preschool through university. Its focus is gylanic (partnership) communication: what it is (and isn't), why it's important, how to create and use it, and how to teach it. Its main tools of analysis are the “partnership and dominator lenses” which reveal elements of linking or ranking in all forms of communication, policy, and action. The course uses original stories, music, ritual, and interactive, experiential pedagogy to model collaborative structure and process. All lessons utilize multiple intelligences and diverse learning styles. Learners are encouraged to integrate course content and processes into their personal and professional lives.    An introductory essay provides the scholarly context for all curriculum design choices: structure, content and pedagogy. It first describes the emerging field of gylanic studies, exploring the values and educational practices of a partnership paradigm. It then theorizes the major elements of partnership-oriented pedagogy and communication, both verbal and non-verbal.    Both curriculum and contextual essay offer practical tools for deconstructing domination-oriented discourse and cocreating partnership-oriented communication. Both provide extensive resources on partnership-oriented education and communication. Both suggest specific language and strategies for moving toward partnership in all relationships among individuals, groups, and humanity and the rest of Nature.",0
A testament to tenacity: Cultural persistence in the letters and speeches of Eastern Band Cherokee women,"As the life-givers of their nation, Cherokee women have traditionally had an important voice in the socio-political affairs of their people. Beginning in the late eighteenth century, however, Euro-American political leaders sought to replace the “petticoat government” of the Cherokees with their own form of patriarchal leadership. Increasingly alarmed over the encroachment of white settlers and the threat to their lives and culture, Beloved Women  Nanye'hi and Kitteuha continued to speak publicly and to write letters of protest as long as they lived.    After the Revolutionary War, Christian missionaries moved into Cherokee territory, beginning an era of enforced assimilation and concerted attempts to “civilize” the Indians living there. Mission schools were established, and Cherokee children were taught to repudiate the ancient teachings of their people. Forbidden to speak in their own language, Cherokee schoolgirls wrote letters in English to convince white benefactors of the positive qualities of their people, and to protest the government's proposal to remove them to the West. By the late 1800s, government officials and religious leaders had accelerated their efforts to bring Indian women into the “cult of true womanhood.” Boarding schools, like Hampton Institute in Virginia, recruited Eastern Band Cherokee girls, then trained them for subservient roles as wives and/or domestics. Although they adopted some elements of white culture, most of these girls never forgot that they were Indian, and they used their oratory and literary skills to promote the culture of their own people.    Eastern Cherokee women of today are as determined as were their foremothers to preserve their Indian culture. By means of letters and public speeches, they are actively protesting racism and exploitation, as well as garnering support for the revitalization of the Cherokee language, traditional dances/songs, and indigenous methods of healing.    “A Testament to Tenacity” documents letters and speeches recovered from government records, student files, missionary diaries, newspapers, and religious periodicals, and gives voice to Cherokee women whose words have been silenced for much too long.",0
The role of connection to the native culture in intercultural marriages: Perceptions of Puerto Rican women,"This dissertation investigates the migration experience of Puerto Rican women, their connection to the native culture and their perceptions of the role of this connection in their intercultural marriages. Critical issues such as; the degree and quality of involvement that is maintained with one's culture and heritage, and the ways of responding to, and dealing with, a second culture emerge upon migration. Intercultural marriage (Rohrlich, 1988), the marriage where partners are of differing ethnic origins, has been associated with the process of second culture acquisition. It has been visualized as an indicator of minority assimilation and weakening of the cohesion of an ethnic group (Murguia, 1982). Marrying outside one's ethnic group could imply a loss of connection to the native culture, which encourages the person to move more rapidly toward the majority culture. Using a qualitative-descriptive design, data was gathered through in-depth interviews with five interculturally married migrant Puerto Rican women.    Data from this study revealed that these women see themselves as competent, assertive, mature, and strong women who are culturally different from their North American counterparts. The women indicated that they constantly draw coping strategies and behaviors from two different cultural contexts (Puerto Rican/North American) and that they feel effective and competent within the majority culture because they have achieved a sense of internal balance where decision making and survival strategies are bicultural. Nevertheless, they feel restrained when they express some feelings and ideas in the presence of North Americans. They also sustain a sense of not belonging in the American culture. Women indicated that they need to feel connected in one way or another to their primary culture. Besides other aspects of connection to the Puerto Rican culture; e.g. the use of Spanish, perpetuation of familism, maintenance of friendships with compatriots, listening and dancing to Hispanic music, and cooking Puerto Rican food, some women reported a metaphysical dimension of connection. Suggested areas of disconnection from the primary culture were related to rebellion towards values that perpetuate parental and male preponderance. Findings indicated that women validate their opposition to these values (disconnection) within the context of their intercultural marriages. The use of some nonverbal behaviors, the relationship with the in-laws, different views in parenting, time and financial planning emerged as areas of marital conflict. Implications for research and practice were discussed.",0
Hexachordal theory in the late thirteenth century,"In the second half of the thirteenth century, the sight-singing practice based on a six-note unit, later known as hexachord, received a theoretical systematization in several music treatises. These treatises not only described the technical elements of solmization (gamut, hand, property, and mutation), but also developed a theoretical system in which the hexachord was regarded as a structural unit capable of interacting with other fundamental aspects of medieval music theory, such as modality, interval measurements, and musica falsa.    The primary focus of the present work is to provide a detailed analysis of the hexachordal theory as it appears in the treatises of the following theorists: Lambertus, Amerus, Helias Salomon, Jerome de Moravia, Johannes de Garlandia, the anonymous author of Summa musice, Walter Odington, Aegidius of Zamora, Johannes de Grocheio, and several anonymi from the same era. The study also includes the two fourteenth-century theorists Engelbert of Admont and Jacques de Liege, as they closely relate to the thirteenth-century stage of the hexachordal theory.    The comparative study of all these treatises reveals a multiform picture, more diversified than heretofore recognized, both in terms of solmization practice and of theoretical speculation. As regards the former, the study proves the existence of different systems of mutation, different applications of the so-called Guidonian hand, and even alternative practices of solmization, such as the one suggested by Helias Salomon, based on five syllables rather than six. The study also gives evidence of a dispute, among thirteenth-century musicians, concerning the number of properties in solmization.    In dealing with the more speculative side of the hexachordal theory, the most interesting findings regard the relationship between hexachord and modes, especially evident in the works of Salomon and Jerome, and the relationship between hexachord and musica falsa. The latter receives very different treatments, as some theorists strive against the introduction of notes outside the gamut, while others try to justify such notes in terms of the hexachordal system, although starting from different premises and producing different outcomes (falsa mutatio, synemmena). Furthermore, the analysis of the definitions for the major hexachordal concepts shows the influence of Latin grammar and especially of Aristotelian philosophy. In particular, the application of the Aristotelian concept of ""principle"" to the hexachord seems to have been the focus of another debate among theorists.    The study also provides a careful examination of the terminology used by each theorist for the major concepts of the hexachordal theory. On the basis of such an examination, it seems appropriate to assume the existence, alongside the continental tradition, of a separate English tradition of hexachordal theory.",0
Miyagi Michio and his works for koto and shakuhachi,"Miyagi Michio (1894-1956) is one of the most well-known Japanese composers and koto players. Blind by age seven, he received a certificate for the highest proficiency in koto playing when he was just eleven years old. Upon the opening of Japan to the West during the Meiji period (1867-1912), Western music was introduced to the country. When Japanese musicians heard Western music, they endeavered in some way to fuse these new scales and examples of polyphony with traditional Japanese instruments and techniques. The music of Miyagi represents one of the first successful meldings of Western and Japanese art.    The primary purpose of the study is to help make Japanese music known to Western musicians by a study of Miyagi's music, specifically his works for koto and shakuhachi. Very little is known about Japanese music in the West; however, the opposite is not true in Japan. Today Japan simultaneously supports two cultures of art music. It is just as possible and convenient to attend a concert of Western music consisting of symphonies, Lieder, and piano sonatas as it is to attend a hogaku (Japanese ""traditional music"") concert. It is hoped that by this study of Miyagi's music and the arrangements of three works written for koto and shakuhachi for clarinet and piano (Izumi, Uguisu, and Haru no Umi), one possible avenue will be provided for Western musicians seeking knowledge of Japanese music to become acquainted with it. Interviews with Japanese musicians and artists augment the traditional sources consulted.    Miyagi's music seems to have had a universal appeal in his own lifetime. French violinist Renee Chemet toured Japan and heard Haru no Umi in 1932. She was immediately inspired to arrange the shakuhachi part for violin and performed and recorded it with Miyagi. In 1929 Miyagi gave a recital using a special eighty-string koto which he had invented. He performed his own works on this instrument as well as preludes by J. S. Bach. It is hoped that this paper and the arrangements in Appendix Two are rendered in the same spirit of musical cultural exchange.",0
The criterion-related validity of a test of implicit phonological awareness,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine the criterion-related validity of the Test of Implicit Phonology (a modification of Lance, 1994) with valid measures of phonological awareness and reading ability. This test used a forced choice paradigm employing nonsense word pairs (e.g., /$\int$kib/--/$\int$rib/) of which one member violated the rules of phoneme combination in English and the other was permissible for phoneme combination in English.    Subjects selected for this study were 81 normally developing first-graders and second-graders who were tested using six different experimental measures and the Test of Implicit Phonology (TIP). The six tasks chosen to assess the criterion-related validity included: the Yopp-Singer phoneme segmentation task (Yopp, 1988); a phoneme deletion task (Bruce, 1964); a phoneme blending task (Catts, 1993); the word identification subtest and word attack subtest of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised (Woodcock, 1987); and the Phonological Screening-Multisyllabic subtest of the Assessment of Phonological Processes-Revised (Hodson, 1986).    The results indicated that there was a positive significant correlation between the TIP and two of the phonological awareness tasks, both tasks of decoding and the multisyllabic word production task. Additionally, the first-grade children performed significantly lower than the second-grade children on the TIP, thus indicating that the TIP was also sensitive to developmental phonological awareness differences between the first- and second-grade children. It was concluded that the TIP has criterion-related validity as a phonological awareness assessment tool. With further inquiry this paradigm could prove to be a method of appraisal that is not confounded by reading and spelling instruction thus resulting in a more accurate assessment of implicit phonological awareness.",0
Keyboard arrangements of lully's music and their significance for french harpsichord music,"This thesis aims to establish the place of keyboard arrangements from Lully within the French harpsichord repertoire in matters relating to style, detail of techniques, and performance practice.  Chapter One provides the background for the practice of making arrangements by reviewing contemporary and secondary documents.  I underline the fact that the making of arrangements (since Attaingnant 1531) contributed to an enlargement of the keyboard repertoire, and that the concurrent rise of Lully and the harpsichord, both associated with the aristocratic world, inevitably led to the practice of making arrangements from Lully.Chapter Two examines the keyboard sources in detail in order to determine the relationship of Lully arrangements to the original harpsichord repertoire.  Gustafson's catalogue provides most of the sources relevant to this study.  My contribution involves the study of performance media, scribal habits, notation, and all matters which shed light on the background of these sources.  As a rule, arrangements may appear in sources in one of the three main contexts, indicating their use:  (1) in anthologies consisting exclusively of arrangements; (2) in self-contained orchestral-type suites; (3) in composite suites containing works of more than one composer.Chapter Three analyzes the techniques employed by arrangers to solve the problem of representing orchestral textures on the keyboard.  It also aims to establish the status of individual arrangers and to determine how the making of arrangements from orchestral music widens the range of effects available to keyboard players.  Such an analysis shows that, whole some of the techniques obviously belong to part of the common vocabulary of contemporary keyboard language, others appear to have been developed specifically from the practice of making arrangements.",0
Ordinateur et applications creatives en musique: Etude de deux approches basees sur le logiciel Tuneblocks,"The purpose of this study was to explore the compositional processes of nine-year-old children using a microprocessor computer. Ten children were divided in two groups and were asked to compose a melody by arranging musical blocks. Children in the first group were given pre-composed blocks of Mozart's piano sonatas. Children in the second group were asked to compose their own blocks. Bamberger's computer program, Tuneblocks, was adapted for a use on a Macintosh microcomputer with French-speaking children.    Results revealed that type of task does not affect the process-product orientation adopted by children. Pedagogical implications explore the findings in terms of practical applications of both approaches.",0
The development of discourse competence in Finnish children: The expression of definiteness,"The developing discourse competence of children acquiring Finnish as their native language was investigated in the domain of definiteness, a discourse-pragmatic category whose essential feature is the marking of referent identifiability. The expression of definiteness in Finnish, a non-article-bearing language, if it is marked at all, is achieved through a diffuse array of devices, including word order, case variation, and optional article-like elements and other lexical items, all of which may act singly or in combination with each other. The guiding motivation of the study was the extent and manner to which a language which encodes referent identifiability through a variety of means affects the course of development of this essential discourse-pragmatic function.    Finnish children aged 3 to 9 years participated in two kinds of production tasks, the data from which served as the basis for making crosslinguistic comparisons: (1) a referent disambiguation task, in which the child described two successive actions which varied the coreferential relationship (present or absent) and relational features (uniqueness, similarity, or identicality) of the objects acted upon, and (2) a narrative task, which also included adult subjects, in which short samples of connected discourse were elicited using a picture story. Finnish children, like child speakers of other languages, were found to exhibit a long course of development in the encoding of definiteness, characterized by qualitatively different ""stages"" and its late marking by purely intralinguistic means, starting around 6 years of age. Before this age, children used forms primarily in their deictic function. However, Finnish children, like Chinese children, showed a preference for scNP-level over clause-level devices, despite the reverse tendency in the adult model. A predisposition toward local cues over word order variation was hypothesized as the basis for this observed preference. The language was also seen to exert an influence on the age at which the Finnish child encodes definiteness in situations requiring explicit marking. The lack of the obligatory encoding of definite and indefinite reference in Finnish, in contrast to languages with a formal article system, e.g., French, was explored as a likely explanatory factor for this perceived crosslinguistic difference.",0
Gaining access to the inner mechanisms of jazz improvisation,"The thesis aims to assemble a new and more relevant approach to learning the art and craft of jazz improvisation. The primary need for a new learning strategy is the apparent absence of a systematic learning programme embracing the inner mechanisms which generate the highly personal, highly interactive language of jazz. The nature of the language of jazz is therefore considered in detail, its processes, products and core materials being systematically presented as an holistic analysis system which identifies the hierarchy of articulation materials and structural forces of jazz improvisation. The analysis system is called 'Practical Analysis Technique', and it is applied to transcriptions of solos from six recordings made during the 1940s and 50s which are representative of the approaches taken to tonal improvisation during this period. These solos are used as models for identifying and extrapolating the significant inner mechanisms which generate their surface structure. Observations relating to the inner mechanisms of jazz improvisation are then collated and used as the basis for the design and testing of effective learning materials and strategies in an 'Experimental Learning Programme'.    Practical Analysis Technique reveals that the art of improvisation is based upon many skills and aptitudes which have hitherto been overlooked, or underestimated, and that their identification provides a comprehensive basis upon which to begin the formulation of more carefully considered learning objectives. In particular it becomes apparent that the generating forces of tonal harmony are at the heart of the inner mechanisms of jazz, demonstrating that the ubiquitous 'chord scale syllabus' approach to improvisation is largely inappropriate. The Experimental Learning Programme reveals that the combination of aspects of linguistic structure and appropriate practical environments for learning a 'second language' present the possibility of exciting new, and more relevant approaches to the design of learning systems, in which the student is encouraged from the outset to engage in interactive musical 'conversation'.",0
The development of an organizational model for congregational growth and social mission inspired by ecclesial base communities in Central America,"A model for congregational development is described in detail which is based on small groups, organized through natural affinity, which practice spiritual reflection and lay ministry. The author adapted the paradigm of base Christian communities in Central America for a Unitarian Universalist church in Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. She drew on experience with peace affinity groups as well as megachurch organizing techniques.    The project discovers, through experiments with ministry reflection groups of eight to twelve participants, the difficulty in achieving a spiritual focus and an identity grounded in work for social justice in a church whose members enjoy exploring many faith traditions and come to church primarily to seek support and direction in raising a family and handling the stresses of affluent, suburban life.    Other groups organize spontaneously with natural affinities, like those for elders, women, writers and folk musicians, and enjoy varying life spans. Their ministry is primarily mutual support. Some committees, whose work may be seen as ministry, adopt portions of the model for their meetings. ""Good Neighbors"" Circles, deliberately organized by zip code, give every church member and visitor a small social group to which they automatically are welcome if they so choose. While they may not choose a spiritual practice, most have undertaken a community-building fund-raiser as their ministry.    Social justice ministries, during this ministry project, included English as a Second Language, a community garden with Hispanic and Anglo participants, a ""No on Nine"" campaign to promote gay and lesbian rights and a Parenting Skills Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse. Most of these were conducted by short-term task forces with specific, attainable goals.    The project's conclusion is that the struggle for meaning and hope is the middle class's counterpart to the struggle for justice and hope waged by the poor. Consistent ministerial leadership, centered in a chosen spiritual discipline of Buddhist meditation, has gradually drawn one reflection group into committed weekly practice and mutual support. This group, which clearly provides meaning for its members, is growing steadily as less focused reflection groups did not.    The dissertation also traces this minister's struggle with her commitment to economic justice in an affluent church in a suburban context.",0
"From ""English vein"" to ""Italian notes"": The stylistic evolution of Purcell's chamber music for strings","Previous studies of Henry Purcell's fantasias and In Nomines and his sonatas have either focused on stylistic analysis or explored the antecedents of this repertoire in older and contemporary instrumental chamber music. The present investigation takes a much broader approach.    First, it examines the historical setting, including Purcell's early training and professional activities, the general scene of instrumental chamber music in England, and the theoretical and pedagogical views of the era. Second, it surveys the roots of Purcell's instrumental chamber style, taking into account recent research on the seventeenth-century Italian sonata da chiesa.    Third, the study explores an area that previous research on Purcell's chamber music has left largely overlooked: the scorebooks that the composer compiled between about 1677 and 1683. These manuscripts reveal the strong influence of sacred music on his instrumental chamber music, and trace a course of stylistic development in which the chamber music for strings appears as the culmination.    The fourth aspect of the study is Purcell's ""Art of Descant,"" the counterpoint treatise he contributed to the twelfth edition of John Playford's An Introduction to the Skill of Music (1694). As the only English didactic work of its day to deal substantively with sonata style, it represents a reprise of the principles Purcell had put into practice in his sonatas of 1683.    The final area of investigation is performance practice. Here too the sacred works of the autograph scorebooks figure as a primary element in laying the groundwork for Purcell's approach to keyboard accompaniment, from his choice of instrument to the style of his ""thorough bass."" The matter of ornamentation is considered as well.",0
A study of select concert works for solo alphorn,"As the national folk instrument of Switzerland, the Alphorn has an interesting and varied history. Common to many herding societies, the Alphorn was used to signal the end of day, evening prayers, and danger. Its repertoire, entitled variously Ranz des vaches, Lobetanze, or Kuhreihen (Kuhreigen), is closely related to the Jodel vocal idiom in structure and melodic pattern.    As early as the ninth century there are quotations and imitations of the Alphorn/Jodel idioms in Western art music. Among the composers discussed are Beethoven, Rossini, Brahms, and Mahler.    The primary focus of the study is the Alphorn as a concert solo instrument, its repertoire, its use in a traditional classical context, and the manner in which composers approach writing for a natural instrument. The selected works to be discussed are: Jean Daetwyler's Sonatina for Alphorn and Flute, Sonata fur 2 Alphoner und Orgel, Concerto II fur Alphorn, Flote, Streichorchester und Schlagzeug; Leopold Mozart's Sinfonia pastorelle; Francis Bovard's Danseries pour Cor des Alpes, brass quartet, and conga drum; and Paolo Baratto's Der Hirte und sein Horn for Alphorn and string orchestra.    The results of this examination will show the musical and technical demands made upon the performer of this natural instrument. Harmonic analysis will reveal how the natural instrument is utilized against a variety of timbral backgrounds.    The music created for professional Alphornists results from the skills, techniques, and the common range of the modern French (sic) horn. All of this suggests a repertoire that belongs in the realm of the hornist, and not the other brasses. The works by Baratto, Bovard, and Daetwyler demonstrate the finest in existing concert works for the Alphorn. All are musically and historically interesting and provide worthwhile additions to a unique and expanding life for what once was a simple folk instrument.",0
"The Norwegian short-term parochial school (religionsskole) in North Dakota Lutheran congregations, 1880s-1930s","Within the Norwegian-American community of the United States and North Dakota there is a memory of ""Norwegian Schools"" held mainly in summers. These schools taught the essence of Lutheranism with hymn singing, and Norwegian grammar and literature. These schools seemed pervasive in North Dakota, but there is little material on them. General church histories neglected them; Sunday School seemed dominant. People who had attended or taught the Norwegian Schools in the early twentieth century were becoming fewer. It was appropriate to research the schools before recollection faded and significance waned.    Research began with anniversary pamphlets of Lutheran churches which affirmed that congregations had sponsored the schools before the year 1900 and for a few decades afterwards. Research led to two archives in Minnesota where papers of churchwomen and personal documents attested to the vitality of the schools in the Norwegian Midwest. In North Dakota individuals were interviewed. The greatest effort was reading the microfilmed minutes of congregational meetings of North Dakota in the original Norwegian. Eventually a hundred and seventy-one congregations were examined.    Research concluded that most Norwegian Lutheran congregations sponsored Norwegian Religion Schools to educate their youth in the basics of their faith, to prepare them for confirmation, and to retain a command of the Norwegian language and other old country traditions. With firm discipline paid teachers taught children for usually six weeks. The celebrations at end of school terms were holidays. Most students were happy with the education they received. By the end of the 1930s English prevailed in speech and Sunday School dominated religious education. The old religion schools were reconstructed into Vacation Bible Schools. The legacy of the old schools was a commitment of many North Dakota congregations to further Christian education by other means.",0
"Music teaching in a secondary school: problems of curriculum design, examination and assessment.","My research has taken place over a period of 4-5 years (from October 1986 - February 1991) and therefore comes at a time of extensive change in the education system, with the introduction of the GCSE examinations in 1988, and the phased introduction of the National Curriculum (beginning with the `CORE SUBJECTS':  English, Mathematics, Science and Modern Languages) in September 1989.  In an attempt to design a valuable and workable music curriculum for pupils in The Castle School, Taunton, (aged 11-16), I have looked at the main issues concerning music education, the current developments which are happening in this country and the system of music education which is firmly established in Hungary.  Whilst holding Franklin's (1972) [1] view that    `lq A pupil who has acquired the skills of making music, and likes to make music, will probably have music as a good companion for the rest of his life,I have researched into the work of Paynter, Swanwick, Taylor and others with regard to curriculum design, and Piaget, Sloboda, Tillman and others with regard to child development and the similarities between learning music and learning a language.  Matters of assessment, including detailed investigation into GCSE assessment and its implications for curriculum design for pupils aged 11-14, have been considered as a major part of the thesis.  An empirical study of pupil-response to class music was undertaken at The Castle School, Taunton and results from questionnaires have been looked at for implications in curriculum design.  The study found that there was an imbalance between the sexes.  Girls tended to be more involved with musical activities outside the classroom than boys, and in the class, a higher percentage of girls than boys understood concepts of pitch and rhythm.  The study also showed pupil-response to different types of classroom activities and pupils generally having a keen desire to know their achievements in different skills.  The study also showed pupils' evaluations of music as a subject against other subjects in the curriculum and considerations that were made in choosing which subjects to study for GCSE.  A number of conclusions were realised and several recommendations for music teaching were made including the need to define a `central core' to the curriculum which had clear steps of progression, the need to set appropriate tasks for pupils of all abilities, and the need to be aware that boys might require more attention and encouragement in their lessons than girls.",0
Traditional singing games of elementary school children in Los Angeles,"In the past fifteen years I have collected approximately three hundred examples of singing games played by school-age children in Los Angeles. With this collection I have tried to devise a workable notation system and to do some preliminary analysis. Further, I have gathered published and unpublished materials on the topic of singing games in the British Isles and in other English-speaking parts of the world.    A preliminary analysis of singing games from Los Angeles indicates that this children's repertoire is transmitted and preserved through oral tradition; it is largely unknown to adults and seems not to have been directly influenced by classroom teachers, music educators, or school curriculum. The topic, therefore is well within the realm of folklore and of informal musical education.    To the best of my knowledge, no one has devised a comprehensive system for notating singing games in such a way that would illustrate simultaneously the essential components--the music, text, and movement. It is my purpose to develop a novel yet practical approach to this task.    Regarding the musical aspects, no one yet has studied a sample repertoire in enough detail to determine whether there are favored patterns or characteristics. A review of the literature indicates that, similarly, while many writers have been intrigued by the rhymes of children's singing games, no one has sought to study a given repertoire in depth, tracing the histories and origins, and examining the influences of popular culture.    Further, little has been done to place this kind of children's lore in the larger context of traditional children's music world-wide. It is my intention to compare traits of children's musical games from Los Angeles with those of children in cultures which have been studied by particular ethnomusicologists abroad. The results of the comparison will then be placed in another context, that of the learning and teaching processes practiced in ""mainstream"" American music education.    The final outcome of this proposed study, therefore, is a comprehensive analysis, based upon a selected repertoire of singing games from Los Angeles. Ultimately, the research points to a broader understanding of the nature and significance of singing games via processes of oral transmission and informal musical education.",0
The discipline of drawing for visual literacy,"This study presents a model for visual literacy, namely, the ability to read information that is presented--in visible Form. This model includes five chapters that describe ""drawing"" as the ""visual"" language without which ""spelling"" would not be possible. Each page is illustrated--to share a vision of Form that stands informed by Plato, Leonardo, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Whitehead, Eliot, Piaget, Witkin, Jung, Dewey, Read, Reid, Langer, Kellogg, Kimball, Gardner, Arnheim, et al. Each chapter represents a level.    First, the ""groundwork"" of education consists of elements that were drawn into ""visible"" Forms to represent ""sounds"" of speech. Second, the groundwork is ruled by a literal syntax of grammar in the ""R's"" that stem from the Seven Liberal Arts. Third, the Latin Arts involved a transformation of the Greek Arts that were ruled by a musical sense of grammar in poetic forms of sound and light. Fourth, the visual grammars are related to the musical grammars. There would be no ""literal"" grammars without the music of speech and the visual sense of Form. Fifth, the discipline of ""drawing"" involves four dimensions of Form in related grammars of Language. The First Language depends upon the sense of an essence of Form. The Second Language is governed by the musical grammars of Sound. The Third Language is based upon the visual grammars of Light. The Fourth Language is ruled by the literal grammars of Speech.    Research indicates that children are aware of these dimensions before schooling. Verbal literacy depends upon visual literacy since letters are read by sight. Therefore, drawing is prescribed in many nations where illiteracy is less common than it is in the United States where many stop to draw after they learn to spell. They give up one system for another. In one, things are seen but words are not. In the other, letters are seen but things are not. Some fail to grasp how seen letters can represent unseen sounds. Others come to believe that ""sight"" words are labels for things. Drawing allows us to see the relations between words and things.",0
The life and work of Isidor Philipp,"Isidor Philipp, famed French pianist and pedagogue, studied with George Mathias at the Paris Conservatory, where he won its First Prize in Piano in 1883. He spent several years thereafter concertizing throughout Europe and playing chamber music in Paris with Henri Berthelier and Jules Loeb. Philipp was appointed to the piano faculty of the Paris Conservatory in 1903, later serving as department head and president of the faculty. In 1922, with the assistance of Walter Damrosch, Mrs. Randall McIvor, and Charles-Marie Widor, Philipp established the American School of Music and Arts at Fontainebleau, directing its music department for the next twelve years. In addition to being a pianist and teacher. Phillip was well known for his many volumes of technical exercises dealing with such pianistic difficulties as the independence of fingers, the passing under of the thumb, scales, arpeggios, octaves, double notes, black keys, and trills.    This doctoral thesis deals with four aspects of Isidor Philipp's life and work. Chapter 1 is a biography emphasizing Philipp's friendships with Saint-Saens, Heller, Widor, Godowsky, A. Rubenstein, Busoni, Stravinsky, Alkan, and Debussy. Chapter 2 summarizes Philipp's teaching philosophy, discussing his ideas on practicing technique, working on the etudes of Chopin, the acquiring of a singing tone, good use of the pedal, the teacher's responsibility to the student, memorization, sight reading skills, repertoire, teaching children, and the adult beginner. Chapter 3 presents a portfolio of Philipp's more successful students, including Jef Alpaerts, Henri Bellamann, Monique de la Bruchollerie, Ania Dorfman, Maurice Dumesnil, Jean Francaix, John Kirkpatrick, Nikita Magaloff, Guiomar Novaes, Soulima Stravinsky, Louise Talma, and Alexander Tcherepnin. Chapter 4 is an annotated bibliography of Philipp's original technical works available in the Isidor Philipp Archives at the Dwight Anderson Memorial Library of the University of Louisville.",0
Schools and schooling in County Durham 1400-1640,"In this investigation of Durham County education between the reigns of Henry IV and Charles I, two kinds of learning are identified - that within a formally endowed school, and occasional study within a choir or at the knee of a private master, incumbent, or chantry priest. Chapter one examines the Medieval school. In the light of recent studies which increasingly stress the flexibility of learning in schools it questions modern interpretations of learning therein and suggests such foundations were diverse and reflected local needs. It is also observed that there were other `centres of learning' where children were educated. Schools and `centres of learning' are identified, dated and enumerated in chapters two and three. In particular, periods of growth and recession in school foundations are noted and studies of founders, endowments, masters' stipends and school organisation are offered. The second part of the thesis assesses the influence of reform on Durham schooling. Chapter four studies the impact of the Dissolution which in A.F. Leach's opinion devastated medieval schools. This view is examined in the light of recent works which tend to stress educational continuity between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Chapter five is concerned with the doctrinal changes of the Reformation and their implications for education. In particular, the role of the clergy and laity as benefactors and patrons, and the problem of religious control and conformity of county schoolmasters is examined. The influence of the Renaissance on grammar and music is investigated in chapters six and seven - particularly the impact of the `New Learning' on the grammar curriculum and the changes in music study occasioned by the liturgical reforms of the late Middle Ages. Finally, in chapter eight, Durham is placed in a broader, national context. Conclusions of this thesis are compared and contrasted with other studies of education in the English regions - particularly the South-West, Yorkshire, and the South-Midlands.",0
FLOW AND THE PERCEIVED BALANCE BETWEEN CHALLENGES AND SKILLS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND OTHER CLASSES IN A SECONDARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM,"A 21-item response sheet was employed to collect data on the occurrence of flow, as well as the thoughts, actions, and certain feelings of students. Three hundred and ten secondary school students were alerted once in each class on two non-consecutive days. The three class types investigated included physical education, high flow type (art, music, shop, etc.), and low flow type, traditionally academic classes (mathematics, English, science, etc.). Data were collected the week of April 7-11, 1986.    Data were treated descriptively to examine means and standard deviations among three class types on the components and dimensions.    Physical education classes had the highest means on all dimensions except one. Physical education classes had the highest subtotal means on the components cognitive efficiency, motivation, activation and affect.    Students in all three classes tended to be thinking about and doing classwork. To a lesser extent students were thinking about and doing social/personal things.    Data were treated descriptively to examine the occurrence of flow (Challenge = Skills) in the three class types. The incidence of flow was determined by the student response frequency on the dimensions challenge and skill. Physical education classes had the highest percentage (32%) of flow while low flow type classes had the lowest percentage (25%) of flow. The high incidence of no flow in each class may have been influenced by the exacting limitations of the requirements for flow.",0
THE MUSIC CRITICISMS OF PETER CORNELIUS (GERMANY),"Peter Cornelius (1824-1874) was a significant composer and music critic of the mid-19th century, who was respected by Wagner, Liszt, and Berlioz for his literary abilities. This dissertation examines the nature and context of this important literary oeuvre. In doing so, it establishes a new basis for investigating music criticism: the separate yet equal consideration of biography, literary style, and musical aesthetics. Throughout the study, the emphasis is on utilizing all available primary sources from Cornelius and his colleagues, especially the critics in Weimar of the 1850s.    The first part, the ""Literary Biography,"" chronologically examines the various factors at work behind Cornelius' literary activities, which has resulted in several new insights. For example, his contributions of behalf of Liszt and Wagner in such a publication as the Neue Zeitschrift did not necessarily originate out of altruism, as previously maintained: often financial or other concerns motivated him. Also his slow, conscientious writing method, as well as his vacillation between desires for musical and literary production, kept Cornelius from becoming a professional critic.    Part II, the analysis of style in Cornelius' critical works, draws upon literary analysis in investigating form, syntax, and grammar. His finely crafted style reveals above all a penchant for figurative language--along with a reliance upon humor and eschewal of polemics, this links Cornelius' criticisms with the literary style of the Romantics, and especially Jean Paul, rather than with the prevailing ""neo-Rationalistic"" style of music critism of his time.    In the third part, the aesthetic viewpoints of Cornelius' critical writings are analyzed. His attitudes on both contemporary and earlier composers closely paralleled the thought of the ""progressive party."" Central to his criticism was the requirement that music display some expressive intention, although he rejected radical expressivity. Cornelius also insisted on the presence of ""German musical qualities"" (i.e. profundity).    Cornelius was able to maintain a position as an independent critic within the progressive party. His oeuvre stands out not only because of the quality of writing and the soundness of judgments but also because of his integrity to his own beliefs.",0
"SCHOOLING FOR ""GOOD REBELS"": SOCIALIST EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES, 1900-1920 (CURRICULUM, NEW YORK CITY, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN)","Barely mentioned in our historical and educational literature are the Socialist weekend schools for children that were established by American radicals during the 1900 to 1920 period. Their basic intent was to counteract the individualistic, competitive, nationalistic, militaristic, and anti-working class themes that seemed to be prevalent in contemporary public schools and other social institutions. This study utilizes archival collections, old newspapers and journals, and oral and written interviews with former participants to describe the historical development and nature of the more than one hundred English-speaking ""Socialist Sunday schools"" that were established in sixty-five cities and towns. The most notable schools were organized in New York City, Rochester, Buffalo, Hartford, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Milwaukee. The study also places these schools within the relevant theoretical and historical context by focusing on:  (1) current curricular debates about the sociology of school knowledge and notions of critical pedagogy; and (2) the socialist and educational climate from which the Socialist Sunday schools emerged.    Of particular interest are the actual curriculum materials and activities that were utilized by these American socialists educators. Included in this study are descriptions and analyses of the lecture outlines, readers, magazines, recitations, songs, plays, etc. that comprised the curriculum of the Socialist Sunday schools. While these materials represented a diversity of perspectives on teaching, they were all strongly guided by an allegiance to working-class interests and to the encouragement of a critical perspective toward contemporary ideological and material relations. In essence, Socialist Sunday School curriculum can be viewed as outside both the traditional and progressive educational camps of the period, as oppositional school knowledge toward the dominant perspectives of American culture. The study concludes with a brief exploration of the ways in which this research helps to address:  (1) historiographical issues about the nature of revisionist scholarship; (2) curricular concerns about the nature of the selective tradition; and (3) pedagogical discussions about the nature of critical teaching.",0
"MUSIC THEORISTS OF THE BOHEMIAN REFORMATION; TRANSLATION AND CRITIQUE OF THE TREATISES OF JAN BLAHOSLAV AND JAN JOSQUIN (CZECHOSLOVAKIA, RENAISSANCE, MORAVIA)","Few Western scholars have pursued the topic of music in Renaissance Bohemia-Moravia, and the musical interaction between the theorists of Bohemia-Moravia and Wittenberg has largely been ignored.    The Jednota bratrska, a Protestant sect that flourished in Bohemia-Moravia between 1457 and 1620, published eleven monophonic hymnals, a complete Bible, a Czech grammar, and a Czech speller. Jan Blahoslav and Jan Josquin, members of the Jednota bratrska, wrote the first music treatises in Czech, the only music texts known to have been written by Protestants during the Czech Renaissance.    The primary purpose of this dissertation is to present Blahoslav's Musica (1558) and the surviving portion of Josquin's Muzika (1561) in English translation. The most obvious necessity for the translation is that no music treatise written in sixteenth-century Czech had been translated into English or into any other language prior to this study.    Part I of this dissertation begins with an overview of the political and religious situation during the Bohemian Reformation. Next, it presents a biography of the Jednota bishop Jan Blahoslav. Because the author of the Muzika has not yet been conclusively identified, it presents a summation of the major arguments regarding the identity of Jan Josquin as well as biographical information about the most likely candidate, the Jednota priest Vaclav Solin. Part I concludes with a discussion of the theoretical concepts presented in the treatises and the identification of the probable sources of ideas and illustrations. Although Blahoslav mentions an indebtedness to only Hermann Finck and Adrianus Petit Coclico, this discussion shows that Blahoslav also borrowed heavily from Nikolaus Listenius and, to a lesser extent, Vaclav Philomathes. Although Josquin did not mention an indebtedness to any theorist, this discussion shows that the Muzika is modeled after the treatises of Blahoslav and Listenius.    Part II of this dissertation begins with technical information regarding the editions of the treatises and the procedures employed in preparing the transcriptions and translations. Modern Czech-English editions of Blahoslav's Musica and Josquin's Muzika then follow. Photocopies of the original documents are included in appendices to make comparison possible.",0
"MEXICO'S INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE BELLAS ARTES: AN ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL IMPACT ON PROGRAMMING AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE CORO DE CAMARA DE BELLAS ARTES (ARTS ADMINISTRATION, CHORAL MUSIC, CULTURE)","The purpose of this study was to investigate and describe the development, organization and programs of Mexico's National Institute of Fine Arts. The focus of the study was the Music Division of the National Institute of Fine Arts with emphasis on the role of the Coro de Camara de Bellas Artes in fulfilling the goals and objectives outlined in national educational policy.    The study addressed the problem of expanding current knowledge about the role of the arts in Mexico's national education programs. Patterns of official patronage for the performing arts were traced from their roots in the blending of Aztec and European cultures through the establishment of the National Institute of Fine Arts. Primary educational objectives forming the basis for federal arts programming in Mexico were identified and the resulting impact on specific programmatic elements was described.    Using the Coro de Camara de Bellas Artes as a primary example, an investigation of programmatic elements was made in order to ascertain the impact of national educational guidelines on artistic program development. One significant aspect of that impact was the acquisition of the Jesus Sanchez Garza collection. The collection contains 276 original manuscripts by Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Mexican composers of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The National Institute published thirteen of these compositions in Volume II of the Tesoro de la Musica Polifonica en Mexico.    The study further revealed a pattern of governmental support for the arts which is national in scope and firmly linked to the concept of education as a lifelong process.",0
"WHEN THE HERO TELLS THE TALE: NARRATIVE STUDIES IN THE LATE-MEDIEVAL ""MINNEREDE""","This narrative study of Ulrich von Lichtenstein's Frauendienst, Die Minneburg, and Hermann von Sachsenheim's Die Morin explores how composers adapted the narrative conventions of performance, so prevalent in Arthurian Romance, to the first-person narrative structures inherent in the late-medieval Minnerede-tradition. All three narrators alter narrational gestures and source references to relfect their common identity with the hero. The combination of an active, authoritative narrator with the generically neutral observer-persona of Minnereden engenders the division of the Ich into two or more first-person personae, who act according to the dictates of type (the knight, the helpless lover, the composer, the storyteller, the witness) within clearly definable narrational modes. Composers of Minnereden used the potential contrast between these personae to develop didactic themes and to demonstrate their virtuosity.    The introduction of the composer-persona into the story, along with texts of his songs or reden, transforms epic-length Minnereden into showpieces of the composer's skill and emphasizes the role of composition within the paradigm of courtly service. Ulrich's Frauendienst redefines this paradigm from chivalry and Minnesang to the acts of singing and telling. In the epilogue he offers her masterpiece as the ultimate proof of this service. The fate of the unrequited lover accompanies the tale of Minne's education in Die Minneburg and thereby provides a casuistic dimension to the authoritative and unenlightened perspectives provided by the storyteller- and hero-personae. These different roles conflate in the fragmentary Minnegericht, where Minne presides over judgments concerning the lover-persona's miseries. The evolution of the hero's role in Die Morin from knight and courtly lover to bringer of fremde mer combines with the ascendancy of Fraw Aubentur, invented within the story by the hero himself, to glorify the act of composition as superior to both love and courtly service. While Minnereden do not evince oeuvre-status comparable to that of Dante's Vita Nuova, they do emerge in this study as the primary literary context for the composer's self-portrayal in late-medieval German literature.",0
"A PRELIMINARY CATALOGUE AND EDITION OF GERMAN FOLK BALLADS: THE TEST OF A THEMATIC CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ON 187 NARRATIVE FOLKSONG TYPES (FOLKLORE, BROADSIDES)","After more than two centuries of intensive collecting, folksong scholars still face the basic problem of controlling their material. Unlike folktale scholarship, which has long enjoyed such works as the Aarne-Thompson Types of the Folktale to facilitate international comparative research, folk ballad investigation has been impeded by the lack of effective classificatory schemes. To elaborate an ""International Ballad Index,"" ballad scholars have regularly held Arbeitstagungen uber Fragen des Typenindex der europaischen Volksballaden. Of the two dominant, competing proposals, the ""Freiburg System"" attempts to arrange whole-ballad types in linear and sequential relationships, while the ""Wilgus-Long System"" attempts to classify ballad themes in logical and multiple relationships.    The dissertation develops effective solutions to such dilemmas by combining systems of classification and arrangement. It then tests them successfully on approximately 10,000 ballad variants from the entire German-speaking world. The work functions as a pilot study for the full Katalog deutscher Erzahllieder, in preparation, which treats the gamut of German folk balladry.    After first presenting a survey of ballad editions and classificatory systems, I address some basic considerations about ballads, develop concepts to treat complex ballad thematics, and then I elaborate specific methods for discovering and inspecting particular ballads.    The Catalogue's classification system grows directly out of the data and proceeds from description (song resumes), through a mixture of description and classification (""narrative units""), to classification (""thematic units""). Since it is the interaction of actions and actors which best defines ballad narratives, the multifaceted approach classifies song themes in two different but basic ways: a detailed classification by themes narrated in actions and events (""thematic"" and ""narrative units"") in one dimension and by character relationships in the other (""classes of dramatis personae""). Each part of the system reinforces the others to enable swift and precise access to the material without compromising either the integrity of the ballads as entities or the richness of potential thematic connections.    In the edition I apply the system of arrangement to the data base, giving for each ballad a thorough narrative description, titles, first lines, number and distribution of reports, foreign parallels, secondary research, bibliography and an example.",0
THE POETRY OF MIKOLAJ SEP-SZARZYNSKI: AN INTRODUCTION AND CRITICAL TRANSLATION,"Mikolaj Sep-Szarzynski is one of the most disturbingly enigmatic figures in all Polish literature. Criticism has been complicated by several facts surrounding both his life and his poetry. Few biograph- ical facts are certain, and his extant poetry accounts for only a small amount of his total oeuvre. Problems are compounded by discrep- ancies in canon, a lack of primary sources of his texts, and the difficulties inherent in establishing his proper place in the periodization of Polish literature.    Attempting to plumb the contradictory nature of existence, the poet, in his psalmic adaptations, songs and sonnets, explores the various conflicts of his own troubled soul. Thematically, Sep-Szarzynski's mature poetry outlines his transcendent search for God, a search which is ultimately inconclusive. In a more general sense, however, Rytmy abo wiersze polskie represents one of the first examples in Polish literature of the breakdown of Renaissance Neoplatonism. Characterized by a philosophy that presages the rejection of the anthropocentric optimism of the Renaissance, Sep-Szarzynski's poetry announces the theocentric pessimism which will later come to be identified with the Baroque proper.    As a poet living in an important transitional phase of Polish history, Sep-Szarzynski created a poetry that is made up of several conflicting formal qualities. In terms of imagery and metrical struc- ture, his verse invariably repeats the harmonious aspects that typify the poetry of Kochanowski; internally, however, several opposing elements function in counterpoint to break down the order that pervades the superficial constructs of his poetry. Clever manipu- lation of syntax, grammar, sound and voice provides the disruptive factor to implicitly suggest the poet's own private dilemmas.    In translating Sep-Szarzynski into English, careful analysis has been made of all possible sources of his poetry. A thorough examination has first been made of the original edition of 1601. After critically assessing all subsequent editions of Sep-Szarzynski's poetry, a new modern Polish version has been created. The English translation of the all poems which can be definitely ascribed to the author strives, above all, for accuracy of meaning often at the expense of style.",0
"AN INVESTIGATION OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MUSICAL APTITUDE, GENERAL MUSICAL ACHIEVEMENT, ATTITUDE TOWARD MUSIC, SCHOOL MUSIC PARTICIPATION, SCHOOL MUSIC ACHIEVEMENT, AND STUDENTS' OUTSIDE-OF-SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IN A RURAL, ETHNIC COMMUNITY","The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of relationships that exist between selected outside-of-school factors in a rural, ethnic community and five musical characteristics: musical aptitude, general musical achievement, attitude toward music, differential participation in school music activities, and teacher ratings for achievement in school music activities. The subjects of the investigation were 169 fourth through twelfth grade students who attend school in a rural, predominantly German-Mennonite community.    A Survey of Musical Environment was constructed by the investigator to obtain data regarding nine demographic characteristics and 107 outside-of-school, musical and nonmusical factors. Standardized, academic achievement test scores and IQ scores were obtained from school records. Data were submitted to four kinds of statistical analysis: frequency distribution, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, and discriminant analysis.    Results of data analysis revealed strong relationships between general musical achievement and the following: musical aptitude, home musical environment, outside-of-school instrumental music activities, level of school music participation, instrumental music training, and self appraisal of musical skills. Strong relationships were found between level of school music participation and the following: home musical environment, attitude toward school musical activities, self appraisal of musical skills, and grade level. There was a strong relationship between teacher ratings for grade school classroom music and outside-of-school singing activities, and between teacher ratings for high school choir and the following: home musical environment and church affiliation.    The results were inconclusive regarding the relationship of outside-of-school environmental factors to musical aptitude, attitude toward music, and teacher band ratings; further, the results did not support a strong role for heredity in musical aptitude.    Musical aptitude, general musical achievement, and attitude toward music were reported to be little-related to frequency of participation in nonmusical activities and little-related to frequency of listening to preferred styles of music on radios, stereos, tape recorders, and televisions.    Results from the present investigation revealed that the community maintains a cultural tradition of positive attitudes toward music in general and toward school music instruction in particular.",0
"""MUSIQUE DE SCENE POUR LES CHANSONS DE BILITIS"" BY CLAUDE DEBUSSY ON POEMS BY PIERRE LOUYS, A LECTURE RECITAL, TOGETHER WITH THREE RECITALS OFSELECTED WORKS OF J. S. BACH, S. PROKOFIEV, J. FRANCAIX, W. PISTON, L. V. BEETHOVEN, AND OTHERS","The incidental music for Chansons de Bilitis is little known and rarely performed. However, the relegation of this work to the realms of obscurity is highly unjustified. Chansons de Bilitis requires an unusual combination of instruments: two flutes, two harps, and celesta in addition to a reciter. The work is a theater piece in the tradition of melodrama, with spoken text and background music in alternation. Despite the rather unique nature of the work, many of the melodic, textural, and orchestrational devices for which Debussy is noted are evident. The music is through-composed; each movement mirrors and emphasizes the meaning and mood of the accompanying poem. Because of the fragmentary nature of the music and its rather subordinate role in the total theater work, the primary emphasis in gaining an appreciation of the value of the work lies in an investigation of its historical background.    Chansons de Bilitis, a series of 143 poems in prose, was one of the most celebrated literary hoaxes of the nineteenth century. While the volume was purported to be a French translation of an ancient Greek poetess of the sixth century B. C. named Bilitis, the poems were in fact composed by Pierre Louys. Debussy wrote incidental music for twelve of the poems which were to be recited and mimed. The work was premiered on February 7, 1901, with Debussy performing at the celesta.    In 1914, Debussy arranged six of the pieces from the incidental music under the title Six Epigraphes Antiques for both piano duet and piano solo.",0
"A STUDY OF THE NGADHA TEXT TRADITION: A LINGUISTIC INVESTIGATION OF THE COLLECTIVE MIND OF THE NGADHA PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND OF FLORES, INDONESIA","The structure of an oral narrative text is examined in order to discover the strategies used by the narrator in the building of the text. The main body of data under analysis is a traditional Ngadha legend entitled ""The legend of Penu and Vegu the orphan"" which has been taped, transcribed, translated, and put into writing for the first time. Additional data presented in this study are the Ngadha goo-laba (bronze gongs and skin drums) music and a traditional song. The objective of the study is to extract the principles of order and coherence from the diverse realms of social thought and action, whether they be manifest in language, text structure, rituals, concepts of time and space, attitudes connected with the social relations and place of individuals in the society, or the symbolisms contained in the text, ritual music and song.    The thesis is concerned primarily with collective representations manifest in language, in the text and its performance, and the social discourse that it evokes. The text under analysis is viewed as a form of knowledge handed down from generation to generation by word-of-mouth and the content and symbolisms contained in it reflect the collective mind and imagination of the Ngadha people. The secondary purpose of the study is to present the basic mechanisms of the Ngadha grammar.    The dissertation is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 describes the old tradition of Ngadha and the goals of the dissertation. It summarizes the consecutive chapters in the dissertation and presents a brief review of some literature within linguistics, literary criticism and anthropology that serve as a theoretical background of the study. Chapter 2 presents the text, ""The legend of Penu and Vegu the orphan"" and its translations (i.e. morpheme-by-morpheme gloss and free translation in English). Some background about the story-teller, the performance setting, and the conventions adopted for the transcription and gloss of the text is included. Chapter 3 presents a sketch grammar of the Ngadha language. The sketch grammar is meant to provide a foundation for the discussion of the higher level structure of the legend text (presented in Chapter 4) and to introduce the reader to the basic mechanisms of the grammar of the Ngadha language. Chapter 4 presents the higher level structures of the legend text. The analysis is concerned with the coherence systems which provide the basic framework of the text (i.e. time, location, and identity), the interplay between the story world and the real world, and the episodic and paragraph subdivisions of the text. Finally, the Appendices consist of three parts: Appendix I presents the calendrical systems which explain the traditional Ngadha concept of time, Appendix II presents a brief description of the goo-laba ensemble and music, and Appendix III presents a brief analysis of a traditional Ngadha song (The song of the indigo rooster).",0
THE CONGO RITUAL OF NORTHEASTERN PANAMA: AN AFRO-AMERICAN EXPRESSIVE STRUCTURE OF CULTURAL ADAPTATION,"Complex studies of Afro-American rituals are rare. The Congo of northeastern Panama represents a large-scale ritual performed by Spanish-speaking Blacks who inhabit eight small towns comprising the area called Costa Arriba. The ritual has a long tradition, reflecting tropical forest and coastal adaptations by Blacks in northeastern Panama. It demonstrates a remarkable integration of lifeways expressing basic ecological, social, and cosmological themes of the society, integrating elements of diverse origin into a distinctive configuration representative of the continuity of Afro-American forms.    Discussion of the setting, ethnohistory, and contemporary town life of Blacks in this region provide background information for placing Congo ritual in an ecological, historical, and social context. The Secular society of Costa Arriba is maritime-forest oriented, egalitarian and individualistic, and based on an ideology of balanced reciprocity where humans interact with supernatural beings through mediators. By contrast, Congo ritual generates a sacred societal structure that is coastal oriented with a hierarchical organization; formal patterns of redistribution and direct contact with malevolent supernatural beings characterized redistributive exchange and interpersonal relations.    Ritual reproduces a view of the world by integrating themes related to natural, social, and supernatural spheres. Congo is an expressive structure composed of underlying thematic representations and their transmission in sacred society. These themes, seen as sets of contrastive categories, include coast-forest dichotomy, wet-dry seasonality, kin and non-kin bases for exchange, male-female opposition, and benevolent versus malevolent beings. Relationships between the contrastive categories and spheres are seen through a distinct integration of elements and themes. They are embodied and expressed in ritual through replication, reversal, and exaggeration, and transmitted by ritual performers through expressive modes of role performance, song, dance, dialect, and ritual paraphernalia.    Congo ritual reflects cultural adaptation and is itself an adaptable cultural form. An analysis of processes of integration and segregation reveal the means by which ritual is a mechanism of Black adaptation in the sacred and secular societies. Ritual enactment, characteristic of the dry season, and reflecting differences between wet and dry season elements, orients people to different seasonal activities. Social and ecological integration are seen in social relations and exchange. Social relations themselves are represented in ritual forms and activated during ritual performance. Congo ritual is also a social occasion for exchange of goods within and between Congo societies and is an important mechanism of redistribution of resources in ritual and secular contexts. Social segregation is expressed by the distinct pattern of lifeways in Congo ritual that separates Blacks from other populations.    Congo, as an outlet for hostility and aggression, promotes social solidarity in the egalitarian, individualistic secular society. It expresses a similar ideological basis for social and economic interaction and reinforces an ethnic identity and boundary. Ritual participation, in light of recent economic and social changes, continues to provide a primary means for interaction and exchange on a local and regional scale.",0
"Educational Activities of the Early Italians in Buffalo, New York","Woodrow Wilson once said;: ""America is nothing if it consists of each of us. It is something if it consists of all of us.” Perhaps that helps to explain why America is frequently referred to as the ""melting pot."" This term suggests that all of the peoples who came to America merged and became one. Yet this is not wholly true. Each immigrant strain has contributed something to America’s culture but these various contributions still remain quite distinct and separate. It is these contributions that help make America the unique entity that she is.America has long been the destination of the great number of people who yearn for political freedom, economic betterment, and religious liberty. Last of the great streams of immigration were those people who came from Italy. They flowed into America in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. As the last-comers, the Italians found themselves forced to compete with nationalities already firmly established in American economic life. Many of them settled in the city of Buffalo where jobs and their countrymen waited to greet them. They brought with them from their homeland many customs which they were eager to share with others. In turn, they desired to be accepted by their new neighbors. They wanted to become Americans - good Americans. This process involved a long and often tedious struggle.What did the Italian immigrant do to hasten the process of Americanization? How did he win for himself and his children a place in the American way of life? Did any organizations play an important role in his orientation and assimilation into American society?This study was written in an attempt to answer the question: ”What were the major educational activities that served to help the early Italian immigrants within the city of Buffalo to become an integral part of America?” (a) Did they establish schools where a formal education might be obtained? (b) Did they form organizations to spread education and culture in an informal manner?Buffalo is a cosmopolitan city. With the opening of the Erie Barge Canal, it became the gateway to the West. Through it passed multitudes of immigrant pioneers on their way to the new farms and cities being developed there. Thousands of these people got off the crowded canal boats to settle in Buffalo. Soon the immigrants were here in large numbers, having brought with them not only their willing hands, varied skills, and the meager possessions carried in a sack or trunk, but also their songs, cookery, language, their stories and folkways, their churches and schools. A series of studies describing the educational activities of the various immigrant peoples of Buffalo would prove of interest for it would give an over-all picture of the educational facilities created by these people. At the same time, an appreciation of their struggle to be accepted by their adopted land would be presented. When this problem was selected, a study describing the educational activities of the early Germans in Buffalo and one about the early Buffalo Poles were already among the thesis exploration of the Department of Education at Canisius College. This study is intended to continue the series. Although several studies have been made concerning the Italians in Buffalo, none of the historical nature were to be found in the graduate department of the New York State College for Teachers or in the University of Buffalo.",0
Exploring the Use of iPads for Literacy Instruction in the 1:1 K-6 Classroom,"This non-experimental correlational quantitative study was designed to explore the effects of specialized professional development, age, gender, and years of teaching experience on the successful integration of iPads into classroom literacy education among K-6 students. The study uses the teachers’ Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) scores to measure the successful integration of the iPads. Much research has been completed exploring the implementation of various technologies into the classroom. With the advent of the iPad in 2010, and Apple Inc.’s eagerness to include their product in the classroom, it was inevitable that mobile tablet technology would be added to the public school classroom. The researcher chose to study K-6 teachers at three elementary schools in the Coachella Valley Unified School District (CVUSD). The CVUSD implemented a 1:1 iPad integration program throughout in 2012, providing an iPad for every student at every grade level in the district. CVUSD was the first district in the United States to implement such a program. The K-6 teacher population was narrowed to teachers who teach age-appropriate literacy skills regularly in the classroom, removing Art, Music, Physical Education, and English Language Learner (ELL) instructors from the population. The repeatedly validated instrument, The Survey of Preservice Teachers' Knowledge of Teaching and Technology, was used to find the TPACK of the teachers in the final sample. This instrument has been repeatedly validated for both pre- and in-service teachers. The scores were analyzed using the Pearson’s ? correlation coefficient to discover whether or not there was a significant positive or negative correlation between the TPACK score and its subdomains and the amount of specialized professional development, the age, the gender, and the years of teaching experience of the teacher. Using the Spearman’s ? and the Two-Tailed test to cross-check the results, the researcher found no significant positive or negative correlation between the teachers’ TPACK scores and the studied variables. One research and one practical recommendation have been suggested by the researchers. A follow-up study using a school or district that has not instituted a 1:1 iPad program wherein the research team would implement a program and follow the progress of the program for 1 to 3 years and improving professional development programs to include detailed and immersive modules for integrating technology into the classroom and into the lessons.",0
The Effect of Contemplation Meditation on the Psychological Well-Being of a Group of Adolescents.,"The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a contemplation meditation intervention aimed at developing great compassion on the psychological well-being of a group of adolescents. A supporting aim of this study was to elucidate conceptualisations of psychological well-being and contemplation meditation (Mahayana Buddhist analytical meditation and placement meditation) theory.The subjects of happiness and well-being have been focused upon in the East for thousands of years in philosophical theorisation and methodology (e.g. Buddhism) (Gyatso, 1995, 2000, 2001a, 2002a, 2005, 2007, 2010). In the West, although comparatively lagging behind, there has been increased interest in these topics since the advent of positive psychology (Compton, 2005; Peterson & Seligman, 2004; Ryff & Singer, 2008). In the past two decades, Eastern wisdom has also become more incorporated into Western psychology. For example, mindfulness meditation has been extensively integrated into Western stress reduction and clinical therapies (e.g. Kabat-Zinn, 1982, 2003, 2009; Schroevers & Brandsma, 2010). Less is known, however, about other forms of meditation, particularly contemplation meditation. Specifically, Mahayana Buddhist theory explains that contemplation and meditation on compassion and wisdom leads to permanent inner peace and optimal happiness, which has largely been overlooked in psychology.Furthermore, regarding Western positive mental health interventions, there is still limited research on how to foster well-being specifically in adolescents. Moreover, Huebner and Diener (2008) have noted that subjective well-being research in adults exceeds subjective well-being research in youth. Additionally, there is minimal research on psychological well-being as understood from the eudaimonic perspective, in comparison to hedonic subjective well-being (Keyes, 2009). The present study thus attempts to expand knowledge on increasing psychological well-being in adolescents by also drawing on Eastern theorisation and methodology.To meet the aims of the study, a quantitative research design was implemented. The participants were predominantly white English speaking adolescents (15 – 17 years old) from four high schools in England. It involved a basic experimental design including an experimental group who received weekly contemplation meditation training, and a control group who received a weekly reading from the book Authentic Happiness (Seligman, 2002). Both groups completed questionnaires to ascertain overall psychological well-being before and after the interventions. Measuring instruments included a biographical questionnaire, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), the PANAS-C (Laurent et al., 1999), and Ryff’s scales of psychological well-being (Ryff, 1989; Ryff & Singer, 1996). A mixed design ANOVA was conducted examining time (pre- and post- scores) for the with in subjects effect (whole group), and time-group (control and experimental groups) for the between-subjects effect. Gender, schools, and the number of meditation classes attended were included in the statistical analysis.The results indicated that adolescents who received the contemplation meditation training experienced a significantly greater increase in environmental mastery and personal growth in comparison to the control group. There was also a significant decrease in negative affect for the girls in the experimental group in comparison to boys in the experimental group. Furthermore, all of the participants (both the experimental and control groups) showed a significant increase in life satisfaction, environmental mastery, autonomy, purpose in life, and self-acceptance after the interventions. No significant changes were found in positive affect and positive relations with others.",0
The relationship between liturgical practice and spirituality in the Church of the Nazarene with special reference to John Wesley's doctrine of Christian perfection,"Problem    The Church of the Nazarene, following the pattern of the American holiness movement that gave it birth, adopted a modified version of Wesley’s doctrine of Christian perfection. During the early years of the denomination Christian perfection was promoted feverishly through revivalism and worship structured after the camp meeting model; however, over time the promotion and propagation of holiness began to wane. Currently, the belief in and pursuit of inward holiness among both clergy and laity are rapidly vanishing. For more than a decade scholars and denominational leaders have recognized that this loss of spiritual vitality has placed the Church of the Nazarene in a theological identity crisis. Although theories abound in an attempt to explain the loss of Nazarene identity and the resulting decay in spirituality, the problem is most likely multifaceted.    Some of the most significant contributors to the loss of spirituality and Nazarene identity are those deficiencies in liturgical practice resulting from the culmination of several factors including: the denomination’s rejection of prayer book worship, the failure to develop a robust liturgical and sacramental theology, and the demise of revivalism. This historical progression has resulted in a vacuum in Nazarene liturgical practice, which has had immense ramifications for spirituality. Due to the nature of this problem the purpose of this study was to examine liturgical practice within the Church of the Nazarene and evaluate its relationship to spirituality.    Method    The empirical research was preceded by an extensive historical literature review which examined the liturgical transformation that occurred between John Wesley’s liturgical thought and practice to the worship practices in the Church of the Nazarene. To study current worship practices, two surveys were developed. The Pastoral Survey was used to determine the shape of the liturgy in the Church of the Nazarene by grouping each worshipping congregation into one of three categories based upon the level of prayer book influence in that congregation’s liturgy. The Congregational Survey measured the relationship between liturgical practice and spirituality.    A sample of 144 English-speaking Nazarene churches was selected using stratified cluster sampling. Churches from each cluster were randomly selected with the intention of procuring 72 churches for the study. In reality only 65 pastors agreed to participate. Surveys, pencils, detailed instructions for administering the survey, and prepaid return postage were mailed to all participating churches. Useable surveys from pastors and 1,550 congregants in 53 churches were returned. In order to answer the research questions, data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t tests, and analysis of variance.    Results    Three types of Nazarene liturgy, based upon the level of prayer book influence that pastors incorporated into the worship structure, emerged from the study. Type I congregations exhibit insignificant prayer book influence, Type II congregations demonstrate minimal prayer book influence, and Type III congregations exhibit distinct characteristics of prayer book worship. The vast majority of Nazarene congregations are Type I; only a small percentage of worshipping congregations fall into the Type III category.    The majority of Nazarenes find written prayers and the reciting of creeds in public worship of minimal value to their spirituality; whereas the vast majority of subjects believe the congregational singing of the church is vital in their ability to experience intimacy with God. The study also revealed that while the vast majority of Nazarenes believe that they love God completely, only one-third of that number agreed that carnal pride was absent from their heart. Likewise, more than one-third of Nazarenes feel that their own personal relationship with God stands apart from any official teaching of the church, and a similar percentage believe that one can be Christian without regularly attending church. Nearly half of all subjects think that their personal devotional life is more important than corporate worship. Differences between the three liturgical types in the spirituality variable were minimal.    Conclusions    The insubstantial prayer book influence upon Nazarene worship appears to be the result of the spirit of anti-ritualism that plagues the church. It seems these sentiments have also led to an impoverished Nazarene sacramental practice. The desire for inward-focused experiential worship has placed overly subjective practices at the forefront of worship and marginalized the enduring practices of Christian antiquity that potentially serve therapeutically as means of grace for the healing of the sin-sick soul. This has led to an incongruity that is most notably evinced in both the desire for autonomy and the confusion over the issue of sin and its relationship to the experience of Christian perfection. Rather than countering the negative influences of culture and promoting a robust spirituality consistent with classical Wesleyanism, it appears that the liturgy of the vast majority of Nazarene congregations is fostering an aberrant form of spirituality.",0
Con Cojones y Maestria: Un Estudio Sociologico-Agronomico Acerca Del Desarrollo Rural Endogeno y Procesos De Localizacion En La Sierra De La Contraviesa (Espana),"The present volume is concerned with the development problems and prospects of the Contraviesa mountains in Southern Spain. Situated parallel to the Mediterranean Sea, the mountain reach heights of 1,500 meters. The region constitutes the lower part of the Alpujarra region of Granada province, Andalusia. The main economic activity is dryland farming producing perennial crops, such as wine grapes, almonds and figs. Socioeconomically, the area belongs to the category generally labelled 'marginal'. Indicators commonly used to define this category are also present in the Contraviesa and include the out-migration of young people, poor infrastructure, its isolated setting and unfavourable natural conditions - such as steep slopes, poor soil, a low annual rainfall, 350 and 600 millimetres, with signs of a downward trend. It is generally considered that these natural conditions make the region unfit for agriculture as a source of regional development. The present study challenges this position, by exploring alternative strategies for socio-economic development drawing upon agriculture and other local resources.The central theme of this socio-agronomic study is enlarging the design capacity to cope with the problems of rural and agrarian development. Special prominence is given to those development processes, areas, activities and groups of people which tend to be overlooked, undervalued and as a result dismissed as marginal. It is argued that these factors are crucial to locating alternative ways for development. In this study these elements - the 'unnoticed' - will be examined as follows:1. theoretically (globalization, localization, diversity; see Chapters 1 and 7);2. empirically (statistics, management of natural resources, farming styles, development interventions, collective actions of the local community; see Chapters 2-6)3. exploratory (design capacity, creativity, experiments, redundancy, analysis versus synthesis; see Chapter 7).On theory: Globalization, localization, diversityChapter 1 begins with a theoretical discussion of the processes of globalization and localization. Globalization should not be seen as a structural phenomenon exerting a decisive influence on the local level, rather, both globalization and localization are processes generating the rules for interaction between localities. Accordingly, I use the term localization (which I equate with endogenous development) when, on a given issue, a nondominant locality (or the 'local') is able to exercise a decisive influence over a dominant locality (a 'globality', or the 'global'). In my research, I have used an actor-oriented approach to trace the processes involved. It is an approach particularly suited to this type of inquiry.There is an urgent need to re-examine the agricultural activities of marginal-level areas. These activities are frequently dismissed as being of limited development potential. This is particularly the case when the agro-food complex is analysed from a structuralist perspective in which local agricultural developments are seen as being primarily determined by the mechanisms of international markets and State interventions. In this study I wish to highlight the heterogeneity of agricultural activities, and stress the particular ways in which farmers organize their labour processes with respect to markets, their land and the State. Such organisational arrangements are called farming styles. They refer to sets of culturally-shared notions on how farming activities should be carried out. Local knowledge of natural resource management is embedded in these notions. The concept of farming style is thought to be helpful in understanding and explaining the coherency of farming activities. The fact that it is far from easy to gain insight into this question may well explain why non-farming outsiders, such as agronomists, sociologists and politicians, tend to mistake a farming performance for a farm plan (see Richards, 1995).I devise a theoretical model to facilitate the explanation the generation of diversity (used as a synonym for heterogeneity), a process that is at best poorly understood. The notions of plan, performance and context are central to the model developed and are combined with central elements of Giddens' structuration theory. The plans of actors interact with their specific contexts and crystallize into temporary performances, which in turn modify both plans and contexts. In this way, actors weave together plans, contexts and performances, threads that may at a particular moment intersect with the threads of other actors. At this intersection, projects interlock and joint performances are generated.In translating a plan into a performance, actors draw not only on their knowledgeability and capability, but also on their creativity. Creativity is considered to be the third formal property of actors. Creativity implies the capacity to perceive the relevance of aspects of the context with regard to the plan. While in the case of intended action unacknowledged conditions are bound to generate diversity, the creative capacity of an actor is bound to create diversity. However, although a lot is known about the creative processes of acclaimed geniuses, much less is known about the day to day creations and discoveries of 'ordinary people', like farmers, and this is what the farming styles concept intends to contribute to. Discoveries imply authorship and processes of authorization (see Schaffer, 1994). Accordingly, creating and generating diversity are processes that can only take place when there is social interaction. This applies not only to the diversity found in the farming world, but also to the range of alternative approaches towards development issues and different scientific views on these approaches. This situation has important methodological consequences. In my case, I have choosen to use a combination of participant observation, semi-structured interviewing, and extensive case studies. This, then, leads us to the empirical part.The empirical material: statistics, natural resource management, farming styles, development interventions, local collective actionChapter 2 reviews the statistical data available on demography, employment, external economic dependence and land tenure in the Contraviesa. From the figures two major conclusions may be drawn. First, although the Contraviesa, in spite of being a marginallevel area, it is far less dependent on external subsidies than is commonly believed. On the contrary, it would appear that agriculturally much richer areas such as in Seville province are much more dependent on external financing. In 1992, subsidies accounted for less than 5,5 per cent of total farming income, whereas in Seville this figure was 37 per cent. Second, the massive out-migration, which began in the 1950's, has not made agricultural society apathetic, as might be expected, but even more dynamic, especially so until the early 1980's.In Chapter 3 the dynamic tendencies apparent in Contraviesa society are elaborated futher, as part of an historic overview of the management of natural resources during the past century. The descriptions provided are mainly based on primary data, collected using ethno-ecological techniques. Three important issues are highlighted in this summary. First, the importance of the way farmers exchange genetic material is discussed. Farmers do this very selectively: they go to a particular place, and deal with particular people to obtain particular seed. This leads us to hypothesize the existence of a relatively dense network of places where seed of a specific quality is produced; along in this network, seed is transported from one place to another. The term 'crop stops' is coined here, demonstrating how seed 'embarks' on a journey along the network 'alighting' at specific 'stops'. Once seeds have 'disembarked' they are cropped and embedded according to local agricultural practices. A 'crop stop' serves as a climate chamber, an environment where seed is given the chance to adapt, phenotypically, to the new conditions. These new natural conditions may give rise to new genetic qualities, and at such moment the climate chamber takes on the character of a delivery room. Thus, the exchange of genetic material may be seen as a system of phenotypic performances according to a genetic plan within a changing context. In other words, the theoretical model which was suggested in Chapter 1 to explain the generation of diversity, also proves useful in the field of natural sciences.Chapter 3 also deals with moruna (Vicia articulata Hornem.), a vetch used locally as a green manure and animal feed. The legume is largely absent from agronomic literature despite its usefulness for sustainable agroecosystem design. However, farmers of the so-called High Alpujarra have long recognized this potential. They use seed from the Contraviesa to enhance soil fertility in irrigated horticultural rotations. This organic dependence is a two-way process; farmers from the Contraviesa get barley seed from selected people from the High Alpujarra.Finally, Chapter 3 discusses the melgar reforestation, a farmer concept to counter the erosion processes in the Contraviesa. Melga or merga is an ancient Spanish word embedded in farmer discourse that refers to small 'spots' on the land of minor importance to the farmer. Instead of combatting the desertification that currently threatens large parts of Southeastern Spain by developing minimum-size tree plantations as is done at present by the Andalusian administration, melgar reforestation proposes a to reforest (very) small patches of land. It is argued that this allows farmers to integrate economic with ecological interests more efficiently and tha practice may also be relevant from a metapopulation theoretical perspective.Chapter 4 deals extensively with the development of different farming styles and links with the earlier mentioned farming dynamism that enabled people to respond to successive crisis by drawing upon the local cultural repertoire. Massive outmigration led not only to a social depolarization of the Contraviesa (when both rich and poor fled the region), but it also enabled the emancipation of those at middle and lower socio-economic levels, who now focused on making their dream becoming a labrador come true. This term refers to a regional farming style that has served as a reference point for farm development over the years. Key aspects of this style include trying to achieve a farm size that would be big enough to produce viable farms for sons and daughters even after a subdivision into heritable parts (the heritage farm)-, the development of as wide an array of products such wine, almonds, figs, cereals, legume species, different types of livestock, vegetables and olives as possible to secure self sufficiency and the determination to achieve as much autonomy as possible from the market and the State.Gradually, two major farming styles evolved from the regional labrador farming style. One is the anchura type labrador, who emphasize spreading risks and lowering labour costs at the expense of a constant product quality and quantity. The other is the constancia type labrador who emphasizes doing farm jobs at the right moment in order to obtain good and constant quality and quantity involving considerable labour costs, even in years when the harvest is expected to fail. Temporary migration has often played an important role in the construction of the labrador farms. However, not all households were able to make the labrador ideal come true and some continued to rely on external income. Money is earned by ploughing the land of other farmers (the muleros, the muleteers), or taking on additional non-agricultural jobs (the so-called migrantes, migrants).In the mid-eighties the gradual change in the relative worth of land and labour affects validity of the labrador farm-development project. Other ways had to be found and until the early nineties they were typified by specialisation in vitiviniculture, ecological farming and mechanisation. These elements have been rearranged into new farming perspectives, in an attempt to make the most of local resources. Typically, and contrary to the labrador project, the preferred farm size is one that makes it possible to work with family labour, an area of 10-25 ha, depending on farming style. This tendency, supported by a case study of the recent economic collapse of one of the latifundist type farms, runs counter to beliefs that farming in marginalized areas is only viable when the land base is greatly enlarged. Gradually new farming styles are emerging that seek to link land, labour, technology, markets and the State in new ways. This involves considerable difficulties and many farm housholds are uncertain about how they should proceed. Chapter 4 concludes with a comparison of the economic performance of these different farming styles at househlod and regional level.In chapter 5, recent local initiatives to transcend the labrador autonomy, in order to defend and improve socio-economic conditions in the Contraviesa on a collective basis, are examined. Studies of a neighbourhood assocociation, the Association of Winegrowers and an ecological wine co-operative are presented, whcih show the crucial role played by Summary 361 intermediaries, individuals capable of articulating the local with the global and vice versa, and of translating, adapting and adjusting the global prescriptions to local realities, whenever possible.The lack of intermediaries with these qualities is what currently troubles (semi-)public development interventions, of which Chapter 5 discusses two case studies. One case concerns the Plan for the Improvement of the Almonds, which is an European Union and Spanish state subsidized programme implemented through a nation-wide network of cooperatives. In theory it is meant to increase the productivity of almond groves, but in practice it is little more than an additional source of income for farmers. As the Plan is prescriptive as far as the use of chemical inputs is concerned, it ignores and destroys local potential for the ecological cropping of almonds, using such techniques as green manuring with moruna.The other case is the EU funded LEADER Programme. It is far more diversified and make a real attempt to localize development. However, it has a strong bias towards tourism, to the detriment of support for agriculture. This orientation fails to take into account the importance of agriculture for the reproduction of the landscape, the main touristic resource. Although the Alpujarra LEADER project is a true intermediary between various administrative bodies and the local inhabitants, it demonstrates little capacity to enhance development that proceeds from local strategies, including local agrarian strategies. Instead of strenghtening and building on pluriactivity at the household level, the inherent lack of awareness of farming provokes pluriactivity at the regionallevel, reflected by the fact that now tourist areas and agricultural areas are created that have, however, hardly any economic links. A contributory factor here is the emphasis on formal and bureacratic procedures. These are unable to cope with or recognize local development strategies and other local resources that contain development potential and constitute one of the key problems in localizing rural development.This key problem is further elaborated in Chapter 6, which is therefore pivotal in the book. Two case studies are used to document the enormous perseverance agrarian families must develop in order to overcome the numerous administrative, fiscal and sanitary restrictions, that hinder them from applying for financial and other support, to develop their activities. They truly need, as a local saying goes, cojones (balls) and maestria (mastery). The first case study concerns a cheese dairy. The strength of this dairy is precisely its integration of livestock rearing (milk), with the transformation of milk into cheese and direct (local) sale; however, bureaucratic requirements segment these activities along 'industrial' lines, leading to extra costs that weaken the competitive strength of the entreprise, and to the loss of endogenous development potential. This means that paradoxically it is much easier for the cheese dairy to produce the standard 'universal' Gouda cheese than an undocumented, local, traditional fresh cheese.The other case study discusses the evolution and workings of the wine production sector, and emphasizes the different market channels and the difficulties involved in establishing a hall mark that defends the origin of the local wine against imported wine. This is an issue full of conflict for the Contraviesa; farmers have different perspectives and hence different attitudes to what has been knwon since the mid eighties as the 'wine fraude'.Chapter 6 provides evidence of the technical and legal pluralism found in the Contraviesa when it depicts the nature of the conflict between the local and the global, the particular and the universal, between the 'folk ways' and the 'state ways'. This pluralism has given way to and at the same time is constituted by what I coin as evasive manoeuvres ('movimientos de soslayo' in Spanish). Evasive manoeuvres are historically and socially constructed ways of behaviour that are employed strategically to hide from what is perceived as having an adverse effect to one's own position, and to reappear when the coast is clear. Farmers for example claim financial support and protection for the wine sector, but when a registration of the vineyards is proposed to consider the establishment of a 'Denomination of Origen', several are reluctant to cooperate for they fear fiscal consequences. The Alpujarra LEADER programme demands greater local participation, but organizes the formulation of the plans in such a way that local ideas and potential can scarcely be articulated. Invisibility is thus used as a strategic resource. At the same time, both administration and inhabitants intensively try to mobilize those resources that the other wants to hide because they concern strategic assets such as public money and local savings. It is suggested that these manoeuvres are best understood as every days forms of peasant and administrative resistance (cf. Scott, 1985).However, as far as the farmers are concerned, these manoeuvres may work at the household level (clearly related to the dynamism of labrador autonomy), but it is doubtful whether this atomized agency can still be effective in the future. The call for new forms of cooperation is evident, but these are not easily established, as we see in Chapter 5. These need not necesarily take the form of formal collective bodies possessing formal authority but could probably and most importantly be strengthened through a much denser network of intermediaries at the field level capable of translating global prescriptions to local realities and vice versa. Therefore I argue that there is a need for situated authority, i.e. an authority possessed by actors that are knowledgeable, capable and creative in both local and gloal contexts. This is suggested as one one the main ways in which LEADER might develop.The exploration: design capacity, creativity, experimentation, redundancy, analysis versus synthesisImpressed by the capacity of the inhabitants of the Contraviesa to survive, to continue their activities and even to innovate, in chapter 7, I reflect on the constructive and compositional aspects of every day life. I explore several itineraries.First, I reassess the local saying of doing something con cojones y maestria ('with balls and mastery'), then I do the same with notions oiplan and performance as developed in Chapter 1. This brings me to a consideration of the analogy between a farming performance and a jazz performance, and to highlighting five key aspects involved in both activities - rhythm, melody, technical skills, love and a 'feeling for the form'. Mastering these aspects enables a jazz musician and a farmer to improvise, that is, to explore paths and try out things that are not easily recognized or appreciated by non-farming outsiders like scientists (including musicologists and agronomists). The musical notion of a feeling for the form (vormgevoel in Dutch and sentido de forma in Spanish) is equivalent to the notion of farming styles, and leads me to reconsider the importance of goal-orientedness in human activity. However, the designing power that emanates from a clear vision can be blurred by a lack of learning capacity, that in turn will hinder the timely resetting and fine tuning of objectives. I discuss the Greek notion of 'doing a job sistimatikd' as developed by Cretan olive growers and in which love and a learning attitude are crucial. These aspects are usually passed over in systems approaches to agricultural and rural development. Learning, I argue, has a lot to do with the capacity of an actor to recognize elements from his or her context as relevant for his or her plan; it is the ability to see coherence that enables the creation of coherence. In other words, it dwells upon the creativity of actors to appropriate, to deconstruct and to transform elements from other localities (that constitute their contexts) and to accomodate them into their own locality (their plans). This is, I argue, essentially what design is. However, as designing always implies a selection based on a certain perspective, it also implies designating other options (other perspectives) less valid, incompatible, marginal, anomalous and finally even as redundant or superflous. Small and mountain farmers have frequently been categorised in this way as have others with know-how acquired in other ways than through science.I discuss the concept of redundancy and emphasize that there is a challenge associated with seeing anomalies as opportunities. Such an attitude goes beyond the modernization perspective and makes the best of diversity, a diversity that explicitly refers to the capacity possessed by every actor to design his or her projects, or life. I maintain that this capacity has been considered redundant for too long, and argue that the design capacity for rural and agricultural development could be greatly enlarged if the design capacity of individuals and of institutions would be interlocked. Empirical and descriptive approaches have also long been stigmatised redundant by scientific praxis, to that extent that theory sometimes substitutes reality. Theory (plans, models) should continue to learn from and draw from the reality (context) in order to establish new and innovative scientific endeavour (performances). Sociological analysis is not enough to enrich our day to day activities. The past receives ample attention, but the future remains largely unconsidered and even the present seems hard to catch up with. On the other hand, economic and agronomic models designed to forecast and direct future developments, are usually based on lines of actions taken in the past. They are unable to accomodate changes that might occurr in the present and future and have serious problems to reflect on their own performances. Both sociology, economy and agronomy need to be complemented by a synthetic scientific approach, an approach that constructs new coherence by continously going back and forth between theory and practice (action).These considerations lead me to conclude the book with a proposal for a sociology of design.Alternate abstract:Este libro trata del desarrollo de la Sierra de la Contraviesa en el Sur de España. Esta Sierra, con cumbres hasta 1.500 metros, está bordeada por el mar mediteráneo, y constituye la llamada parte baja de la Alpujarra en el sur de la provincia de Granada en la Comunidad de Andalucía. Es una zona marginada, llamada así entre otros por una emigración de la población joven, una falta de servicios, su aislamiento y por las condiciones naturales (pendientes fuertes, suelos pobres, una precipitación anual de unos 350-600 litros con una tendencia a la baja), que aparentemente inhiben un desarrollo próspero de la actividad económica principal, que es el cultivo en secano de frutales como la vid, el almendro y la higuera. Sin embargo, el desafío que me planteo en este libro es buscar alternativas de desarrollo que se sustentan en los recursos locales, incluidos los agrarios.     El libro puede leerse a trozos sueltos según los distintos intereses teóricos, empíricos u otros; sin embargo, su foco integrador sólo se percibe si se leen los capítulos en el orden marcado. Este foco concierne la ampliación de nuestra capacidad de diseño de cara al desarrollo rural y agrario. Atención especial reciben los procesos de desarrollo, las personas, regiones y actividades que no son vistos, que no son valorados y que por tanto son marginados. Se argumenta que éstos, sin embargo, son cruciales para poder concebir alternativas de desarrollo. En este libro, lo no-visto es tratado de la siguiente forma:     1 teóricamente (globalización, localización, diversidad: capítulos 1 y 7)     2 empíricamente (estadísticas, manejo de los recursos naturales, estulos agrarios, intervenciones de desarrollo, acción colectiva local; capítulos 2-6)     3 exploradora (capacidad de diseño, experimentación, redundancia, análisis versus síntesis; capítulo 7)     De teoría: globalización, localización, diversidad     El capítulo 1 empieza con una discusión teórica sobre la naturaleza de los procesos de globalización y localización. La globalización no es entendida como un fenómeno estructural que determina la suerte de las localidades; al contrario, la globalización, tanto como la localización, son considerados procesos de definición de las reglas de interacción entre localidades. Hablo de localización (que para mí es equivalente al desarrollo endógeno) cuando una localidad no-dominante ('lo local') es capaz de ejercer una influencia decisiva sobre una localidad dominante (una globalidad, 'lo global') con respecto al tema en cuestión. Para investigar esto, se arguye que se requiere una aproximación tipo actor, y es la que sigo en este libro.     A continuación discuto la necesidad de re-examinar la actividad agraria en las zonas marginadas, de la cual comúnmente se dice que no contiene potencial de desarrollo alguno, y más así si se la considera desde un punto de vista estructuralista sobre el complejo agroalimentario, según el cual los mercados internacionales y el Estado condicionan en gran medida el desarrollo agrario local. Centro la discusión en la heterogeneidad de la actividad agraria, enfatizando la forma particular en la cual los agricultores organizan su proceso de trabajo en relación a los mercados, su tierra y la Administración. Estas formas de organización se llaman estilos agrarios, y se refieren a los distintos juegos de nociones, culturalmente compartidas éstas, sobre cómo ha de efectuarse la actividad agraria. El conocimiento local sobre el manejo de los recursos naturales es parte de estas nociones. El concepto de estilos agrarios pretende entender y explicar el establecimiento de la coherencia en la actividad agraria. Esto no es tarea fácil, y es probablemente la razón por la cual personas relativamente ajenas a la actividad - como agrónomos, sociólogos, políticos - muchas veces confunden la actuación ('performance') en campo con un plan de cultivo (cf Richards, 1995).     Después emprendo una búsqueda para formular un modelo teórico que explica la generación de diversidad (que manejo como equivalente de heterogeneidad), que, en mi opinión, no se ha entendido propiamente hasta la fecha. Se introducen las nociones de plan, actuación y contexto como características centrales de este modelo, las cuales son entrelazadas con las nociones centrales de la teoría de estructuración de Giddens, en la cual las llamadas consecuencias no-intencionadas de acción intencionada juegan un papel vital. Planes de actores botan y rebotan con sus contextos específicos y se cristalizan temporalmente en actuaciones, las cuales a su turno modifican los planes y contextos; de esta forma, los actores tejen hilos de planes, contextos y actuaciones que en ciertos momentos pueden entrecruzarse con los hilos de otros actores. En tales ocasiones, sus proyectos se encajan y se generan actuaciones conjuntas.     En la transformación de un plan a una actuación, los actores deben de echar mano no sólo de su knowledgeability y su capability1, sino también de su creatividad, la cual se introduce como una tercera propiedad formal que posee todo actor. Por tanto, por creatividad se entiende la capacidad de percibir la relevancia de ciertas cosas del contexto con respecto al plan de uno. Las condiciones no-reconocidas de acción intencionada garantizan la generación de diversidad; la capacidad creativa de cada actor garantiza la creación de diversidad. Sin embargo, aunque mucho han sido estudiados los procesos creativos de aclamados genios, poco se sabe acerca de las creaciones y descubrimentos de la gente común, como agricultores, y es a ésto que el concepto de estilos agrarios pretende contribuir. Los descubrimentos implican cuestiones de autoría y de procesos de autorización (cf. Schaffer, 1994); es por esto que la interacción social está a la base en la creación y generación de diversidad, no sólo la diversidad en la actividad agraria, sino también de perspectivas de desarrollo alternativas, y de entendimientos científicos de éstas mismas. Lo anterior tiene importantes consecuencias para la metodología utilizada. He optado en este estudio por la observación participativa y las entrevistas semi-estructuradas, junto a estudios de casos extensos. Y esto nos lleva a la parte empírica.     El material empírico: las estadísticas, el manejo de los recursos naturales, los estilos agrarios, intervenciones de desarrollo, acción colectiva local     La parte empírica empieza por reagrupar datos estadísticos publicados sobre demografía, empleo, la dependencia económica exterior y la tenencia de la tierra (capítulo 2). Resaltaremos aquí dos conclusiones importantes. Por un lado, la Contraviesa, como una zona marginada, sobrevive gracias a subvenciones externas en una medida muy inferior a lo que comúnmente se piensa. Es al contrario: son precisamente las zonas con más abundantes recursos agrícolas (como por ejemplo en la provincia de Sevilla) que dependen de financiación externa (en 1992, esta financiación comprendía el 37,5 por cien de la renta agraria total; en la Contraviesa ascendía a menos del 5,5 por cien). La segunda conclusión es que la emigración masiva que ha ocurrido en la Contraviesa desde 1950 no ha desembocado en una apatía, sino en un dinamismo agrario abundante, especialmente hasta la década de los años 80. Es esta una tendencia contraria a lo que se observa a nivel nacional.     Se profundiza en este dinamismo en el capítulo 3, que documenta la evolución del manejo de los recursos naturales en el último siglo. Se utilizan básicamente datos primarios, recabados con un enfoque etnoecológico. Aquí resaltaremos tres puntos. En primer lugar tratamos del intercambio del material genético entre los agricultores. En ello, proceden de forma muy selectiva: van a un determinado lugar, para tratar con determinadas personas, para obtener una semilla determinada. Esto nos empuja a hipotetizar la existencia de una red relativamente densa de lugares donde se produce semilla de una calidad específica, y a través de la cual se transporta la semilla de un lugar a otro. Se bautizan a estos lugares paradas de cultivo; en analogía a las paradas de autobuses, son sitios donde la semilla 'sube' y 'baja'; es donde la semilla 'para' por un momento y es cultivada e imbricada en las prácticas agrícolas específicas locales. Las paradas de cultivo funcionan como cámaras de clima en el sentido de que cuando una semilla llega a una nueva parada de cultivo, puede adaptarse fenotípicamente a las condiciones nuevas; eventualmente, el contexto nuevo puede incluso conducirle a desarrollar nuevas calidades genéticas, y en este sentido una parada de cultivo también es una sala departo. El marco teórico desarrollado en el capítulo 1 entorno a la generación de diversidad parece ser aplicable también en este contexto de las ciencias naturales; tratamos con actuaciones fenotípicas, planes genéticos y contextos cambiantes.     El otro punto caliente en el capítulo 3 concierne la moruna {Vicia articulata Hornem.), una leguminosa utilizada localmente como abono verde y como forraje animal. Esta Vicia no está documentada apenas en la literatura agronómica, a pesar de su potencial de cara al diseño de sistemas agroecológicos sustentables. Sin embargo, este potencial sí ha sido aprovechado desde hace tiempo por los horticultores en la Alpujarra Alta, donde la semilla de moruna de la Contraviesa es utilizada para mejorar la fertilidad del suelo en las rotaciones hortícolas de riego. Esta dependencia orgánica es doble: agricultores de la Contraviesa van en búsqueda de la cebada de personas determinadas en la Alpujarra Alta. Finalmente, el capítulo 3 avanza un concepto popular para contrarestar los procesos de erosión que actualmente acontecen en la Contraviesa, llamado la reforestación melgar. Una melga o merga es una antigua palabra imbricada en el discurso campesino, y en la Contraviesa se refiere a los pequeños trozos de tierra que son de menor importancia para el agricultor. En vez de combatir la desertificación que en la actualidad amenza el sureste español a través del fomento de plantaciones de árboles de una superficie mínima, como la Administración andaluza está haciendo, una reforestación melgar propone reforestar trozos (muy) pequeños de tierra. Se argumenta que ésto le permite a un agricultor integrar mejor sus intereses econónomicos con los ecológicos; probablemente también es de interés desde un punto de vista de la teoría de metapoblaciones.     El capítulo 4 trata extensamente del desarrollo de los distintos estilos agarios, un desarrollo que está vinculado al dinamismo agrario anteriormente referido, que permitió a la gente responder a las distintas crisis sacando provecho de su repertorio cultural local. La emigración masiva no sólo condujo a la despolarización social de la Contraviesa (se fueron tanto los ricos como los pobres), sino también posibilitó la emancipación de los estratos socio-económicos medianos y bajos. Estos ahora intentaron realizar el sueño de ser un labrador. Este término se refiere al estilo agrario regional que ha servido como el marco de referencia para el desarrollo de la finca a lo largo de los años. Aspectos claves incluyen: construir una finca de una dimensión lo suficientemente grande como para resultar fincas viables para los hijos después de repartirse la finca entre ellos (la finca de herencia); generar la mayor diversidad de productos posibles (vino, almendras, higos, cereales, leguminosas, ganado de varias clases, hortalizas, olivos...) para ser autosuficiente en lo máximo; esta autosuficiencia también incluye un deseo por una autonomía respecto a mercados y el Estado.     Gradualmente, dos estilos agrarios desarrollaron desde el estilo regional de labrador. Uno es el labrador de anchura, que enfatiza la diversificación de los riesgos y la reducción de loS costes laborales, a costa de una calidad y cantidad constantes de los productos. El otro es el labrador de constancia, que enfatiza el realizar las faenas de campo en el momento justo para obtener una calidad y cantidad de productos constantes, aunque a expensas de considerables costes laborales incluso en años en que se anticipa una mala cosecha. Muchas veces, la migración temporal ha jugado un papel importante en la construcción de las fincas de los labradores. Sin embargo, no todas las familias han sido capaces de realizar el sueño del labrador; algunos seguían dependiendo de ingresos externos. Unos ganan dinero alquilándose como muleros para labrar la tierra de sus colegas; otros tienen trabajos adicionales no-agrícolas (los llamados migrantes). A mitad de los años 80, el proyecto de desarrollo agrario del labrador se invalida de forma creciente por el cambio en el valor relativo del trabajo y la tierra. Otras vías han de encontrarse; hasta inicios de los 90 éstas se caracterizaban por una especialización en vitivinicultura; por el cultivo ecológico y por la mecanización. Estos elementos han sido combinados hasta culminarse en nuevas perspectivas agrarias, en un intento de valorar máximamente los recursos locales. Típicamente, y contrario al proyecto de labrador, la dimensión de finca preferida es aquella que puede ser abordada fundamentalmente por el trabajo familiar (entre 10 y 25 ha, en función del estilo agrario). Esta tendencia, apoyada también por el estudio del caso del fracaso económico reciente de una las últimas fincas muy grandes, es contraria a creencias que la actividad agraria en zonas marginadas sólo es viable cuando se multiplica la dimensión de la finca en lo posible. Gradualmente se están perfilando nuevos estilos agrarios que buscan una nueva coherencia entre la tierra, el trabajo, la tecnología, los mercados y el Estado. Esto ciertamente no es nada fácil; muchas familias están indecisas sobre qué hacer. El capítulo concluye con una comparación entre las actuaciones económicas de los distintos estilos a nivel familiar y regional.     En el capítulo 5, considero más detenidamente las iniciativas locales recientes para transcender la autonomía familiar tipo labrador, para defender y mejorar las condiciones socio-económicas en la Contraviesa de forma colectiva. Se realizan estudios de casos de una Asociación de Vecinos, la Asociación de Cosecheros y una cooperativa de vino ecológico. Estos estudios demuestran el papel crucial que juegan los intermediarios; individuos que son capaces de articular lo local con lo global y viceversa, y de traducir, adaptar y sintonizar, siempre y cuando sea posible, las prescripciones globales a las realidades locales.     La falta de intermediarios calificados es lo que actualmente aflige a las intervenciones de desarrollo (semi-) públicas, de las cuales se estudian dos en el capítulo 5. Una concierne al Plan de Mejora del Almendro, un programa subvencionado por la Unión Europea y el Estado español a través de una red nacional de cooperativas. En teoría pretende incrementar la productividad de los almendros, pero en la práctica es poco más que una fuente de ingresos adicional para las familias agrarias. El Plan es prescriptivo en el empleo de insumos químicos, e ignora y destruye el potencial local para el cultivo ecológico de los almendros, por ejemplo a través del uso del abono verde, la moruna, anteriormente refererida.     La otra interveción es el Programa LEADER. Este proyecto, subvencionado por la Unión Europea, es mucho más diverso en su funcionamiento, y es un intento serio para localizar el desarrollo. Sin embargo, en la Alpujarra tiene un sesgo turístico tremendo, en detrimento del apoyo para la agricultura. Así, no logra reconocer su importancia para la reproducción del paisaje, que constituye el mayor atractivo turístico de la zona. Aunque el LEADER de la Alpujarra funciona como un verdadero intermediario entre distintos cuerpos administrativos y los habitantes locales, muestra poca capacidad para fortalecer un desarrollo que se origina a partir de las estrategias locales y menos de las agrarias. En vez de apoyar y construir la pluriactividad a nivel familiar, su poca afinidad con la agricultura provoca una pluriactividad a nivel regional, es decir, unas áreas turísticas y otras agrícolas sin apenas lazos económicos. A ello ciertamente ha contibuido también el énfasis sobre procedimientos formales y burocráticos, que no son capaces de reconocer y tratar las estrategias de desarrollo locales y otros recursos locales con potencial para el desarrollo. Sin duda, es éste uno de los problemas claves de cara a la localización del desarrollo rural.     En el capítulo 6 se elabora este problema clave y es por tanto un capítulo pivotal en el libro. En dos estudios de casos se documenta la enorme perseverania que necesitan las familias agrarias para superar las numerosas restricciones administrativas, fiscales y sanitarias que limitan sus posibilidades para solicitar apoyo financiero, en resumen, para desarrollar sus actividades. Se requieren verdaderamente, y según un dicho local, cojones y maestría. Uno de los casos trata de una quesería. La fuerza de esta quesería es precisamente la integración del mantenimiento de ganado lechero (ovino y caprino), con la transformación de la leche en queso y su venta directa y local. Sin embargo, requisitos burocráticos segmentan estas actividades como si fuera una industria, lo cual conduce, por un lado, a costes adicionales que debilitan la fuerza competitiva de esta empresa, y por otro lado, a una pérdida de potencial de desarrollo local. Esto significa que paradójicamente es más fácil para esta quesería producir un queso estándar y 'universal' tipo Gouda, que un queso fresco, local y tradicional pero no-documentado.     El otro estudio versa sobre la evolución y el funcionamiento del sector vitivinícola, dando un énfasis especial en los distintos canales de venta y las dificultades para establecer un aval que defienda el origen del vino local frente al vino importado. Es este un tema conflictivo en la Contraviesa; los vitivinicultores mantienen diferentes posturas respecto a lo que desde mitad de los años 80 se ha llegado a llamar el 'fraude del vino'.     El capítulo 6 evidencia el pluralismo técnico y legal existente en la Contraviesa en la descripción de la naturaleza del conflicto entre lo local y lo global, lo particular y lo universal, entre las 'vías estatales' (state ways) y las 'vías populares' (folk ways; cf. Pitt- Rivers, 1961). Este pluralismo ha posibilitado y al mismo tiempo se constituye por lo que llamo los movimientos de soslayo. Los movimientos de soslayo son conductas socialmente e históricamente construidas empleadas estratégicamente para esconderse y protegerse de lo que es percibido como algo negativo para la situación de uno, y para emerger y re-aparecer cuando 'cuando ya no hay moros en la costa'. Por ejemplo, los agricultores demandan un apoyo financiero y protección para el sector vitivinícola, pero cuando se realiza un Catastro de los viñedos que facilita la consideración de una 'Denominación de Origen', varios son renuentes a cooperar porque temen unas consecuencias fiscales. El programa LEADER de la Alpujarra demanda una mayor participación ciudadana, pero organiza la formulación de los planes de tal forma que ideas y potencial locales apenas pueden aflorar. La invisibilidad es entonces utilizada como un recurso estratégico. Al mismo tiempo, ambas partes intentan intensivamente mobilizar precisamente aquellos recursos que la otra parte prefiere esconder, porque conciernen activos estratégicos (como dinero público y ahorros locales). Se sugiere que tales movimientos pueden entenderse, y en referencia a Scott (1985), como formas cotidianas de resistencia campesina y Administativa. Sin embargo, y con respecto a los agricultores, estos movimientos pueden funcionar a nivel de la familia (claramente vinculados al deseo por mantener la autonomía tipo labrador), pero es al menos dudoso si esta capacidad atomizada de influir en el cauce de las cosas (este agency) pueda ser efectiva en el futuro. El clamor por nuevas formas de cooperación es evidente, pero éstas no se establecen con facilidad, como se mostró en el capítulo 5. Estas no tienen por qué necesariamente acoplarse a un modelo de organización colectiva formal (que poseen autoridad formal), sino que probablemente podrían fortalecerse a través de una red mucho más densa de intermediarios a nivel de campo que son capaces de traducir las prescripciones globales a las realidades locales y viceversa. Por tanto, alego que existe una necesidad por una autoridad situada, es decir, una autoridad ostentada por actores que poseen los conocimientos (knowledgeability), la capacidad (capability) y la creatividad para operar en el contexto global tanto como el local. Se sugiere que éste sea el camino más importante en el cual el Programa LEADER podría desenvolverse.     La exploración: capacidad de diseño, experimentación, redundancia, análisis ver sus síntesis     Impresionado por la capacidad de los habitantes de la Contraviesa para sobrevivir, proseguir sus actividades e incluso para innovar, en el capítulo 7 reflexiono sobre los aspectos de construcción y composición de la vida cotidiana. Exploro varios itinerarios.     Empiezo por reconsiderar el dicho local 'hacer una cosa con cojones y maestría'; hago lo mismo con las nociones de plan y actuación desarrolladas en el capítulo 1. Esto me lleva considerar la analogía entre una actuación agrícola y una actuación de jazz; a este efecto, realzo cinco aspectos que comparten ambas actividades - ritmo, melodía, habilidades técnicas, amor y el 'sentido de forma'. Poseer una maestría en estos aspectos posibilita a un músico de jazz y a un agricultor a improvisar, es decir, explorar caminos y experimentar cosas que no son fácilmente reconocidos ni apreciados por personas ajenas a la actividad, como científicos (incluyendo musicólogos y agrónomos). La noción musical de 'sentido de forma' tiene su equivalente en el concepto de 'estilos agrarios', y nos lleva a reconsiderar la importancia de la orientación a un objetivo (el 'goal-orientedness') de la actividad humana. Sin embargo, el poder de diseño que emana de una claridad de objetivos puede debilitarse por una falta de una capacidad de aprendizaje, lo cual, a su vez, imposibilita la refijación y sintonización a tiempo de los objetivos. Discuto la noción griega sobre 'hacer una tarea de forma sistimatiká', tal como aceituneros cretenses lo entienden, y en la cual el amor y una disposición para aprender son cruciales. Estos son aspectos que generalmente no se toman en cuenta en la mayoría de las llamadas 'aproximaciones de sistemas' en el desarrollo agrario y rural. Arguyo que el aprender tiene mucho que ver con la capacidad de un actor para reconocer algo de su contexto como relevante para su plan; es la habilidad para ver coherencia que posibilita la creación de coherencia. En otras palabras, descansa en la creatividad de actores para apropiar, desconstruir y transformar elementos de otras localidades (que constituyen sus contextos) y acomodarlos en su propia localidad (sus planes). Esencialmente es esto lo que es diseñar. No obstante, ya que la actividad de diseñar siempre implica una selección basada en una cierta perspectiva, también implica que otras opciones (otras perspectivas) deben considerarse como menos válidas, rivalizadoras, marginales, anómalas y finalmente incluso como redundantes y supérfluas. Este ha sido el caso de los campesinos de montaña y otros agricultores pequeños, y en general de todo conocimiento adquirido por otras vías que la científica.     Discuto el concepto de redundancia y argumento que existe un desafío grande para concebir las anomalías como oportunidades; este tipo de actitud probablemente es capaz de ir más allá del pensamiento de la modernización y aprovechar al máximo la diversidad. Esta diversidad explícitamente se refiere a la capacidad ostentada por cada actor para diseñar su propio proyecto, su propia vida. Sostengo que durante demasiado tiempo esta capacidad se ha considerado como redundante, y arguyo que la capacidad de diseño de cara al desarrollo agrario y rural podría enriquecerse mucho si se partiera del encaje de las capacidades de diseño individuales y las de organizaciones formales. También las aproximaciones empíricas y descriptivas han llegado a ser consideradas redundantes para la praxis científica, incluso hasta tal punto que a veces la teoría sustituye a la realidad. La teoría (planes, modelos) debería de seguir aprendiendo e inspirándose de la realidad (el contexto), para establecer nuevos e innovadores quehaceres científicos (actuaciones). El análisis sociológico generalmente no es suficiente para enriquecer nuestras actividades cotidianas; dice mucho sobre el pasado pero poco sobre el futuro, y muchas veces ni siquiera alcanza estar al tanto del presente. Por otra parte, modelos económicos y agronómicos para predecir y guiar el futuro generalmente se basan en una selección de caminos de desarrollo conocidos del pasado, y son incapaces de acomodar cambios que pueden ocurrir en el presente y el futuro. Tanto la sociología como la economía y la agronomía deberían de complementarse por una aproximación científica sintética, que es una aproximación que construye nueva coherencia a través de una continua reflexión entre la teoría y la práctica (la acción).     El libro concluye con una propuesta para una sociología de diseño.Alternate abstract:Dit boek gaat over de ontwikkeling van de Siërra de la Contraviesa in Zuid-Spanje. Dit berggebied met pieken tot 1.500 meter grenst aan de Middellandse Zee, en is het lagere gedeelte van de Alpujarra regio in de provincie Granada (Andalusië). Het is een gebied dat gewoonlijk 'gemarginaliseerd' wordt genoemd, vanwege o.a. de ontvolking, waardoor het gebied vergrijsd is, een gebrek aan diensten, een geïsoleerde ligging en een natuurlijke gesteldheid (steile hellingen, arme bodems, een jaarlijkse neerslag van 350-600 mm met een dalende tendens), die ogenschijnlijk een voorspoedige ontwikkeling van de belangrijkste economische activiteit die er van oudsher bedreven wordt, bemoeilijkt. Dit is de regenafhankelijke teelt van meerjarige gewassen zoals wijndruiven, amandelen en vijgen. De uitdaging die ik in dit boek aanga is een zoektocht naar alternatieven voor de ontwikkeling van de Siërra de la Contraviesa die stoelen op het gebruik van lokale hulpbronnen, met inbegrip van de landbouw.     Hoewel het mogelijk is het boek al grasduinend te lezen naar gelang theoretische, empirische of andere interesses, heeft het een duidelijk brandpunt, dat alleen zichtbaar wordt wanneer de hoofdstukken worden gelezen in de volgorde waarin ze zijn geplaatst. Dit brandpunt betreft de vergroting van de ontwerpcapaciteit ten aanzien van rurale en agrarische ontwikkeling. Met name worden die ontwikkelingsprocessen, mensen, gebieden en activiteiten onder de loep genomen die ongezien, niet gewaardeerd en daardoor gemarginaliseerd zijn of worden. Ik beweer dat deze essentieel zijn om alternatieven voor ontwikkeling te kunnen concipiëren. In dit boek wordt 'het ongeziene' op de volgende wijze behandeld:     1 theoretisch (globalisering, lokalisering, diversiteit; hoofdstukken 1 en 7)     2 empirisch (statistieken, het beheer van de natuurlijke hulpbronnen, bedrijfsstijlen, ontwikkelingsinterventies, lokale collectieve actie; hoofdstukken 2-6)     3 exploratie/ (ontwerpcapaciteit, creativiteit, experimenten, redundantie, analyse versus synthese: hoofdstuk 7)     Over theorie: globalisering, lokalisering, diversiteit     Hoofdstuk 1 begint met een theoretische discussie over de aard van de globaliseringsen lokaliseringsprocessen. Globalisering wordt niet begrepen als een structureel fenomeen dat het lot van lokaliteiten bepaalt; integendeel, globalisering, en lokalisering, worden beide gezien als processen waarin de interactieregels tussen lokaliteiten worden gedefinieerd. Ik spreek derhalve over lokalisering (dat ik gelijk stel aan endogene ontwikkeling) wanneer een niet-dominante lokaliteit ('het lokale') in staat is om een beslissende invloed uit te oefenen op een dominante lokaliteit (een globaliteit, 'het globale') met betrekking tot het thema in kwestie. Om dit te onderzoeken acht ik een zogenoemde actor-oriented nodig, die ik dan ook volg in dit boek.     Vervolgens bediscussieer ik de noodzaak om de landbouwactiviteit in gemarginaliseerde gebieden te heroverwegen. Die staat gewoonlijk te boek als zonder ontwikkelingspotentieel, met name wanneer vanuit een structuralistisch standpunt naar het agro-food complex gekeken wordt, volgens welke de internationale markten en de overheid de lokale landbouwontwikkeling bepalen. Ik richt de discussie op de heterogeniteit van de landbouwbeoefening, en benadruk de wijze waarop boeren hun arbeidsproces organiseren in verhouding tot markten, hun land en de overheid. Deze organisatie wijzen worden bedrijfsstijlen genoemd, en verwijzen naar verschillende gehelen van cultureel gedragen noties over 'hoe geboerd dient te worden'. Lokale kennis over het beheer van de natuurlijke hulpbronnen maakt deel uit van deze noties. Het bedrijfsstijlenconcept pretendeert het bewerkstelligen van coherentie in de landbouwactiviteit te begrijpen en verklaren. Dit is geen eenvoudige zaak, en is waarschijnlijk ook de reden waarom relatieve buitenstaanders - landbouwkundigen, sociologen, beleidsmakers - vaak een Izndbouw-performance2 verwarren met een landbouwbedrijfs-p/*m (cf. Richards, 1995).     Daarna onderneem een zoektocht om een theoretisch model te formuleren dat generatie van diversiteit (dat ik gebruik als synoniem voor heterogeniteit) begrijpt, iets wat naar mijn mening tot nog toe onvoldoende wordt gedaan. De noties plan, performance en context worden naar voren geschoven als hoekstenen van dit model, en worden vervlochten met centrale noties uit de structuratietheorie van Giddens, waarin de onbedoelde gevolgen van bedoelde actie een vitale rol spelen. Plannen van actoren reflecteren met hun specifieke contexten en kristalliseren vervolgens in tijdelijke performances, die op hun beurt weer de plannen en contexten beïnvloeden. Op deze wijze weven actoren draden van plannen, contexten en performances, die op sommige momenten de draden van andere actoren kunnen snijden; in zo'n geval klikken hun projecten ineen en genereren ze een gezamenlijke performance.     In de transformatie van een plan tot een performance moeten actoren niet alleen voortbouwen op hun knowledgeability en capability, maar ook op hun creativiteit, dat naar voren wordt geschoven als een derde formele eigenschap van actoren. Creativiteit wordt dan ook begrepen als het vermogen om de relevantie van aspecten van de context voor het eigen plan te onderkennen. De niet-onderkende voorwaarden van bedoelde actie garanderen de generatie van diversiteit, en het creatief vermogen van actoren garandeert de creatie van diversiteit. Echter, hoewel de creatieve processen van gevierde genieën vaak bestudeerd zijn, is slechts weinig bekend van de dagelijkse creaties en ontdekkingen van het gewone volk, waaronder ook boeren, en dat is precies waar het bedrijfsstijlenconcept aan toe bij probeert te dragen. Een ontdekking impliceert zowel auteursschap als een autorisatieproces (cf. Schaffer, 1994); dit is waarom sociale interactie aan de bron van de creatie en generatie van diversiteit staat, niet alleen de diversiteit in de landbouwbeoefening, maar ook in alternatieve perspectieven op ontwikkeling, en in het wetenschappelijk begrip van deze laatsten. Dit alles heeft tenslotte belangrijke gevolgen voor de gebruikte methodologie; in deze studie heb ik gekozen voor participatieve observatie en semi-gestructureerde interviews, tezamen met uitgebreide case studies. En dit leidt ons naar het empirische gedeelte.     Het empirisch materiaal: statistieken, het beheer van de natuurlijke hulpbronnen, bedrijfsstijlen, ontwikkelingsinterventies, lokale collectieve actie     Het empirische gedeelte begint met een hergroepering van gepubliceerd statitisch materiaal over demografie, werk, externe economische afhankelijkheid en de landbezitsverhoudingen (hoofdstuk 2). Twee hoofdconclusies kunnen hieruit worden getrokken. Aan de ene kant overleeft een gemarginaliseerde gebied als de Contraviesa - veel minder dan gewoonlijk wordt aangenomen - op basis van externe subsidies; integendeel, het zijn juist de gebieden die veel rijker zijn bedacht met natuurlijke hulpbronnen, zoals in de provincie van Sevilla, die steunen op externe financiering. In 1992 had deze financiering een omvang van 37,5 procent van het totale landbouwinkomen, tegenover minder dan 5,5 procent in de Contraviesa. De tweede conclusie is dat de massale emigratie die in de Contraviesa plaats heeft gevonden sinds 1950, niet heeft geresulteerd in een apathie, maar juist in een uitbundige landboudynamiek, met name tot het begin van de jaren tachtig. Dit is een tendens die tegengesteld is aan wat op nationaal niveau wordt waargenomen.     Deze dynamiek wordt verder uitgewerkt in hoofdstuk 3, dat de evolutie van het beheer van de natuurlijke hulpbronnen beschrijft in de laatste eeuw. Deze beschrijving stoelt voornamelijk op primaire data die verzameld zijn vanuit een ethno-ecologisch perspectief. In deze samenvatting belicht ik drie punten. Ten eerste wordt het belang van de uitwisseling van genetisch materiaal tussen boeren benadrukt. Dit doen boeren op zeer selectieve wijze; zij gaan naar een bepaalde plaats, naar bepaalde mensen om bepaald zaad te krijgen. Dit veronderstelt het bestaan van een relatief dicht netwerk van plaatsen waar zaad van specifieke kwaliteit wordt geproduceerd, en waarin zaad wordt getransporteerd van de ene plek naar de andere. Deze plekken worden teelthalten genoemd; analoog aan bushalten zijn het plekken waar zaad 'instapt' en 'uitstapt'; het is waar het zaad tijdelijk 'stopt' en geteeld wordt, ingebed in de specifieke, en voor die plek geldende, landbouwpraktijken. Teelthalten functioneren als klimaatkamers in die zin dat zaad dat aankomt bij een nieuwe teelthalte zich fenotypisch kan aanpassen aan de nieuwe condities; uiteindelijk kan de nieuwe context zelfs leiden tot de ontwikkeling van nieuwe genetische kwaliteiten van het zaad, en in die zin is een teelthalte ook een kraamkamer. Het theoretisch kader ontwikkeld in hoofdstuk 1 omtrent de generatie van diversiteit blijkt ook in dit natuurwetenschappelijke verband bruikbaar te zijn: we hebben te maken met fenotypische performances, een genetisch plan en een wisselende context.     Het andere hete hangijzer uit hoofdstuk 3 betreft de moruna (Vicia articulata Hornem.), een wikke die lokaal gebruikt wordt als groenbemester en als ruwvoer voor dieren. Deze vlinderbloemige is nauwelijks beschreven in de agronomische literatuur, ondanks haar potentieel voor de ontwikkeling van duurzame landbouwsystemen. Niettemin is haar potentieel wél sinds lang onderkend door de boeren uit de zogenoemde Hoge Alpujarra, waar zaad uit de Contraviesa wordt gebruikt om de vruchtbaarheid van de bodems in de bevloeide groententeelt op peil te houden. Deze organische afhankelijkheid is tweezijdig: boeren uit de Contraviesa komen voor gerstzaad naar bepaalde mensen uit de Hoge Alpujarra.     Tenslotte komt in hoofdstuk 3 een boerenconcept aan de orde om de erosieprocessen, waar de Contraviesa momenteel mee te kampen heeft, tegen te gaan: de melgar herbebossing genoemd. Melga of merga is een oud spaans woord dat is ingebed in het boerendiscours, en verwijst in de Contraviesa naar kleine stukjes land die van minder belang zijn voor de boer. In plaats van de verwoestijning, die in grote delen van zuidoost Spanje actueel is, te bestrijden door het stimuleren van boomplantages van een minimum afmeting, zoals nu wordt gedaan door de Andalusische overheid, stelt een melgar herbebossing voor om juist (hele) kleine stukjes land te bebossen. Hierdoor, zo wordt gesteld, kan een boer veel beter zijn economische en ecologische belangen tegen elkaar afwegen; het voorstel is waarschijnlijk ook van belang vanuit een metapopulatie-theoretisch perspectief.     Hoofdstuk 4 gaat uitgebreid in op de ontwikkeling van verschillende bedrijfsstijlen en bouwt voort op de eerder genoemde landbouwdynamiek die mensen in staat stelde om vanuit het lokaal cultureel repertoire te antwoorden op de successieve crisissen. De massale emigratie leidde niet alleen tot een sociale depolarisering van de Contraviesa (zowel de rijken als de armen trokken weg), maar maakte ook de emancipatie mogelijk van de midden en lagere sociaal-economische lagen. Deze zagen nu de kans schoon om hun ideaal te verwezenlijken: een labrador te worden. Deze term verwijst naar een regionale landbouwstijl die als een referentiekader fungeerde voor de bedrijfsontwikkeling door de jaren heen. Sleutelaspecten zijn: het streven naar een bedrijf dat zó groot is dat ook de kinderen nog een levensvatbaar bedrijf overhouden, zelfs na verdeling van het bedrijf door een erfenis; een zo groot mogelijke variëteit aan producten (wijn, amandelen, vijgen, granen, leguminosen, verschillende soorten vee, groenten, olijven...) om zo veel mogelijk in de eigen behoeften te kunnen voorzien; deze self sufficiency houdt ook een streven in naar een groot mogelijke autonomie met betrekking tot markten en overheid. Geleidelijk hebben zich twee bedrijfsstijlen ontwikkeld uit de regionale labrador-stijl. Eén is de zogenoemde ancbura labrador, die de nadruk legt op risicospreiding en het minimaliseren van de arbeidskosten, wat echter ten koste gaat van een constante productkwantiteit en -kwaliteit. De andere is constancia labrador, die de nadruk legt op het uitvoeren van het werk op het juiste moment om een zo constant mogelijke kwantien kwaliteit te krijgen, wat echter gepaard gaat met aanzienlijke arbeidskosten , zelfs in jaren wanneer de oogstvooruitzichten slecht zijn. Tijdelijke migratie heeft vaak een belangrijke rol gespeeld in het opbouwen van de /a^rWor-bedrijven. Niettemin zijn niet alle boerenfamilies erin geslaagd om hun ideaal te verwezenlijken; een aantal bleef afhankelijke van externe inkomsten. Zij verdienen hun geld hetzij door zich te verhuren om het land van anderen te ploegen met hun eigen muilezels (de muleros), danwel door andere aanvullende inkomsten buiten de landbouw (de zogeheten migrantes).     In het midden van de jaren, tachtig verbrokkelde het labrador-ideaal steeds meer door een toenemende omkering van de relatieve waarden land en arbeid; andere wegen moesten worden ingeslagen. Tot aan het begin van de jaren negentig werden deze wegen gemarkeerd door een specialisatie in de wijnteelt, door ecologische bedrijfsvoering en door mechanisatie. Deze elementen werden herschikt in nieuwe landbouwperspectieven, waarin men het beste probeerde te maken van de lokale hulpbronnen. In tegenstelling tot wat in het labrador-project gebruikelijk is, is de streefgrootte van een bedrijf momenteel die dimensie die nog met voornamelijk met familiearbeid bewerkt kan worden (afhankelijk van bedrijsfsstijl, 10-25 ha). Deze tendens, die ook wordt onderschreven door een case study van het recente failliet van een van de laatste zeer grote bedrijven, is tegengesteld aan de opvatting dat in gemarginaliseerde gebieden landbouwactiviteit louter levensvatbaar is bij een grote uitbreiding van de bedrijfsdimensie. Geleidelijk ontstaan nieuwe bedrijfsstijlen die proberen een nieuwe brug te slaan tussen land, arbeid, technologie, de markten en de overheid. Het moge duidelijk zijn dat dit allesbehalve gemakkelijk is; een groot aantal boerenfamilies is onzeker over de te nemen stappen. Het hoofdstuk besluit met een vergelijking van de economische bedrijfsresultaten van de verschillende stijlen op huishoud- en regionaal niveau.     In hoofdstuk 5 neem ik de lokale initiatieven onder de loep die proberen de labrador-autonomie te overstijgen, teneinde de sociaal-economische situatie in de Contraviesa te verbeteren op collectieve basis. Het betreffen case studies van een Buurtorganisatie, een Wijntelersverbond en een ecologische wijncoöperatie. De cases tonen het belang aan van tussenpersonen, intermediairs: individuen die in staat zijn om het lokale met het globale te articuleren en vice versa, en om de globale prescripties waar mogelijk te vertalen, aan te passen en af te stemmen op de lokale realiteiten.     Het gebrek aan vaardige intermediairs is wat momenteel (semi-)overheids ontwikkelingsinterventies, waarvan hoofdstuk 5 er twee beschrijft, bemoeilijkt. Eén betreft het Plan voor de Verbetering van de Amandelteelt, een programma dat gefinancierd wordt door de Europese Unie en de spaanse overheid, en dat wordt uitgevoerd via een nationaal netwerk van coöperaties. In theorie is het bedoeld om de productiviteit van de amandelteelt te verhogen, maar in de praktijk blijkt het weinig meer dan een additionele bron van inkomsten voor de boeren. Het Plan is prescriptief wat betreft het gebruik van niet-organische inputs, en daardoor ontkent en vernietigt het Plan het lokale potentieel voor de ecologische teelt van amandelen, bijvoorbeeld door middel van de eerder genoemde groenbemester moruna.     De andere ontwikkelingsinterventie betreft het LEADER programma. Dit wordt eveneens gefinancierd door de Europese Unie, maar is veel rijker geschakeerd dan het Amandel Plan en is een werkelijke poging om rurale ontwikkeling te lokaliseren. Het LEADER programma voor de Alpujarra heeft echter een vooringenomenheid met het toerisme die ten koste gaat van steun aan de landbouw. Op deze wijze is het programma niet in staat haar relevantie te onderkennen voor de reproductie van het landschap, dat uiteindelijk een van de belangrijkste toeristische aantrekkingskrachten is. Hoewel het Alpujarra LEADER programma een werkelijke intermediair is tussen verschillende overheidsdiensten en de inwoners van het gebied, toont ze een geringe capaciteit om ontwikkeling te stimuleren die uitgaat van lokale strategieën, en nog minder van agrarische strategieën. In plaats van het stimuleren en voortbouwen op de pluriactiviteit op huhhoud~mvea.u leidt haar onbekendheid met de landbouwactiviteit tot een pluriactiviteit op regionaal niveau, d.w.z. tot toeristische en landbouwgebieden die nauwelijks economisch gearticuleerd zijn. Dit effect wordt zeker ook veroorzaakt door de nadruk op formele en bureaucratische procedures die geen of weinig ruimte laten voor lokale ontwikkelingsstrategieën en andere lokale hulpbronnen met ontwikkelingspotentieel. Dit is zeer zeker een van de sleutelproblemen voor de lokalisering van rural ontwikkeling.     Hoofdstuk 6 borduurt voort op dit sleutelprobleem en vormt daarom de spil in het boek. Er worden twee case studies in gedocumenteerd die een beeld geven van het enorme doorzettingsvermogen dat landbouwfamilies nodig hebben om de vele administratieve, fiscale en sanitaire beperkingen te overwinnen, die hen niet in staat stellen om financiële of andere hulp aan te vragen, en hun activiteiten te ontwikkelen. Zoals een lokaal uitdrukking zegt hebben zij letterlijk al hun cojones ('kloten') en maestria ('meesterschap', 'kundigheid') nodig. Eén geval betreft een kaasmakerij. De kracht van deze kaasmakerij ligt juist in de integratie van de veeteelt (schapen, geiten) voor de melkproductie, de transformatie van de melk in de kaas en de directe en lokale vermarkting hiervan. Bureaucratische verplichtingen segmenteren deze activiteiten op een industriële wijze, waardoor aan de ene kant grotere kosten gemaakt worden die de competitieve kracht van deze onderneming verzwakken, en er aan de andere kant endogeen ontwikkelingspotentieel verloren gaat. Dit betekent dat het paradoxaal genoeg veel makkelijker is voor deze kaasmakerij om een standaard Goudse kaas te maken dan een ongedocumenteerde, locale, traditionele verse kaas.     De andere case studie bediscussieert de evolutie en het functioneren van de wijnsector, met speciale aandacht voor de diverse vermarktingskanalen en de moeilijkheden die verbonden zijn aan de totstandkoming van een keurmerk, dat de herkomst van de lokale wijn beschermt tegen de verkoop van geïmporteerde wijn. Dit is een heikel thema in de Contraviesa; boeren hebben uiteenlopende en tegenstrijdige opvattingen over wat sinds het midden van de jaren tachtig te boek staat als de 'wijn-fraude'.     Hoofdstuk 6 legt het technisch en legaal pluralisme in de Contraviesa bloot in de beschrijving van de aard van het conflict tussen het lokale en het globale, het bijzondere en het universele, tussen de folk ways en de state ways (cf. Pitt-Rivers, 1961). Dit pluralisme heeft ruimte geschapen voor en wordt tegelijkertijd gevormd door wat ik ontwijkmanoeuvres noem ('movimientos de soslayo' in het Spaans, en 'evasive manoeuvres' in het Engels). Ontwijkmanoeuvres zijn historisch en sociaal geconstrueerde vormen van gedrag die strategisch worden ingezet om weg te duiken voor iets wat als negatief beschouwt wordt ten aanzien van iemands eigen positie, om dan weer te voorschijn te komen wanneer de kust veilig is. Boeren vragen bijvoorbeeld om bescherming en financiële steun voor de wijnsector, maar wanneer een registratie van de wijngaarden wordt uitgevoerd, nodig om een eventuele kwalificatie als 'herkomst gebied' (penominación de Origen) mogelijk te maken, is een aantal niet bereid om mee te werken uit vrees voor fiscale consequenties. Het Alpujarra LEADER programma vraagt een grotere participatie van de lokale bevolking, maar organiseert de formulering van de plannen op zulke wijze dat lokale ideeën en potentieel nauwelijks door kunnnen dringen. Onzichtbaarheid is daarom een strategische hulpbron. Tegelijkertijd proberen beide partijen juist die hulpbronnen van de ander te mobiliseren die de ander juist beschermt, omdat het om strategische hulpbronnen gaat (zoals overheidsionósen en lokaal spaargeld). Deze ontwijkmanoeuvres kunnen het beste worden begrepen, onder verwijzing naar Scott (1985), als alledaagse vormen van boeren- en overheidsverzet.     Niettemin constateer ik dat hoewel deze manoeuvres, voor zover het de boeren aangaat, goed mogen werken op het niveau van het individuele huishouden (gerelateerd aan het streven naar labrador -autonomie), het op zijn minst twijfelachtig is of deze geatomiseerde agency ook op de langere termijn effectief kan zijn. De behoefte aan nieuwe vormen van samenwerking moge duidelijk zijn, maar zijn niet eenvoudig te bewerkstelligen, zoals hoofdstuk 5 liet zien. Deze nieuwe vormen van samenwerking hoeven niet noodzakelijkerwijs gestalte te krijgen als formele collectieve organisaties (met een formele autoriteit), maar zouden wellicht in de eerste plaats kunnen worden gestimuleerd door een veel dichter netwerk van intermediairs op het veldniveau, die in staat zijn om de globale prescripties te vertalen naar lokale realiteiten, en omgekeerd. Daarom beweer ik dat er behoefte is aan een gesitueerde autoriteit, d.w.z. een autoriteit van actoren die kundig (fknowledgeable'), capabel (fcapable') en creatief zijn in zowel de lokale als de globale context. Dit is de voornaamste suggestie in dit boek voor de richting waarin LEADER zich zou kunnen ontwikkelen.     De exploratie: ontwerp capaciteit, creativiteit, experimenten, redundantie, analyse versus synthese     Onder de indruk van het vermogen van de inwoners van de Contraviesa om te overleven, om hun activiteiten voort te zetten en zelfs te vernieuwen, beschouw ik in hoofdstuk 7 de construerende en componerende aspecten van het leven van alledag. Ik exploreer verschillende paden.     Op de eerste plaats bekijk ik opnieuw het lokale gezegde iets doen con cojones y maestrta ('met kloten en kundigheid', en vervolgens doe ik het hetzelfde met de begrippen plan en performance zoals ik die in hoofdstuk 1 ontwikkeld heb. Dit brengt me ertoe de analogie te beschouwen tussen een landbouw performance en een jazz perfomance, activiteiten die vijf kernaspecten gemeen hebben - ritme, melodie, technische vaardigheid en een 'vormgevoel'. Het meesterschap over deze aspecten stelt een jazz musicus én een boer in staat om te improviseren, dat wil zeggen het exploreren van paden en het uitproberen van dingen die niet één-twee-drie onderkend en herkend worden door buitenstaanders, zoals wetenschappers (inclusief landbouwkundigen en musicologen). Het musicale begrip 'vormgevoel' is een evenknie van het begrip bedrijfsstijl, wat ons ertoe brengt het doelgerichte element in het menselijk handelen te heroverwegen. De ontwerpkracht die uitgaat van een duidelijke visie kan echter verfromfaaid worden door een gebrek aan leercapaciteit, dat vervolgens weer de tijdige bijstelling en afstemming van de doelen bemoeilijkt. Ik bespreek het griekse begrip over 'een karwei op sistimatikd manier klaren', zoals dat ontwikkeld is door cretenzer olijfboeren, en waarin liefde en een bereidheid tot leren essentieel zijn. Aan deze aspecten wordt gewoonlijk voorbijgegaan in de meeste zogenoemde systeembenaderingen van agrarische en rurale ontwikkeling. Leren, zo beweer ik, heeft veel te maken met het vermogen van een actor om iets uit zijn/haar context te herkennen als relevant voor zijn/haar plan; het is het vermogen om coherentie te zien dat het vermogen om coherentie te creëren mogelijk maakt. Met ander woorden, het berust op de creativiteit van actoren om zich elementen uit andere localiteiten (die hun contexten vormen) toe te eigenen, te deconstrueren en te transformeren, om ze vervolgens een plaats te geven in hun eigen localiteit (hun eigen plan). Dit is naar mijn mening in essentie wat ontwerpen is. Ontwerpen impliceert niettemin altijd een selectie gebaseerd op een bepaald perspectief; daarom impliceert het tevens dat andere opties (andere perspectieven) beschouwd worden als minder waard, rivaliserend, marginaal, afwijkend en uiteindelijk zelfs als onnodig en overbodig. Dit is het geval geweest van kleine en bergboeren, en in het algemeen van kennis die op niet-wetenschappelijke wijze is gegenereerd.     Ik bediskussieer het begrip overbodigheid ('redundancy') en beredeneer dat er een grote uitdaging bestaat gerelateerd aan het vermogen om afwijkingen te herkennen als kansen. Zo'n houding lijkt in staat te zijn om voorbij de moderniseringsgedachte te gaan en het meeste profijt te trekken van diversiteit. Deze diversiteit verwijst expliciet naar de capaciteit van alle actoren om zijn/haar projecten en leven te ontwerpen, ik beweer dat deze capaciteit te lang als overbodig is beschouwd, en beargumenteer dat de ontwerpcapaciteit ten aanzien van rural en agrarische ontwikkeling flink zou kunnen worden vergroot als het zou beginnen met het ineen klikken van de capaciteiten van de individuele actoren (inclusief die van formele organisaties). Empirische en beschrijvende benaderingen vormen een andere voorbeeld van een relevante zaak die geleidelijk aan als overbodig wordt beschouwd in de wetenschappelijke praxis, zelfs zo dat de theorie soms de werkelijkheid vervangt. Theorie (plannen, modellen) zouden moeten blijven leren van en zich laten inspireren door de werkelijkheid (context), om zo tot een nieuwe en vernieuwende wetenschapspraktijk (performances) te komen. Sociologische analyse is over het algemeen niet voldoende om ons dagelijkse leven te verrijken; het zegt veel over het verleden, maar weinig over de toekomst, en vaak kan het zelfs het heden niet bijbenen. Aan de andere kant bouwen voorspellende en gidsende modellen in economie en agronomie voort op een selectie van bekende ontwikkelingspaden uit het verleden, zijn ze niet in staat om mogelijke veranderingen in heden en toekomst op te nemen, en hebben weinig vermogen tot reflectie op de eigen performance. Zowel sociologie, economie als agronomie zouden gecomplementeerd moeten worden door een synthetische wetenschapsbenadering, een benadering die nieuwe coherentie bouwt door middel van een voortdurende reflectie tussen theorie en praktijk (actie).     Het boek besluit met een voorstel voor een sociologie van het ontwerpen.",0
A COMBINED EXPERIMENTAL AND DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF MUSIC ON READING AND LANGUAGE,"A combined experimental and descriptive study was carried out to explore the effect of music on the reading/language arts performance of first graders. Children were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Orff-Schulwerk music, visual arts or control. Following premeasures, the music and art groups met three times weekly for thirty minutes from December to May.    Pre and post measures included psychometric and edumetric tests: the Metropolitan Reading Readiness, the California Test of Basic Skills and the Botel Milestones criterion referenced reading test. Related areas of measurement were metalinguistic awareness, auditory-visual integration, following directions and concept development by the Goodenough-Harris ""Draw-a-Person"" test. Quantitative findings were treated by comparison plotting and analysis of variance, including mean differences, correlation and regression analysis with confidence level determination.    Qualitative procedures and assessments included documentation with field notes, observations, taped teacher: child interviews, monthly work samples, individual background data and assessments for following directions. Qualitative results were treated by retrospective analysis of field notes, interviews, observations and artifacts.    These analyses revealed that the music group began at a statistically significantly lower level that the other two, though undiscriminated by the Metropolitan Reading Readiness test. By the end of the program, they had imporved to the level of the other groups in reading and related areas.    Individual analysis of initially poor performers in all three groups showed that this improvement was not simply a growth spurt, but rather the effect of the music treatment.    The regression analysis revealed the strong impact of music treatment on concept development and reading perfomance, the latter not at a high confidence level. It also revealed a strong, adverse effect of non-English home language on reading, overcome only in the music group. The small number of such children here advises treating this result with caution.    Auditory-visual integration assessment compared success in three game-like tasks for sound reproduction, manipulation, and visual coding with reading stage and metalinguistic awareness, for the music group only. Prereaders were less successful in all three tasks. Levels of success and strategies were directly related to stage in metalinguistic awareness. Visual coding representation demonstrated increasing levels of abstraction from random to number to pattern. Metalinguistic awareness results showed the greatest growth for the music group, demonstrated in phonics activity, oral reading and spelling samples, and language expression.    Retrospective analysis described the effect of music as increasing attentional skills, manipulation-sound/strategy development, development of coordination of modalities, growth in self-concept and cooperation.    A model for the relationship of music to reading is proposed. Combining research in the areas of music, psycholinguistics, auditory-visual integration and Piagetian theory suggests that the child's purposeful cognitive structuring of the material increases success in reading tasks.    It is proposed that music accomplishes this by systematically teaching abstract sound manipulation and sound-to-visual code mapping, by providing structure and organization independent of a phoneme-based system, where the musical note acts as a syllable. Music provides this intersection of coordinating schemata, where the child learns strategies to manipulate and segment the sound and its visual representation.    Final conclusions are that music shows a demonstrated potential for enhancing reading and language development in the first grade. The combined methodologies--quantitative and qualitative--are essential to revealing the phenomena.",1
The Effects of Early Childhood English Language Education Program on Very Young Learners’ Vocabulary Knowledge and Communicative Skills,"The better quality English education programs integrating both Early Childhood Education and English Language Education disciplines and involving age-appropriate methodologies, materials and assessment are developed, the more likely young children are to obtain successful and long-lasting learning outcomes in target language. From this point of view, an English education program is developed in this thesis for very young learners considering their distinctive characteristics and diverse language learning needs. In order to examine the effectiveness of this program, two assessment instruments whose formats and procedures are in alignment with the aims of pre-primary foreign language education are designed, piloted and administered to very young learners as a part of empirical study. One of them is an English Picture Vocabulary Test (EPVT) for measuring children's receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge and the other one is Performance-based Assessment (PA) for assessing their communicative skills. These tools are pre-piloted with 20 children of the target age group and final piloted with 251 children from different private pre-primary schools. The internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson Formula 20) are found to be .89, .91, .98 respectively for both EPVT (Receptive), EPVT (Productive) and PA. The selection of upper and lower groups for the validation test items as a technique is used to analyze the discrimination power of PA and point-biserial correlation is used for the item difficulty and discrimination indices of EPVT. The findings indicate that EPVT and PA having ideal difficulty in terms of discrimination potential can serve as a valid and reliable assessment tool for assessing receptive and expressive vocabulary knowledge and basic communicative skills of very young EFL learners respectively.     In the second part of the study, the newly designed 'Early Childhood English Language Education Program' is piloted on a convenience sample of the target age group from a private pre-primary school to ensure the suitability of content, instructional materials, methods, approaches, principles and assessment tools with VYLs. After some corrections and improvements, the actual intervention is carried out at one of the public pre-primary schools in Beşiktaş/İstanbul. The study group consists of a total of 36 children, aged between 5 and 6 years who are randomly selected from 68 children in this pre-primary school. In this experimental research, the pretest, posttest and delayed posttest measurements are used. There are 18 children in both experimental group (M = 5 years and 11 months) and control group (M = 5 years and 10 months). The English learning hours that last for 40-45 minutes take place three times a week over 16 weeks. There are six common basic themes including 48 target vocabulary and certain structures with which children are familiar in their mainstream education. Whereas these themes are taught using traditional methods including repetition of decontextualized sentences, memorization of target vocabulary and teacher-led activities with flashcards and songs, same themes are taught to experimental group with communicative and interactive approaches including age-appropriate activities (e.g., thinking skill activities, art and craft activities, stories, drama activities, games, songs, parental involvement) in the scope of the program. EPVT and PA are used to measure VYLs' receptive and expressive vocabulary knowledge and communicative skills respectively. The findings of this study reveal that treatment group shows rapid gains in English word comprehension, production and communication skills. The children's listening and speaking skills in this group are developed in the target language as a result of their exposure to contextualized language learning in meaningful and enjoyable ways through play-based activities and interactive materials. The 'age' and 'gender' are not considered a significant factor in their L2 learning. The results of delayed posttest also demonstrate that effective TEVYL which has not only short term effects but also long-term; in other words, it provides long-lasting benefits in the L2 learning process. Results show clear evidence that quality L2 education program plays a crucial role in engaging children in active participation, sustaining their interest and developing their linguistic and communicative skills.     In addition, children's attitudes, perceptions and interpretations in both groups are elicited to find out about their L2 learning experiences in detail at the end of the intervention through semi-structured interviews. These interviews are analyzed with inductive content analysis which was one of the qualitative research techniques. In this study, 'mixed methods' approach in which qualitative and quantitative research are strategically combined at the data analysis level in order to illuminate each other is used. Considering the results of interview with very young learners on the issues such as the practices they are discouraged, the activities they like and dislike and the motivational factors that make the L2 learning easier, it can be concluded that their opinions and views about all aspects of the L2 education can provide invaluable feedback for teachers, researchers and policymakers.Alternate abstract:Erken Çocukluk ve İngilizce Eğitimi disiplinlerini birlikte ele alan, içerisinde okul öncesi dönem çocuklarının yaşına ve gelişimsel özelliklerine uygun yöntem, materyal ve değerlendirme metotları içeren kaliteli İngilizce eğitimi programları, bu çocukların hedef dildeki öğrenmelerini daha etkili ve kalıcı kılar. Buradan yola çıkarak, bu çalışmada okul öncesi dönem çocukların gelişimsel özellikleri ve farklı öğrenme ihtiyaçları göz önünde bulundurularak onlara yönelik bir İngilizce öğretimi programı geliştirilmiştir. Bu geliştirilen programın etkililiğini incelemek için, bu yaş grubunun ikinci dil öğretiminde ulaşabilecekleri hedefler ile uyumlu iki değerlendirme aracı tasarlanmış, pilot uygulaması yapılmış ve gerçek kullanıma hazır hale getirilmiştir. Bunlardan biri çocukların alıcı ve ifade edici kelime bilgisini ölçmek için hazırlanmış İngilizce Resimli Kelime Testi, diğeri ise temel iletişim becerilerini ölçmek için geliştirilmiş Performansa dayalı değerlendirme aracıdır. Bu araçlar önce 20 okul öncesi dönem çocuğu ile görüşülerek, uygulanabilirliği üzerine ön değerlendirme yapılmış, daha sonra 16 farklı özel anaokulundaki 251 çocuk ile pilot uygulaması yapılmıştır. Resimli kelime testinin alıcı dil ve ifade edici dil bölümleri ve performansa dayalı ölçme araçları için güvenilirlik katsayıları sırasıyla .89, .91 ve .98 olarak bulunmuştur. Resimli kelime testinde, maddelerin ayırt edicilik ve zorluk dereceleri Nokta çift serili Korelasyon Katsayısı bulunarak hesaplanmıştır. Diğer ölçme aracının madde güçlük indeksi ise alt ve üst grupların farkı belirlenerek yapılan madde analizi ile hesaplanmıştır. Sonuçlar İngilizce Resimli Kelime Testinin ve Performansa dayalı değerlendirme aracının ideal zorluğa sahip, geçerli ve güvenilir birer değerlendirme aracı olduklarını göstermektedir.     Çalışmanın ikinci bölümünde, 'Erken Çocukluk İngilizce Eğitimi Programı'nın içeriğini, programda kullanılan öğretim materyallerinin, yöntemlerinin ve değerlendirme araçlarının uygunluğunu değerlendirebilmek amacıyla, bu programın bir kısmı özel bir anaokulundaki öğrenci grubuna 3 hafta boyunca uygulanarak pilot uygulaması yapılmıştır. Gerekli düzeltmeler yapıldıktan sonra bu deneysel çalışma İstanbul’un Beşiktaş ilçesindeki bir anaokulunda uygulanmıştır. Araştırmanın çalışma grubunu bu anaokulundaki 68 çocuktan rastgele örnekleme yöntemiyle seçilen 5 ve 6 yaş grubu toplam 36 çocuk oluşturmaktadır. Bu deneysel çalışmada, rastgele seçilmiş ön test-son test grup tasarımı kullanılarak ön test, son test ve izleme ölçümleri arasındaki farkın anlamlılığına bakılmıştır. Deney ve kontrol grubunda 18’er çocuk bulunmaktadır. 16 hafta boyunca, 40-45 dakika süren İngilizce öğrenme saatinde, her haftanın başında ortasında ve sonunda olmak üzere toplam 3 kez çocuklar ile bir araya gelinmiştir. Program çocukların günlük yaşantılarından bildikleri 48 kelime ve bazı dil yapılarını içeren 6 temel konuyu içermektedir. Bu konular, kontrol grubuna bağlamdan uzaklaşmış bir yapı ile ve daha çok flaş kartların ve şarkıların kullanıldığı öğretmen merkezli etkinlikler ile öğretilirken, deneysel gruba aynı konular çocuğun yaşına uygun etkinlikleri (sanat, drama, düşünme becerileri etkinlikleri, hikâye anlatımı, oyunlar, şarkılar ve aile katılımı) içeren iletişimsel ve etkileşimli yaklaşımlar kullanılarak öğretilmiştir. Resimli Kelime Testi ve Performansa dayalı Değerlendirme aracı ile çocukların sırasıyla alıcı ve ifade edici kelime bilgileri ve iletişim becerileri değerlendirilmiştir. Sonuçlar, deney grubundaki çocukların hedef kelimeleri anlama, ifade etme ve onlar ile iletişim kurabilme becerilerinin diğer gruba göre daha iyi olduğunu ortaya koymuştur. Yine bu gruptaki çocukların dinleme ve konuşma becerilerinin, maruz kaldıkları anlamlı ve eğlenceli oyun temelli etkinlikler ve etkileşimli materyaller aracılığı ile daha çok geliştiği gözlemlenmektedir. Yaş ve cinsiyet faktörlerinin öğrenme sürecinde bir etkisi olmadığı bulunmuştur. Bunun yanı sıra, izlence testinin sonuçları hazırlanan programının kesintiye uğramadan uygulandığı takdirde küçük çocukların İngilizce öğrenme süreçlerine uzun süreli katkı sağladığını göstermiştir. Son olarak bu çalışma, kaliteli bir İngilizce eğitimi programının, çocukların aktif katılımını sağlayarak, ilgilerini sürekli canlı tutarak onların dilsel ve iletişimsel becerilerini geliştirmelerinde önemli bir rol oynadığına dair net kanıtlar ortaya koymaktadır.     Ayrıca, her iki grupta bulunan çocuklardan, uygulanan programın sonunda yapılan görüşmeler ile öğrenme deneyimlerine ilişkin düşünceleri alınmıştır. Bu yarı yapılandırılmış görüşmeler, nitel araştırma tekniklerinden biri olan tümevarımsal içerik analizi tekniği ile yorumlanmıştır. Bu çalışmada, nitel ve nicel araştırmaların birbirlerini aydınlatmak amacıyla veri analizi düzeyinde stratejik olarak birleştirildiği ""karma yöntemler"" yaklaşımı kullanılmıştır. Küçük çocuklar ile hoşlandıkları/ hoşlanmadıkları etkinlikler, yabancı dili öğrenme süreçlerini kolaylaştıran ve zorlaştıran konular üzerine yapılan bu görüşmenin sonuçları göz önüne alındığında, çocukların öğretme-öğrenme sürecinin tüm yönleriyle ilgili görüşlerinin öğretmenler, araştırmacılar ve politika yapıcılar için son derece önemli geri bildirim sağlayabileceği sonucuna varılabilir.",0
The Effects of Digital Storytelling on Student Learning and Engagement in the Secondary World Language Classroom,"This action research study involved the development and enactment of a unit in a secondary French world language classroom using digital storytelling.  The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of digital storytelling on student engagement and language acquisition through the design and employment of a unit using digital storytelling software.  Digital storytelling was chosen for its modern influence of narrative customization using digital features such as voice recordings, video clips, images, and music.  In addition, other components were identified including multiple drafts, peer-collaboration, and student-choice.  The secondary purpose of this study was to address the importance of teacher expertise and self-efficacy in using technology to effectively employ digital storytelling within a unit through researcher self-reflection.     This action-research study provided notable findings that supported the need of incorporating digital storytelling in the classroom.  Although there were a variety of student responses to the project, the results indicate that students were highly-engaged throughout the unit as they demonstrated proficiency in language acquisition.  Critical components of the unit consisted of multiple modes of communication, mini-lessons, and student work.     Digital storytelling works in tandem with the school’s goal of innovation in the classroom through modern pedagogical choices.  To that end, digital storytelling addresses the disconnect between the necessary student engagement in language acquisition and the traditional, decontextualized instructional methods still used in many world language classes.  The principal language learning goals of this project include the correct usage of the passé composé of reflexive verbs with contextual vocabulary to communicate about one’s daily routine.",0
The Potential of Music in Engaging Students to Learn English,"The aims of the present teaching report, integrated in the Master of Teaching English in Primary Education, are to describe, interpret and evaluate the Intervention Project “The potential of music in engaging students to Learn English”.This project was developed with fourth-graders in a primary school. Exploring and investigating the potential of music in the classroom as a way to engage and motivate students in learning English as a second language was the main intent of the project. Its objectives were: identifying students’ attitudes towards English language learning in general and specifically their sentiment towards music, promoting students’ engagement using activities related to music, helping students develop their ""learning to learn"" ability, and evaluating gains and limitations of using music in the classroom.In the first stage of the project there was a period of field observation, where I was able to collect data using direct classroom observation and guided observation with the help of an observation grid. I tried to make a profile of the class in order to perceive their engagement in the English class and their attitude towards English learning and music, which was essential to start incorporating music activities in class. I used music for various purposes: to initiate and end lessons, to learn vocabulary/new lexis, to compose a verse for a song and with TPR. These different music activities were part of three didactic sequences, and after each sequence students could evaluate not only what they felt towards the music activities but also what they had learnt in that sequence. This enabled students to develop self-evaluation abilities and provided information for analysing my action.Based on the project results, I came to the conclusion that music is a very powerful tool, enabling students to learn English in a stress-free and playful way. So, music has the potential of engaging and motivating students.",0
Conductor's Guide to Lyric Diction in Standard Chinese,"Chinese choral music is a relatively recent phenomenon. Within the last century, Chinese conductors and choral ensembles have actively fostered a vibrant choral community. Furthermore, Chinese composers have taken increasing interest in the choral art, resulting in a growing body of new choral repertoire. Contemporary Chinese choral music adopts western choral approaches such as voice parts (SATB), style (bel canto), harmony and structure, but retains Chinese texts.     In order to introduce Chinese choral art music to English-speaking choirs, conductors must be equipped with good resources to deepen their understanding of the choral culture in China. More importantly, they need supportive materials to help them tackle the challenges of the language. Currently there are few guides to lyric diction in Standard Chinese for singers and choral conductors. The primary goal of this study is to break down the complexity of the pronunciation of this language, using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and Pinyin systems, to provide a helpful guide to conductors in teaching Chinese choral music.     A secondary goal is to introduce choral musicians to contemporary Chinese choral music. In addition to outlining the history of choral music in China, this study also includes analyses of five original compositions written within the last decade, in order to provide examples of original choral works in Standard Chinese written by Chinese composers from different geographical backgrounds: Hong Kong, China, the United States, and Canada. These analyses are supplemented with the composers’ biographies, program notes, and analytical information that may be helpful for pedagogical purposes. Through my research, I seek to champion interest in this sub-genre of music that is otherwise not well known currently in North America, both by providing a guide to teaching lyric diction in Chinese and by promoting original compositions written by modern Chinese composers.",0
"Music therapy in hospice: Spanish language repertoire, approaches, and challenges","The purpose of this study was to investigate Spanish language repertoire with Spanish-speaking patients, as well as specific techniques and challenges used by music therapists in the hospice setting. An electronic survey was sent out to music therapists via email and social media, whereby 17 music therapists completed the survey. The first section of the survey asked what Spanish language songs music therapists use most frequently in the following genres: Traditional/folk; Patriotic; Religious; Popular; Children’s; and Other. The second section of the survey consisted of approaches and techniques music therapists used in their practice with Spanish-speaking patients, as well as well as challenges they have encountered. The results of this study revealed a total of 49 songs used by music therapists. Results also indicated the music therapy intervention, “singing for reminiscence”, as their most frequently used. Regarding challenges faced when working with Spanish-speaking patients, language barrier was a common factor that music therapists faced. Further results are discussed in the paper.",0
The influence of mother tongue on young children's rhythmic behaviour in singing,"Singing and speaking are closely allied to one other. They are both produced by the same anatomical structures within the human body, although the coordination with the neuroanatomy is differentiated between speech and song. For the young child, existing literature suggests that the border between singing and speaking is opaque, at least in the early years of human life. In order to understand the relationship (if any) between mother tongue in speech and children's singing, a series of empirical studies was undertaken. In the first of these, a specialist rhythmic and linguistic analysis tool (nPVI) was applied to participant three- to five-year-old Japanese and English children's singing of well-known songs. Two subsequent studies explored (2) the rhythmic basis of Japanese and English children's printed song materials and (3) adults' hand clapping of their remembered children's songs from their childhood. Data analyses revealed that children's singing development appears to be influenced in two dimensions by their mother tongue. One is through a direct influence of the mother tongue's underlying rhythm (a distinctive characteristic of spoken language), and the other is an influence from the rhythm of the song materials that are common in the home culture. From the analysis of young children's actual singing, it was found that the underlying rhythmic bias of the home language was differentially related to the singing behaviour according to age and location (England or Japan). Another finding was an apparent preference for certain rhythm patterns within each language group. From the analysis of printed song material, different trends in rhythmic structure were found in Japanese and English children's songs. The influence of the home language rhythm appeared to be more direct in English songs, but not in Japanese songs. In particular, the difference between the bias towards an equal-timed rhythm of the Japanese language and the ""childlike"" nature of the songs brought an intensive use of the 3:1 dotted rhythm pattern. The common use of dotted rhythm was also linked to the double structure of Japanese language rhythm. This bias was also confirmed by an analysis of example hand clapping of children's songs by participant adults in the third study. Overall, the data suggest that any relationship between mother tongue and singing is culturally located and also developmental in nature.",0
"Taking Back <i>Mi Lengua</i>: Spanish Rock, Space, and Authenticity in Chicana/o Barrios & Academia","My goal is to understand forms of cultural survival for Chicanas/os 1 who attend U.S. public school systems, from K–12 to post-secondary education. I argue that U.S. public schools are invested in assimilating people of color into English speaking mainstream Americans, and in the process create an environment of shame and low self-esteem that students then carry with them throughout their academic paths. The dissertation will focus on the legitimacy placed on English language and the ostracizing of those who do not or cannot comply with U.S. linguistic standards imposed by public school models. In conversation with canonical American Studies works that describe the formation of this nation, this dissertation research will focus on how Chicana/o identity is shaped by the loss of language and forced assimilation. Centered in a society that highly values English speakers, this dissertation work will review literature that reflects the daily struggles of those who do not fit the hegemonic standards of the U.S. and their strategies of recovering access to Spanish to create their own cultural language “in between” these cultural worlds. In particular, I will explore this process through an engagement of Spanish language rock music or rock en Español.    In the U.S., Spanish language music had a significant spike in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s with what was dubbed by the media as the “Latin Explosion.” This cultural phenomenon has been marked with the mainstream popularity success of artists like Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, and Jennifer Lopez. While much of their success was due to English language lyrics by Latino artists, many artists who only sang in Spanish benefited from the popularity and had much success in the U.S. This dissertation work focuses on those artists who were/are not only invested in Spanish language rock, but I argue are also speaking back to romanticized notions of Mexican nationalism that allow Chicanas/os to access alternative spaces for knowledge production. A focus on Spanish language rock in this paper will shed light on spaces that facilitate expression of a contemporary Chicana/o identity related to but separate from the 1960’s Chicano nationalist period. This paper will test the argument that these sites of knowledge facilitate not only brief acts of awareness to a particular issue, but spark moments of political consciousness that inform other forms of quotidian action. More specifically, this dissertation will focus on the ways that engagement with these sites of knowledge facilitate dialogues that begin to challenge narratives of Chicanas/os as criminals, delinquents, and as an overall burden to U.S. society. I argue that these sites of knowledge create a transnational dialogue that allows many Chicanas/os in the U.S. to feel as if they have a place/space in which they belong; an identity that transgresses the legal border.    1 Chicana/o will be used to describe first, second, and beyond generation migrants who have significant time in U.S. systems like public schools.",0
Levanten la mano si me entienden: Receptive bilinguals' linguistic and cultural perceptions in secondary Spanish classes,"Receptive bilinguals have been in a dilemma of knowing just enough Spanish to write and aurally comprehend the curriculum at the beginning-intermediate levels of a Spanish language course. This dichotomy in classrooms with mixed-ability learners has created a need to reconsider placement and pedagogical structures tailored for these students in foreign language courses. Thus, this descriptive study examined the perceptions of receptive bilinguals, drawn from two secondary Spanish courses regarding receptive bilinguals’ language use, personal Spanish language abilities and confidence, personal beliefs about the language, and contentment with the course.   For this study, 31 participants were selected from two public high schools in a suburb of a large metropolitan area in north Texas. Two surveys, a listening assessment and an online questionnaire, were administered at the end of the academic year. The Likert questionnaire items were analyzed using SPSS software, while open-ended questions were coded for recurrent themes. Analyses revealed four major findings. First, with regard to influence on language use, participants’ grandparents created the most interaction with the Spanish language when compared with the other family groups. In addition, Spanish influence through television, literature, radio, and music contributed to students’ early childhood Spanish learning. Second, as to language preference, although participants perceived English to be the language with which they were most at ease, they were also confident in their Spanish conversational abilities. Third, with respect to perceptions of language abilities, Spanish 2Pre-AP students noticed an increased ability in listening, speaking, and writing the language. In both courses, students’ receptive ability was one of the highest abilities. Receptive bilinguals reflected a sense of pride and passion for the language. They desired to improve their language through their own selfmotivation as a way to connect with family. Fourth, and finally, in reporting on course contentment, participants expressed overall contentment with the course, irrespective of the particular course in which they were enrolled; however, some did not agree that all curricular structures were to their benefit. Results indicate a need to place students with receptive bilingual skills in courses designed to meet their specific linguistic characteristics.",0
Promoting school readiness in at-risk children: An evaluation of the Circle of Education program in preschool and kindergarten classrooms,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the services provided by the Circle of Education (COE) program, a music- and literacy-based school readiness program, in preschool and kindergarten classrooms in a school serving mostly low-income, Latino children. This paper describes the implementation of running the program that entailed college student interns leading twelve lessons in the classrooms, while parent leaders led eleven lessons in Spanish with parents who left the classes with materials needed to run the activity at home with their children. Lessons were selected from the COE program that corresponded with trauma related symptoms (e.g., self-esteem, emotional regulation, friendship and cooperation, self care, and school climate). Additionally, these lessons incorporated Latino cultural values: familismo, personalismo, and respeto. The results of this study provide feedback from student interns and parents who participated in the program implementation during the school year and reflected on the program’s efficacy in improving school readiness. The results of this study are inconclusive in suggesting that the intervention program, COE, was effective in enhancing school readiness skills in preschool and kindergarten children from high risk populations. However, much was learned about the process of coordinating services between multiple stakeholders. Results of this study suggest that improving the implementation of the COE program with greater treatment fidelity, generalization, and maintenance may lead to increases in fostering self-esteem, improving emotional regulation, promoting friendship and cooperation, encouraging self-care skills, and improve school climate. Further investigation is warranted in how to better implement the program in order to reproduce and duplicate positive results of parent engagement across settings.",0
The impact of the English language policy in the basic education core curriculum b.e. 2551(a.d. 2008) on English instruction of Thai secondary EFL teachers: A multiple case study in northeast Thailand,"This study examined how Thai EFL teachers understood the English language policy in the Basic Education Core Curriculum B.E. 2551 (A.D. 2008) and how their understanding impacted their classroom practice. A multiple case study was conducted with two EFL teachers at a government secondary school in the rural area in the northeast of Thailand. Data collection methods included classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and analysis of documents. Hornberger’s (2006) integrative framework was used to analyze how the two teachers made sense of this policy. The findings of this study demonstrate that both EFL teachers understand the English language policy in the Basic Education Core Curriculum B.E. 2551 (A.D. 2008), as acquisition planning and status planning which corresponds to the policy planning adopted by the Basic Education Core Curriculum B.E. 2551 (A.D. 2008). However, the findings show that a gap exists between the goals of the policy and what the teachers actually do in their classrooms. Even though they acknowledged the importance of learner-centered and communicative approach, there was not much evidence of this method used in their classes. Instead, these teachers tended to transmit knowledge to their students in a teacher-centered manner, with the focus on translation and choral repetition drills. This study suggests the need for more professional development and training for these teachers. It also argues that the policy itself needs to be critically examined.",0
The Effect of Age on Second Language Acquisition in Older Adults,"A primary purpose of second language (L2) research is to determine what factors hinder or help L2 acquisition. One aspect that has a strong effect on L2 proficiency is learners' age of onset of acquisition (AOA) (Johnson & Newport, 1989). These studies and others suggest that younger learners are more adept than older learners at learning an L2, especially to a near-native level. However, some older learners can become quite proficient in an L2 (Ioup, et al. 1994; Bialystok, 1997; Bongaerts, 1999), although learners who have acquired the L2 over the age of 30 are rarely studied. Why is it that some older learners are more adept at learning a second language than others? Some argue cognitive abilities (Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson, 2002; DeKeyser, 2006) while others argue social and affective factors (Moyer, 1999) differ across the lifespan, causing younger learners to achieve a higher proficiency than older learners. Little research, however, has examined both these factors, especially in learners who acquired a language beyond early adulthood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine 1) if there are age effects between groups of older adults learning an L2 and 2) what causes any differences found. This study examines a variety of both cognitive, affective and demographic factors that have been previously shown to affect language learning. The participants included 38 native Spanish speakers placed into four AOA groups: 10–19, 20–29, 30–39, and over 40. In order to test cognitive factors a working memory task as well as a switch task were included (Abrahamsson, 2012; Paradis, 2009). Other factors were assessed using a survey that inquired about motivation, amount of time using the L1 versus the L2, and musical ability (Slevc & Miyake, 2006). Subjects also participated in an elicited imitation task to assess global proficiency in the L2 (Erlam, 2009). Results suggest that age effects are found even in older learners. Participants with a younger AOA who spend more time speaking the L2 (English) tended to have greater proficiency in the L2. Attentional control was also a predictor.",0
An early start to french literacy: learning the spoken and written word simultaneously in english primary schools,"The Primary MFL curriculum (DfE, 2013: 1-3) calls for the development of reading and writing in a foreign language in primary schools. Specific attainment targets refer to “accurate reading aloud for understanding” and the ability to “describe people, places, things and actions orally and in writing” (DfE, 2013: 2). Research, however, has shown both the teaching and learning of MFL literacy to be most problematic. Observation-derived evidence noted that writing was the “least developed skill” in primary MFL provision (Ofsted, 2011: 10, 25) and that written work tended to provide consolidation and support for oral learning (Cable, Driscoll, Mitchell, Sing, Cremin, Earl, Eyres, Holmes, Martin & Heins, 2010: 87). Meanwhile, empirical evidence holds that a lack achievement and motivation in school-based language learning is a reflection of limited progression in second language literacy and decoding (Erler, 2003; Macaro & Erler, 2008; 2011). Despite these findings, research has yet to identify teaching and learning approaches which could shape pedagogical practice and deliver the “substantial progress” that the curriculum expects (DfE, 2013: 2). This action research study, conducted over 23 weeks, presents an empirically-derived, principled and systematic approach to teaching MFL literacy and oracy simultaneously. Qualitative and quantitative data, collected throughout the intervention and at pre-, post- and delayed post-test allowed for both detailed statistical analyses of learning outcomes and the exploration of the learning process. The study finds that, in this beginner learner setting, MFL oracy is not disrupted by the simultaneous introduction of MFL literacy. It notes that both L1 reading age and verbal working memory proficiency are highly influential in L2 oracy and literacy learning but reports that learners across the L1 ability range can participate in L2 learning and make meaningful progress. It further suggests that the development of L2 sound/spelling links (through systematic phonics instruction) is slow and that familiar words are more likely to be successfully recoded. These findings together ii with evidence of an ever-dominant L1, support an argument for an early start to MFL literacy.",0
Hugo Distler (1908-1942): Recontextualizing Distler's music for performance in the twenty-first century,"Hugo Distler has been recognized as a forerunner of the New German Church Music, an important musical movement which developed in the 1930s. Beyond his role in developing music for the worship service, Distler wrote many secular choral compositions which represent some of the most innovative and important contributions to German choral music of the twentieth century. While he achieved great popularity during his lifetime and is widely regarded as a high-quality and important composer, his music has gone in and out of popularity in the United States. While there have been various scholarly contributions, primarily initiated by Larry Palmer's book of 1967, focusing on his life and works, a need for new research on Distler remains.     The aforementioned text by Larry Palmer and an earlier document by Charles R. Anders provide extensive biographical information about Distler. However, details of his family history and early childhood are largely disregarded. A new German-language biography which provides much greater detail in this area was written by Distler's daughter, Barbara Distler-Harth, in 2008. The details of his family and early childhood help to provide great insight into Distler's developing psyche and are thus provided in the current document for the first time to an English-speaking audience. Beyond biographical information, editions of previously unreleased Distler works have been prepared in the last twenty years, and these works have not been previously addressed in any academic research.    It is the intention of this document to advocate for the study and performance of Hugo Distler's music by providing context for his music in both musical and ideological frameworks. The identification of specific stylistic characteristics is intended to breakdown the challenges of Distler's music, which will make it more accessible to choral conductors and singers. Whereas previous research has primarily focused on larger works such as the Choralpassion and Eine deutsche Choralmesse or the challenging motets of his Geistliche Chormusik, this document will provide information on several smaller works, including pieces from Der Jahrkreis,  Mörike-Chorliederbuch, and others. It is my belief that in order for Distler's work to gain in popularity, church and school choirs must give it increased performance, rather than professional choirs giving increased performance of his most challenging works.",0

Scaffolding Chinese Teaching and Learning.,"Scaffolding is an important part of language teaching and learning. It is a metaphor for a dynamic process intended to enable teachers to solve their problems of having students learn a second language. However, there is little research into how teachers can scaffold the teaching/learning of Chinese by second language learners in English speaking countries. The research project reported in thesis explores different kinds of scaffolding to determine which might be useful for making Chinese learnable, by having students use their L1 (English) to learn the L2 (Chinese), the target language. In order to find the answers to the research questions, a self-study narrative inquiry was employed as the main research method. The data were collected from interviews, documents, reflection journal and questionnaires. Through the analysis of this data set, it is argued that three types of scaffolding are useful for making Chinese learnable by L2 learners, namely, music-based scaffolding, sociolinguistic-activity-based scaffolding and pattern-based scaffolding. This thesis presents a range of evidence about these three modes of scaffolding. Music-based scaffolding was used to with Kindergarten to Year 3 students to promote their Chinese language learning. Second, sociolinguistic-activity-based scaffolding made it possible for students in Year 4 to Year 6 to practise Chinese as an everyday sociolinguistic activity and develop their own self-scaffolding for learning Chinese. Third, like other forms of scaffolding, pattern-based scaffolding was used to reduce Year 4 to Year 6 students' cognitive load when learning the complexities of Chinese, which included a shift from teacher scaffolding to students' own scaffolding. This thesis provides several evidence-driven models for other teachers of Chinese to draw upon to make Chinese learnable for English speaking students.",0
Using Songs to Enhance Language Learning and Skills in the Cypriot Primary EFL Classroom,"Although the role of songs in the primary EFL classroom has attracted the interest of a number of researchers (Newham 1995; McMullen and Saffran 2004; Millington 2011), given the frequency with which songs are being used in English language teaching classrooms, it might have been expected that Cyprus would wish to play a role in extending research findings and applying them to its own educational setting. Yet the lack of research with young learners is particularly acute in the Cypriot Primary School EFL context where pupils have been working for the last 15 years with very outdated textbooks. Evidence of the effectiveness of using songs to learn English has come mainly from studies in other countries mainly with older pupils in middle and high schools, (Adkins 1997; Millington 2011; Fonseca-Mora et al. 2011). My research, therefore, aims to address this gap by attempting to find out whether songs could play an important role in learning a foreign language with Cypriot learners of 9-12, an age range that has not so far been addressed in the literature. In my study, I examine the potential of songs as a valuable pedagogical tool to help young pupils learn English. More specifically, I investigate the role of songs (1) in arousing positive emotions in the primary language classroom and (2) in determining whether and to what extent positive emotions can help to reinforce the grammatical structures being taught and aid vocabulary acquisition. Using an ethnographic case study framework, my study attempted, through the use of quantitative and qualitative methods, to assess the effectiveness of working with songs in the EFL classroom. The findings of this research revealed that the majority of pupils taking part in the study following the normal EFL curriculum which involved two 40-minute EFL lessons a week, showed considerable improvement in language learning after the use of songs. This suggested that the framework of EFL competence in Cyprus might also benefit from the implementation of songs into the current English language curriculum.",1
"In-service elementary ESOL teachers' perspectives, usage, and difficulties of teaching English through music","Due to the increasing numbers of English Language Learners (ELLs) in the U.S., additional ways of teaching English need to be discovered. This study was designed to investigate teachers of English for Speakers of Other Languages’ (ESOL) perspectives, usage, and difficulties of teaching English through music. Missouri in-service elementary ESOL teachers (N=108), responded to a researcher-designed online survey, which collected the participants’ background information, their perspectives on using music, the methods they used to incorporate music into their classes, and their difficulties and needs. The majority of participants perceived a positive effect of music on students’ learning, and felt comfortable singing and teaching songs to their students. However, they reported a generally low use of music to teach English, with vocabulary being the English language skill taught most frequently with music. Singing songs was the most popular music activity, and children’s songs were the most commonly used genre. Songs that include repetition were the most frequently chosen criteria for song selection, and having students echo line-by-line was the most frequently used music teaching method. The majority of the ESOL teachers preferred finding music materials and resources through the Internet, and online video clips were the most popular. The main obstacles reported were a lack of time in the class schedule and lack of training in teaching with music, knowledge about music resources, music integration, and song selections. Recommendations include a redesign of teacher preparation and professional development programs to incorporate strategies and materials for teaching English through music.",0
The effect of singing tempo during specific song acquisition of preschool aged children,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of singing tempo during specific song acquisition of preschool aged children. The study had two research questions: 1. What is the effect of slow and fast singing tempos on preschool children’s performance of musical components (melody, rhythm, and text, individually and combined) of a duple major song over time? 2. Will children’s performance tempo be the same as or similar to the presented instructional tempo?    Participants were randomly assigned by classroom to Tempo Group A (120 beats per minute) or Tempo Group B (60 bpm). A three week pilot study ( N = 14) validated the teaching procedures, recording procedures, and the scoring rubric. During the six week main study, participants ( N = 50) were exposed to the song 30 times. Three judges evaluated individual performance recordings from the pilot study and the individual midpoint and final performances from the main study in three dimensions: melody, rhythm, and text.    Interjudge reliabilities were calculated using a Pearson product moment reliability. Data analysis used a two-way Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with repeated measures for the individual components and an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures for the composite score. The melodic scores, the rhythmic scores, the text scores, and the composite scores showed statistically significant growth for both groups from the week three recordings to the week six recordings. There was no statistically significant difference between the instructional tempo groups.    The mean of complete performances for both tempo treatment groups moved toward the center of the tempo range (60–120 bpm) Using a t -test, the change in performance tempo from instructional tempo was statistically significant. Further research is needed for specialized groups (English as a Second Language, developmental delays, and different tonalities/meters).",0
Effects of curricular content on the choral music preferences of adolescents,"The purpose of this research was to investigate factors affecting choral music preferences of adolescents.  The rationale for this research comes from the importance of teaching culturally diverse music in 21st-century music classrooms and the possibility that curricular content and ethnic identity may affect preferences for this music.  Six research questions guided the study: (1) How are middle school students' preferences for choral arrangements of folk music grouped?  (2) Is there a significant main effect of type of curriculum content instruction on middle school choral students' choral music preference scores? (3) Is there a significant main effect of time on middle school choral students' choral music preference scores? (4) Is there a significant type of curriculum content by time interaction? (5) Descriptively, within each ethnic group, does strength of identity relate differently to growth in scores in different interventions?  (6) How do middle school students describe their reasons for their preference?     One hundred and thirty-two sixth, seventh, and eighth grade chorus members (11 to 15 years old) participated in the study.  Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups receiving different curricular content: music concept-based, sociocultural-based, or discussion-based.  At the outset of the study, all subjects took a measure of ethnic identity.  Two weeks later, all subjects took a preference pretest of eight music excerpts from choral arrangements of folk songs originating from the following cultures: African, American, Asian, and Latin American/Caribbean.  One week after their pretest session, subjects took a posttest while simultaneously receiving one of three interventions based on one of three approaches to curricular content.     Two factors emerged from principal axis factor analysis of pretest scores.  The first factor (simple texture subscale) included arrangements of folk songs with simple unison or predominantly homophonic vocal textures.  The second factor (complex texture subscale) included arrangements of folk songs with complex polyphonic vocal textures.  A split-plot ANOVA analysis revealed no statistically significant main effects of intervention or time, and no statistically significant interaction of intervention and time for the simple texture subscale.  A second split-plot ANOVA revealed no statistically significant main effects, but a statistically significant interaction of intervention and time for the complex texture subscale.  A regression analysis revealed that adding ethnic identity scores to preference pretest scores did not help predict to a significantly better extent posttest scores for any of the three intervention groups.       Subjects' open-ended responses were placed into one of four categories:  musical, sociocultural/linguistic, affect , or perception of performance.  Subjects in the sociocultural-based group wrote more sociocultural/linguistic comments than subjects in the other two groups, and subjects in the discussion-based group wrote more affect comments than subjects in the other two groups.  Subjects in all three groups seemed to lack the musical vocabulary to describe why they liked or disliked the selections.  Comments about  perception of performance most often referred to subjects' perceptions that singing songs with complex textures or songs in a foreign language would be too difficult for their chorus.     Numerous factors interact to affect music preferences. By continuing to study their students' music preferences, general music teachers and choral directors can gain further insights into how to best approach culturally unfamiliar music.  Using a combination of music concept-based, sociocultural-based, and discussion-based curricular content may be an answer to ways to foster positive preferences for culturally unfamiliar choral music.  Focusing on curricular content is important; however, general music teachers and choral directors may find success by initially introducing students to culturally unfamiliar choral music with simple vocal textures before songs with complex vocal textures.",0
"British influence on New Zealand choral traditions: A study of the relationship between choral festivals and societies in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand, with focus on New Zealand's high school festival 'The Big Sing'","The Big Sing festival (TBS) in New Zealand exists as an extension of the British¹ tradition of such choral festivals, a heritage that dates back as far as the establishment of the Welsh eisteddfod competitive festival tradition and later, the English Sons of Clergy non-competitive meetings in the seventeenth century. While TBS has only existed in its present format since 1988, the reasons for its success and rapid growth are rooted in this strong British tradition, which was inherited as part of Britain’s colonization of New Zealand in the nineteenth century. The presence of and support for choral activities in many New Zealand school, community and church events mirrors the popularity of choral singing as a pastime throughout the British Isles in the nineteenth century. While TBS is a competitive festival for secondary school choirs, I believe that the choral traditions represented in and supported by the festival, both competitive and non-competitive, are a product of British colonial influence.    Also influential in the development and success of the festival has been the establishment of elite national choirs (primarily the New Zealand Youth Choir, New Zealand Secondary Students Choir and the professional choir Voices New Zealand),² which has set up a sequence of choral goals for exceptional young New Zealand singers. The establishment of the competitively auditioned national touring choirs in New Zealand provides significant incentive for students to practice and develop their skills as members of their local school and community choirs; such local growth in turn raises standards within the regions.    In Part One I will outline the chronological history of choral societies, as well as non-competitive and competitive festivals, in both Britain and New Zealand, emphasizing common threads between the two traditions. I chose the year 1900 as an end point for the history of British festivals, for two reasons: first, the initial decades of the twentieth century saw major political and cultural changes that significantly altered the choral landscape of Britain, and, second, the fact that by the turn of the century, New Zealand had established a significant enough population base to support its own version of the British models, events that no longer needed to mirror so closely contemporary British trends. Examples of which choral societies and festivals to study in both nations were selected based on two criteria: 1. Longevity, size, and significance of the society or festival, and 2. Availability of historical information relating to the society or festival.    Part Two narrates the history of TBS itself, specifically focusing on those ensembles and directors that achieved conspicuous success, the repertoire performed and original data consisting of archival materials of these disparate festivals, as well as an original survey, designed by the author to allow those individuals surveyed to elaborate on their view of the significance of the country’s largest choral festival and its impact on choral life in New Zealand.    ¹The terms ‘Britain’ and ‘British’ are used with care in this dissertation, as is the term ‘United Kingdom.’ References to the UK have political implications respecting the post-1921 boundaries of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern and Southern Ireland. Trends and ideas identified as ‘British’ refer to those cultural traditions which are common amongst most inhabitants of the British Isles, irrespective of ethnicity. ²The National Male Choir of New Zealand is also an auditioned choir, but is not generally considered to be part of this elite tier of choirs.",0

The Impact of Authentic Animated Stories On Young Learners' Vocabulary Learning In Elt Classes,"Bu çalışmada, kelime öğretim materyali olarak özgün animasyon hikâyelerinin kullanımının, çocukların kelime öğrenimine olan etkisi, onların kelime testlerindeki başarıları temel alınarak incelenmiştir. Bu amaç doğrultusunda, deneysel bir araştırma yöntemi, Kocaeli'deki bir devlet ilköğretim okulundaki 55 dördüncü sınıf öğrencisine uygulanmış ve çalışma esnasında, bu iki gruba 42 hedef kelime öğretilmiştir. Çalışma dahilindeki aynı yaşlarda ve aynı seviyelerde İngilizce bilgisine sahip öğrenciler, biri kontrol diğeri deney grubu olmak üzere iki farklı gruba ayrılmışlardır. Çalışma süresince kontrol grubuna resimli kartlar, şarkılar ve ders kitabı gibi geleneksel materyallerle kelime öğretilirken, deney grubuna özgün animasyon hikâyeler aracılığıyla hedef kelimeler öğretilmiştir. İki gruba da aynı ön-test ve son testler uygulanmıştır. Çalışma sonunda, sonuçlar, özgün animasyon hikâyeler aracılığıyla kelime öğretiminin diğer geleneksel materyaller ile kelime öğretimine göre daha iyi bir öğrenme sağladığını göstermiştir.Alternate abstract:In this paper, the role of using authentic animated stories as vocabulary teaching materials on young learners vocabulary development in terms of their success in vocabulary tests was investigated. To achieve this goal, an experimental case study was performed on 55 fourth grade students at a state primary school in Kocaeli and 42 target words were taught during this study. The students were divided into two different groups-one was the control group and the other was the experimental group which were at the same age and had similar levels of English. While the control group was taught target vocabulary through traditional materials like flashcards, songs and course books, the experimental group was taught the new vocabulary through authentic animated stories. During this treatment, the same pre tests, immediate post tests and delayed post tests were applied to two groups. At the end of the study, the results showed that teaching vocabulary through authentic animated stories provided a better learning of vocabulary when it was compared to teaching vocabulary through traditional materials used in EFL classrooms.",0
Speaking spontaneously: an examination of the university of cumbria approach to the teaching of modern foreign languages,"Communicative Language Teaching in the modem foreign languages (MFL) curriculum in English schools has become the norm and yet is relatively under-theorised. This thesis sets out to explore through an in-depth case study of one school, the theory and practice of a model of CLT developed by the University of Cumbria. Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) in English secondary schools typically involves pupils learning to communicate around set topics, for example 'holidays.' Activities such as role plays and listening exercises focus on this topic language. However, despite this communicative focus, studies have shown pupils lack confidence, creativity and spontaneity in speaking and interacting in the target language. Modem foreign languages lessons which employ the University of Cumbria Approach (UCA) immediately strike the observer as being different. The teacher and pupils speak the target language almost exclusively, with constant interaction in the target language. Lessons feature songs, mimes, a team competition, and competitive activities and are well-paced and dynamic. More traditional lessons may feature these, but rarely together. This study set out to identify if the UCA had a unique combination of features, through transcription and analysis of lesson observations and interviews with pupils and teachers. The most striking feature of the lessons was pupils' use of the target language: spontaneous, fluent, playful, argumentative, often not about the lesson's focus but about apparently trivial matters. Pupils clearly had things they wanted to communicate in the here and now. The first central conclusion of this study is that pupils were beginning to engage in spontaneous, unpredictable, real-time conversation in the classroom. The second main conclusion is that the teacher is key in creating the conditions for this to happen. She promotes and facilitates this conversation through management of both the target language and the creation of a communicative classroom context. Finally, it is argued that the DCA is unique in that it is a form of CLT which combines product (pupils learn the target language) with process (pupils engage in spontaneous, interactive communication). The two combine to create a rich and dynamic learning experience.",0
The effects of music activities on English pronunciation and vocabulary retention of fourth-grade ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students in Taiwan,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of music activities (singing, speech and body percussion, and instrumental performance) on the English pronunciation and vocabulary retention of fourth-grade ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students in Chia-Yi, Taiwan. The study was conducted at an elementary school. The student participants (N = 128) had to meet two criteria for participation: 1) they had to be 9 to 10 years old, and 2) they had to be learning English at the elementary school level. Students began taking English courses in the third grade at school. English examinations were administered at the beginning of each semester. Students were grouped into classes according to examination results. Cluster random sampling technique was utilized and four classrooms were randomly selected for participation in the study. Because students were grouped according to examination results, the researcher was able to work with students who had similar levels of English proficiency. Participants were divided into two groups: experimental (n = 64) and control (n = 64). The experimental group students undertook a sequence of 12 weeks of music lessons to help improve their English pronunciation and vocabulary retention. The control group was taught using a traditional method without music (e.g., text study alone).   The researcher utilized a quasi-experimental research design with pretest and posttest measurements to examine the treatment results. Results revealed that the experimental group performed significantly better on vocabulary and pronunciation posttests when compared to the control group. To provide additional evidence that music contributes to language learning, survey questionnaires were analyzed.   Based on the survey questionnaire results, the experimental group students had positive attitudes toward music activities integrated with learning English. In the language development domain, most students agreed that music activities helped them improve their English pronunciation, and they learned vocabulary words faster. In the social skills development domain, responses on the posttest questionnaire showed that most students liked learning English with classmates through music activities. In the affective development domain, 97% of the students expressed that they liked having music activities in English class. Results of this study support a conclusion that music activities improve English pronunciation and vocabulary retention among fourth-grade ESOL students.

KIDS LEARN SPANISH BY SINGING,,0
Songs and singing in foreign language learning,"Educators have claimed that listening to music in a second or foreign language (L2) can provide fun and motivating educational material and that singing can enhance the L2 learning process by improving listening and speaking skills, pronunciation, intonation, and vocabulary. Experiments have shown that under certain conditions, a sung presentation of linguistic material can facilitate verbal learning in the native language. To date, however, there is very little research evidence that singing can increase L2 skills. This thesis begins to methodically evaluate whether listening to songs and singing in a new language can facilitate L2 learning, compared to practising L2 material through more traditional, speech-based instructional methods. The research studies also explore the extent to which individual di erences (IDs) between learners may mediate any observed benefits of using songs in L2 instruction. The first two studies examine under controlled experimental conditions whether singing can support adults’ beginning-level modern language learning compared to speech over a short time period. Results indicate that when no significant group di erences exist for the ID measures, an instructional method that incorporates L2 singing can facilitate short-term learning and memory. Results also showed that IDs between learners, in particular previous language learning experience, musical abilities, mood, and motivation, can mediate the benefits of L2 learning through a singing method. The third study describes a four-week, classroom-based arts intervention exploring the e ects of incorporating songs and dramatic dialogues into the L2 curriculum, both in terms of learning outcomes and the adolescents’ opinions. In addition to increases in French skills, many children reported that the dramatic and musical activities had increased their confidence to speak in French. There was also an overall preference for listening to songs and more children reported that the songs repeated in their heads after class. The thesis concludes by discussing practical implications for L2 instruction and proposes a framework to guide future research exploring how and why singing can support modern foreign language learning.",1

The experimental reseach on self-regulated teaching and learning class model of english in senior high school,"Translation from original language as provided by authorAutonomous learning has been a buazzword in foreign language teaching since the 1980s.In recent years, autonomous learning has been a hot topic in pedagogy and psychology field. ""New curriculum standard for English teaching in China""requires teachers change the traditional teaching methods and make students improve their learning ability by adopting ""self-regulated learning"" model. Most of the researchers and educators hold the same point of view that fostering learners' autonomy is one of the most important goals on language teaching . What's the most important for a teacher is not how much knowledge he can teach the students,but how he can cultivate students to grasp the learning strategy and to develop students' ability of acquiring knowledge. In this thesis ,the author made a historical overview of the background of autonomous learning and states the present situation of learner autonomy both in the west and in China.,and then the author defines the term of autonomous learning and summarizes the factors that affect it .After that,two questionnaires are analyzed to examine the degrees and the present situation of the students' and teachers' autonomous learning and the author discovers problems in their autonomy of learning English from the students in No.1 middle school in Songyuan. The author also puts forward some strategy and measures to improve students' competence of autonomous learning according to the present situation.To better the current situation of English learning in senior middle school,the author puts forwards ""the self-accessed English teaching and learning model based on "" teaching after learning and teaching motivates learning""for senior high school English teaching.An experiment is designed and carried out on the self-access English teaching and learning model at the author's school.The result of the experiment shows that the students in the experimental class achieved greater autonomy and made greater progress in English learning during the experimental time. The study attempts to answer the following two questions: (1)Can students' ability of English autonomous learning be cultivated in senior middle school? (2)Can cultivating students' ability of English autonomous learning improve their grades in English? The findings indicate that senior high school students' ability of English autonomous learning can be cultivated and self-regulated teaching and learning model can improve students' ability of English autonomous learning and it can significantly improve their grades in",0
Using songs in efl classroom in secondary schools,"Translation from original language as provided by authorThis thesis offers a holistic analysis of the advantages and feasibility of using music and songs in EFL classroom in secondary schools. Because of lacking of the language environment, many students show low interests in English study, and the study effect is not ideal. ""The interest is the best teacher."" So how to stimulate students' study enthusiasm, the initiative and then to make the students study happily and effectively has become the focal point which the society has paid attention to. To put the unique cultural connotation and the artistic charm English songs into the classroom teaching may enable the students to obtain the esthetic joyfulness in the joyful melody, to promote the experience of the emotion, to accept the artistic infection, to strengthen the memory, to enhance the interests of studying English enormously and optimize the teaching effect. This point has been proved many times in English study linguistics. The neurologist discovered that human's left brain has the understanding language speech center, while the right brain has the corresponding music center which accepts music. When the child only learns one language, it only needs the cerebrum left hemisphere, if several kinds of languages are cultivated simultaneously to study, it begins to use the cerebrum right hemisphere; Music is sensed by the right brain, music may develop the right brain. Letting the children listen to music, study music or carry on music training to the children, may promote the children learning language efficiency greatly. Under the influence of music gradually, children's potential and the wisdom develop a lot. This provides the neurology theory basis for applying music and songs in EFL classroom. Mozart Effect Theory has proved that music and languages have cross-points in the process of development. This also provides effective psychological aspects of theoretical support for applying music and songs. in EFL classroom. This article is also based on Krashen's Affective Filter Hypothesis in the second language acquisition theory, it proposes that using music and songs in the classroom teaching can reduce the role of the learners affective filters so as to effectively improve the efficiency of the classroom. This thesis argues the feasibility of applying music and songs in EFL classroom from neurological, psychological, and cognitive linguistic angles. This thesis tries to prove the point that using music and songs in EFL classroom is not only possible for English teachers, but also beneficial for enhancement of teaching effect. The author also does an experiment in two classes in the Eleventh Secondary School in Changde City, Hunan Province. Two classes of the eighth grade instructed by the author are chosen as the controlling objects for the experiment. One is the experimental class taught with class activities incorporating music and songs, whereas the other is the contrastive class without incorporating music and songs. After one semenster experiment, experimental data are collected from students' usual performance in class, dictation results in each day, monthly tests, and two formal examinations in each term. The results are encouraging. It shows that applying music and songs in EFL classroom not only greatly increases the students' interests in learning English, but also raises their academic achievements. It is not only conducive to students' learning, but also helps teachers teach. The thesis includes four chapters. Chapter One includes a literature review of the research on this topic and the theoretical foundation of this thesis. Also the present situation of English teaching in China is analyzed. The next chapter gives a comprehensive description of the functions music and songs can fulfill in EFL classroom. The third chapter mainly deals with the selecting principles of music and songs in designing class activities and the various class activities incorporated with music and songs. As an empirical study, the last chapter gives a detailed description of the experiment held to testify the central idea of this thesis, i.e. using music and songs in EFL classroom is",1
A study of college non-english major efl teachers' viewpoints on english accents and their pronunciation teaching strategies,"Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the development of the world economy and globalization, English is mostly used among non-native speakers as a primary lingua franca (ELF) or an international language (EIL). After experiencing the three stages of Old English, Middle English and Modern English, the English language has greatly been different from its origins, with lots of local varieties appearing, some of which have been institutionalized and standardized, such as Singalish, Indian English, Nigerian English, etc. Currently, issues about English as a lingua franca or English as an international language, and English varieties have received widely concern. And the related the research has attracted more and more language researchers. In respect to English variations on the level of phonology, researches on pedagogy mostly focus on the importance of different features of pronunciation in facilitating ELF or EIL communication. Many studies have been conducted on the mutual intelligibility of different English accents. The principles of pronunciation teaching are also suggested to shift from ""nativeness"" to ""intelligibility"" by researchers and instructors. As for teaching methodology concerning intelligibility, some scholars claim the importance of exposure to different English accents, others recommend applying lingua franca core (LFC). Most of these studies are carried out in western countries but few in China. English pronunciation teaching in Chinese universities is still confined to classrooms, where students interact with other Chinese students or the teacher, which is especially true for non-English major students. In this situation, possible pronunciation problems that might threaten intelligibility are ignored, or untreated in the process of English pronunciation teaching and learning. As teachers' role is very important, it is worth examining university non-English major EFL teachers' attitudes towards different English accents and their teaching strategies. The main objectives are: to explore College non-English major EFL teachers' attitudes towards English accents, teaching goals and strategies; to reflect the current situation of pronunciation teaching in China; and to provide recommendations for pronunciation teaching according to the current problems. This thesis consists of six chapters, including: introduction, literature review, methodology, results and discussion, recommendations and conclusion. The findings mainly include: first the majority of teachers still believe that standard accents are American or British, and other accents are non-standard; second, as for the goals of English pronunciation teaching, most of teachers hold the view that the best goals are American or British accent, and English pronunciation teaching is to facilitate communication with native speakers; third, there is a positive relationship between teachers' accents and their expectation on their students'; finally, teachers' strategies are focusing more on removing the influence from students' mother tongue, instead of developing their communicative competence. Based on the findings, the author provides some recommendations for pronunciation teaching and points out some limitations of the present study as well as suggestions for further research. It is hoped that this study can contribute to the literature of English pronunciation teaching and attract researchers, and educators to be more concerned with this issue.

A conductor's introduction to the performance of modern Japanese choral music,"Currently in Japan there are 5,202 choirs registered as part of the Japan Choral Association. The majority of these choirs are amateur or professional choirs. This situation contrasts with that in the United States where colleges and universities are the primary entities perpetuating the advancement of the choral art. Most likely because of this, there is little if any academic investigation of modern Japanese choral music. Even in Japan, there is not a substantial body of academic study of this literature.  As a result, this repertoire is seldom, if ever, performed outside of Japan.     Numerous problems confront Western choral conductors interested in programming modern Japanese choral music that is based on traditional Japanese musical idioms. In this document, I have provided information that will allow Japanese choral literature to be accessible to non-Japanese speaking conductors. This information is divided into four areas. First, an overview of Japanese music history is provided. Next, a discussion of the elements of traditional Japanese music such as genre types, modes and tonalities provides the necessary background for a conductor to approach modern Japanese choral music. Third, a practical method whereby non-Japanese speaking choral conductors may transcribe the two phonetic Japanese alphabets into readable English phonetics is proposed. Fourth, a practical approach to the performance of modern Japanese choral music, inclusive of various musical genres, voicing, and instrumental complements is suggested. Discussion of representative choral works by three native composers including a work based on a folk tune, a work for women's chorus, a work for men's chorus, and a composition for mixed chorus and traditional Japanese instrumental complement provides concrete application of the aforementioned discussions.    Lastly, in this document I will provide information on several contemporary native Japanese composers, their compositions, and their publishing companies to facilitate the acquisition and performance of this rich choral repertory.",0

"Malaysian literacy practices in english: 'big books', cd-roms and the year 1 english hour","In the context of an increasing awareness of improving the standards of English in Malaysia, this study explores Year 1 literacy practices in English and offers important insights into the three major innovations introduced in 2002: the English Hour, Big Books and CD-ROMs. The findings are examined in the context of the Ministry's desire to promote active engagement and high quality interaction. Two studies were conducted using a naturalistic approach. In 2003,50 questionnaires were distributed to primary school teachers: 5 classes and 9 teachers in 2 primary and 3 pre-schools were observed teaching English, Bahasa Malaysia and Arabic/Jawi. These teachers were also interviewed. In 2004,2 trainers and 10 teachers were interviewed, 48 lessons of English, Mathematics and Science in English by the 10 teachers were observed, but the study focuses on the literacy practices in 26 lessons by 4 English teachers in four schools. Interviews and role plays with 28 children from these four classes in 7 groups of 4 inform the accounts and discussion of reading and writing events and practices. The 2004 study suggests that the Ministry of Education's directives to English classes to integrate the use of the English Hour, Big Books and CD-ROMs have only been partially implemented in the classroom. The Ministry's hopes to provide more active engagement and to increase students' interests and motivation through the Big Books and the CD-ROMs were achieved, but the expectations of high quality interaction were not realised. Methods need to be developed to accommodate teachers' beliefs about the value of drilling, repetition and choral reading with the Ministry's desire to extend these interaction patterns and practices. The present study contributes to existing research on the implementation of the English Hour, Big Books and CD-ROMs in Year 1 English classrooms, specifically from the perspective of Year 1 English classes in non-English speaking contexts. It also provides greater understanding of issues to be addressed in future teacher education developments.",0

The effectiveness of a systematic approach based on songs to prevent and correct errors in elementary core French,"The 'fossilization' of errors in French as a Second Language (FSL) learners poses a challenge to second language teachers (Lyster, 1987, 1994; Bonnar, 1992). As well, FSL teachers are faced with a lack of well researched resources created to systematically teach the correct FSL language structures (Lyster, 1987). There is also the need to connect parents to the curriculum (Stern, 1984), which, because of the nature of second language curriculum, can be particularly challenging.    The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a systematic approach based on songs to prevent and correct errors in elementary Core French.    Fifty-three students in two multi-grade classes of grades three/four and five/six completed a pretest and posttest for errors targeted in two songs in winter of the 2003-2004 school year. The pretests and posttests used the quantitative research technique of structured interviews in which the students were asked individually by the researcher to respond orally to a question prepared by the researcher using the French language  structure that was the focus of each song. The responses were coded, tabulated and summarized numerically.    Results of the study are interesting in terms of substantive significance. There was gain in achievement in both classes, for both songs, which supported both the hypothesis and the literature. However, probably due to small sample size, the results were not statistically significant. The gain in achievement is very interesting and warrants further study with a larger sample size. It is recommended that Core French teacher preparation at faculties of education, professional development for teachers on error correction and the development of appropriate, well-researched resources could help strengthen students' proficiency within the communicative approach to second language instruction of elementary Core French.",1
The evolution of the choral conducting profession in the twentieth -century: Conducting methods as written testimonies,"The document is a study of the emergence of the choral conducting profession. The different stages of this process have been tracked in the pedagogical publications designated for choral conductors or conductors in general, as well as in some additional sources on choral performance. Other sources such as biographies, recordings, choral chronicles have been excluded for the most part. The study focuses primarily on the changes in the conception of the roles and responsibilities of choral conductors. Special concern is also given to some more technical aspects such as the evolution of thought concerning the use of conducting gestures, the training of conductors, and the approach to the rehearsal. The aesthetic and vocal issues involved in choral training are not a primary concern, since they have already been investigated by other authors. The study progresses chronologically. It includes an overview of the practice of choral singing and of conducting in the nineteenth century, notably the evolution in conducting practices known as “birth of modern conducting.” The nineteenth century and the three first decades of the twentieth century were not a propitious time for the development of choral conducting. During these years, the role of choral leaders is essentially that of trainers, and their function in performance is limited. The leading movement toward the development of professional choral conducting came from Germany. In 1935 German conductor Kurt Thomas published the first choral conducting method that envisions the complete training of a choral conductor. By the 1930's, principles of modern (orchestral) conducting had been integrated into the work of choral leaders, especially through the work on unaccompanied choral repertoire. Choral trainers then became choral conductors, assuming responsibilities in interpretation and performance. The technical proficiencies for these two new roles will be refined during the years 1949–1969. By the 1970's choral conductors have achieved a full awareness of their function. The last three decades of the century correspond to a maturation of the profession: during this last period, technical means, practical working skills, and philosophical foundations of conducting are the most subject to development.",0

Korean mothers' beliefs and practices on early English education in ESL and EFL contexts,"This study examines the relationship between the beliefs and practices of mothers and children's learning experiences. By examining maternal beliefs and practices in different sociocultural contexts, the researcher identifies how the contexts of families and children's learning experiences are related. Specifically, the purpose of the study is to describe and discuss Korean mothers' beliefs and reported practices in early English education in ESL and EFL contexts. To examine Korean parents' enthusiastic attitudes toward early English education, the researcher describes their subjective beliefs and self-reported practices.    The present study is designed to employ both qualitative methodology and Q-sort methodology. To collect data, the researcher met 30 Korean mothers individually, some in Korea and some in the United States. Among them, eight mothers in Korea and eight mothers in the United States were randomly selected and interviewed. The purpose of the interviews was to elaborate on the mothers' beliefs and practices through narratives that would complement the data from the Q-sorts. Using Q-sort methodology, the researcher examined mothers' subjective beliefs concerning early English education and conducted semi-structured interviews using a standardized, open-ended strategy to describe and compare mothers' beliefs in different sociocultural contexts.    The results of this study were the following: (1) Similarities and differences exist in mothers' beliefs concerning early English education in different contexts. Mothers in both contexts showed positive beliefs concerning early English education, even though their satisfaction was higher in the EFL context. Mothers in Korea clearly showed more enthusiastic belief in direct mother-child interaction in early English education than mothers did in the United States; (2) Mothers in Korea and mothers in the United States reported different patterns of practices related to early English education at home. Mothers in Korea were more likely to hire a tutor, provide printed materials regularly, use websites to find materials, tell stories in English, and listen to audio tapes. On the other hand, mothers in the United States were more likely to read books in English, show foreign films, sing songs in English, and teach the alphabets at home. These differences in maternal practices are the result of the different contexts that they are in; (3) The beliefs of mothers in Korea can be clustered into five groups, and the beliefs of mothers in the United States can be clustered into four groups through factor analysis; (4) Mothers' demographic characteristics, such as their English proficiency and number of children, are associated with some maternal practices related to early English education, such as teaching the alphabet.    In sum, mothers' sociocultural contexts influence some of their beliefs, but not all, and their practices at home, even if they share have educational and social backgrounds. Despite their differences regarding some beliefs and reported practices, Korean mothers in ESL and EFL contexts have strong beliefs concerning early English education and they clearly value English learning through enjoyment for their young children.",0
"An investigation into attitudinal responses of years nine, ten and eleven students towards the programmes of study of the modern foreign languages national curriculum in three west essex 11-16 lm comprehensive schools","Questions which prompted interest in this area of research in 1988 Has the introduction of the National Curriculum with its concomitant statutory requirements made any measurable difference to students' responses to MFL classroom activities? If so, then in what way and to what extent might MFL study be now more (or less) appealing to more able 13-15 year-old students in local 11-16 LM Comprehensives? The last large-scale attempt to explore pupils' views on MFL classroom activities was in 1985, as part of the Assessment of Performance Unit (APU) surveys in Secondary Schools. There has been no attempt using the techniques of applied research to investigate pupils' views since the introduction of GCSE or indeed the National Curriculum. Despite this the research of Chambers, Clarke and Stables and Wikeley in the 1990s provided significant insight into the health of the subject at secondary level. Many of the concerns raised in these works are echoed in action research based in local schools in West Essex-in particular, the impact of target language teaching, the question of relevancy and the declining popularity of Languages. The research aims to record students' responses to the PoS and to find possible reasons for these constructs. The results will be compared with other findings including those of the APU from 1985. Using the Programme of Study as a means of measurement seems a worthwhile starting point. This statutory requirement of the National Curriculum forms a blueprint for MFL teaching and learning and could constitute the framework of an investigation into student responses to MFL tasks and skills. Furthermore, teachers teach increasingly by consensus. Professionals should constantly seek to exploit better the preferred learning activities of their students; if MFL staff do not know what these are they need a working model to find out this information. The research also makes use of APU questionnaires to assess the perceived enjoyment, usefulness and difficulty of MFL study as well as measuring the level of desired contact with other European students. Findings of the investigation in 2000. Many of the findings of this study may be said to report favourably on aspects of the PoS inMFL. Among the more positive responses were: • communicating with each other in pairs and groups, and with their teacher. This largely underlined the popularity of role-plays; • developing understanding and skills through a range of language activities, e.g. games, role-play, surveys and other investigations discuss their own ideas. Discuss interests and experiences and compare them with those of others. Listen, read or view for personal interest and enjoyment, as well as for information This reflected the preference of many teenagers for exercising a degree of control in the pace and direction of the tasks set; • listening and responding to different types of spoken language. Skimming and scanning texts, including databases where appropriate, for information. This suggests that such exercises are popular for reasons that are likely to be related to pace of work; • using a range of resources for communicating, e.g. telephone, electronic mail, fax, letters; • redrafting writing to improve its accuracy and presentation, e.g. by wordprocessing. Using dictionaries and reference materials. Students are not always comfortable with the seemingly random nature of language and welcome quick methods of eliminating doubt and establishing accuracy; • Express agreement, disagreement, personal feeling and opinions. Learning by heart phrases and short extracts, e.g. rhymes, poems, songs, jokes, tongue twisters. Pupils enjoy such activities but are critical when the material is unappealing. However, many of the findings indicated less positive experiences of the students in MFL. These included: • A significantly low level of perceived enjoyment in MFL study among average and more able students in all three schools in the study falling from an already \O\,v base in Year 9 to lower levels in Year 10 and Year 11; • This experience is often more pronounced in MFL than in other GCSE subjects; • A reluctance to use the target language as a means of communication. Elements of the PoS most strongly connected to this finding were: using language for real purposes, as well as to practise skills, using everyday classroom events as a context for spontaneous speech, initiating and developing conversations, developing strategies for dealing with the unpredictable, producing a variety of types of writing, asking about meanings, seek clarification or repetition in the TL. • Teachers do not always accurately assess the popularity or unpopularity of MFL classroom tasks; • Definitions of difficulty are often determined by levels of motivation; • The desire for contact with the target language community is minimal and there are low levels of integrative motivation in all three schools; • Ethnocentricity does not appear to contribute to this; • Comparisons with 1985 APU findings indicate a far more negative outlook for MFL study in some West Essex schools with virtually no interest in post 16 MFL study.",0

An analysis of teachers' perceptions of the efficacy of an instructional method for English language development using music and singing paired with movement,"The purpose of this study was to analyze teachers' perceptions of the efficacy of an instructional method entitled P.L.A.Y.™ (Physical Learning Activities for Youngsters). This program is designed for beginning ELLs. The premise of this study is to advance the concept of using music and singing paired with movement as a means for English language acquisition. This study supports research that states that English language development can be readily acquired when it is made comprehensible. In this case when it is presented through music, singing and physical actions.    The study used four research questions to focus the data collection: (1) What are participating teachers' ratings of the P.L.A.Y. program's correspondence with the key components of effective second language models? (2) What are participating teachers' ratings of the P.L.A.Y. program's correspondence with the key components of effective SDAIE strategies? (3) What are the participating teachers' ratings of the P.L.A.Y. program's correspondence with California's Beginning Proficiency Level of the ELD Standards? and (4) What are the participating teachers' believed strengths and weaknesses of the P.L.A.Y. staff development model?    The study was conducted at five elementary schools in Southern California selected based on the following criteria: (a) the student body is ethnically diverse consisting of at least 40% second language learners; (b) the schools are identified as recipients of Title I/Title VII funding; (c) the kindergarten—second grade teachers have been involved in extensive staff development training in the P.L.A.Y. program. The participants in this study include kindergarten—second grade teachers assigned to Alternative and/or SEI classrooms. All teachers were asked to complete a written questionnaire. Embedded in the survey was a three-question self-report. One teacher from each school site and the five school principals were interviewed using interview guides designed to obtain data pertaining to the research questions.    The data indicated that the participating teachers believe that the P.L.A.Y. program corresponds to effective second language acquisition models, provides practical ELD and SDAIE strategies and encompasses a successful staff development model.",0

"The effects of rhythm, music, song, and chant in the Korean English language classroom","This study investigates rhythm, music, song, and chant as instructional strategies with Korean students for improving their listening and speaking in English. The sound system of English is so unlike Korean that Korean students encounter a multitude of phonological problems. Many foreign language teachers in Korea continue to emphasize grammatical analysis as the primary instructional strategy.    The essence of this document is to expand and refine theoretical constructs of second language pedagogy to assist those persons involved with language acquisition in Korea as well as any other English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs where the musical strategies may be applied.    This researcher traces the development of second language theory and methodology by way of a historical essay. In addition, a case study report shows classroom applications and procedural instructions. The commentaries from students in the study, as noted, and the author's reflections support the effectiveness of a musical medium in the second language instructional environment.    To provide additional evidence for the efficacy the instructional strategies, a treatment-control research design was carried out at two universities South Korea. The subjects were studying English and one group received the musical treatment. Results of the pre and posttest showed gain scores of the treatment group to be consistently higher than the control group. Intervening variables made it difficult to establish a direct causal link; thus, further research is recommended.    The author wants to encourage and contribute to subsequent investigations of this nature. Therefore, the study includes guides for a proposed syllabus, materials selection, staff development, and lesson planning.",0
The role of the musicality of language in the acquisition process of English as a second language,"Researchers from different fields such as musicology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology or neurobiology confirm the existence of shared elements between music and language. In applied linguistics, a good number of teacher discourse studies identify exaggerated pronounciation and voice inflections as universal features of this type of register. In this book, the musicality present in English L2 teacher discourse has been analysed. The melodic contours found were isolated and described from a musical-linguistic perspective. Similarities between L1 and L2 acquisition processes have been widely discussed in literature. Exaggerated melodic contours have also been found in adult-directed-to-infant-speech. They are considered as a parental intuitive use to guide their babies' musical beginnings, but they are also seen as a species-specific learning guidance towards language. In this book, as regards to the musical character of language, a parallelism between adult-directed-to-infant-speech and teacher discourse has been established. Therefore, Spanish and English teachers teaching English have been recorded and their discourse has been analysed. Further more, an experimental study was designed as the existing studies on music and language learning reported in L2 acquisition literature do not offer enough information to differentiate if working with music or musicality has a facilitating effect in language acquisition. Finally, this book concludes that working with the musicality of speech, that is to say, with shared elements between language and music, such as rhythm, length, pauses or melodic contours has a positive effect on EFL students language acquisition process.",0
"Speech, songs, and intermediate vocalizations: A longitudinal study of preschool children's vocal development","The present study is a qualitative and quantitative interdisciplinary investigation of young children's vocal development. It investigated how vocalizations of young children mutate in relation to the children's linguistic and musical development, and the contexts in which these developments take place.    Eight girls age eighteen to thirty-eight months participated in this study. Four spoke Chinese and four spoke English as their first language. Each child was visited every four to six months over a 42 month period. Acoustic analyses were performed on recorded vocal responses, and three judges classified the vocalizations and provided perceptual evaluation.    It appears that young children have established communicative pitches that are associated with different forms of vocalizations by age two. All children consistently sang with higher fundamental frequencies than they used for speaking, while other forms of vocalization appear to be positioned consistently between singing and speaking.    Both the mean fundamental frequency data and the qualitative data suggest some possible differences in vocal pitch behaviours across language. Chinese bilingual children made comparatively less but stable distinction between their speech and song; in their acoustic intermediate vocalizations  however, the boundary between speech and song was “fuzzy”. English monolingual children made increasingly clearer and wider acoustical distinctions between their speech and songs; their contextual intermediate vocalizations were made up of intermittent singing and speaking.    The intermediate vocalizations observed in the present study appear to confirm that singing and speaking are two vocal phenomena that exist along a continuum. They call into question the entire concept of differences between singing and speaking both acoustically and contextually. These intermediate vocalizations offer a rich account of the linguistic and musical development of a child; they suggest that while first spoken language appears to affect vocal development, a child's non-speech auditory environment is also crucial to the understanding of her vocal behaviours.",0

"""Hello Mrs. Scribbles"": Storytelling, identity and teacher research in the kindergarten","Using the framework of critical ethnography, one that offers an insider's view to understanding processes, I entered my own kindergarten classroom and tried to place my own storytelling pedagogy under critical scrutiny. I tried to find answers to such questions as: (1) what impact my storytelling praxis had on the identity of the children, (2) how my teacher belief about storytelling and literacy learning of young children informed my classroom praxis and (3) how the children responded to this praxis.    This research was conducted over ten weeks in 1994 in a small English speaking school in a mid-sized city in central Canada. Forty-two children took part in the study; twenty-five were five years old and seventeen were four years old. Twenty-six of the children were English speaking. Sixteen children were from ethnically diverse backgrounds.    Each week I told the children one story, taken from my annual ""Fairy Tale and Nursery Rhyme"" theme. I taperecorded these tellings and demonstrated the use of the taperecorder for the children. The taperecorder was then made available to the children and they were encouraged to go and tell their own stories into it. During this time I also collected field notes and kept a reflective journal.    An analysis of the data revealed a storytelling praxis rife with problems. The themes of the teacher-told stories offered a very narrow Eurocentric world view. Most child storytellers were five years old and had strong English skills. Four year old children or children with weak English skills tended to stay away from the taperecorder. Finally, while acting as both a teacher and a researcher is a creative means of bringing the classroom teacher's voice into the literature, it proved to be full of tension.

Native Chinese-speaking children's acquisition of performance-based and reflective word knowledge in English,"The foci of this study were to compare the processes of acquiring concept of word (i.e., performance-based and reflective word knowledge) in English between native English- and Chinese-speaking children and to identify the significant factors influencing the acquisition. A multiple case study design was used for this study. The six participants were enrolled in English-only kindergarten classrooms and were involved in this study for approximately six months. At the beginning and end of this study, the participants were assessed on their Chinese language proficiency and the five tasks for performance-based and reflective word knowledge.    The data sources included (a) transcribed parent and teacher interviews as well as informal talks, (b) fieldnotes from 10 classroom observations, and (c) participants' performance on the assessment tasks. The constant comparison method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) was employed to analyze the data. Coding and recoding of collected data were ongoing along with data collection (Miles & Huberman, 1994) until data saturation was reached (Bogdan & Biklen, 1992).    The data revealed that the six participants shared similar developmental patterns in their acquisition of performance-based and reflective word knowledge in English. A distinct difference was the participants' difficulty with memorizing the lines of a nursery rhyme. The participants' limited Chinese literacy experience seemingly had little impact on their development of word knowledge in English. Each participant's home and school literacy support were two significant factors that influenced acquisition of word knowledge in English. The parents of the participants made efforts to provide them with literacy support. Some classrooms promoted participants' oral language development or nurtured their love for reading, while others had only a limited number of learning activities that involved them. There were virtually no authentic writing opportunities in any classroom for the participants to explore a connection between spoken and written language and word boundaries.    This study called for further research with a larger number of participants in diverse classrooms for a longer period of time. Additionally, it suggested the possibility of examining the role of TV programs in native Chinese-speaking children's early English literacy development.",0
Songs in the L2 syllabus: Integrating the study of Russian language and culture,"This study explores the benefits of including song in the foreign language (FL) syllabus. Systematic inclusion of songs into the foreign language syllabus successfully integrates the study of the target language (L2) and the target culture (C2) and provides a framework for the development of language skills within an authentic cultural context. Songs (as authentic oral and written texts) allow foreign language learners at all levels of proficiency the opportunity to develop language skills in all modalities and learn strategies to improve listening and reading comprehension. Song has the additional benefit of making language study more enjoyable and less threatening to some learners, thus lowering the affective filter and perhaps increasing motivation for foreign language study. It is also highly probable that song (given its rhythmic, repetitive and melodic qualities) acts as a mnemonic device, thus assisting the learner with acquisition of vocabulary and grammatical structures. Inclusion of music in the foreign language syllabus appeals to bimodal instruction and generative theories of music and linguistics. Music is also a probable factor in the Din phenomenon, a possible sign of language acquisition.    This study provides a thorough review of literature in relevant fields: reading and listening in a foreign language, culture learning, parallels between music and language, music in the foreign language classroom, the affective domain, motivation, social distance, and the Din phenomenon. This study also provides a comprehensive syllabus of Russian songs (including folk, Romany, art, contemporary, pop and rock songs) for first-year students (0-150 hours of post-secondary classroom instruction), second-year students (151-400 hours of post-secondary classroom instruction), and third-year students and above (410 or more hours of post-secondary classroom instruction). Cultural notes and language activities (in all modalities) appropriate for each level of study accompany the songs and act as a medium to integrate the target culture into the foreign language syllabus.",0
Education language policy and bilingual education: The impact of French language policy in primary education in Niger,"The study analyses language policies and their effects on pupils' academic achievement in two types of primary education programs in Niger. A Hausa and French bilingual school, called Ecole Experimentale, and a French monolingual school called Ecole Lazaret Deux. The study uses the bilingual proficiency framework developed by Cummins (1979) and McNab's (1989) education language planning model to analyze, respectively, the students' performance on selected language tasks (dictation, composition and reading comprehension) and content area tests (mathematics, social studies) tests administered in French and the sociolinguistic situation in Niger in general and in the schools in particular.    The research findings show that language policy advocating the use of mother tongue (in this case Hausa) in primary education is not detrimental to pupils' French learning and their academic performance in language. They also indicate that in the case of primary education in Niger, longer exposure to instruction in French does not trigger appropriate proficiency in it. Both schools' pupils performed poorly on the achievement and proficiency tests administered during the experiment. That result suggests that there are serious problems related to the teaching and testing methods utilize currently in the Nigerian education system.    The sociolinguistic analysis indicates that at the advent of its political independence and up to now, Niger has mostly continued its colonial language policy both in education and administration by maintaining French as the exclusive media in formal domains (education and administration). In non-formal education (literacy and adult education), five national languages (Hausa, Zarma-Sonrai, Fulfulde, Kanuri and Tamajeq) are used as means of instruction. In formal education, these national languages have been used in only 40 schools for an experiment which has begun in 1973. The positive report on the experiment and the various recommendations from scholars and the national education conferences have not materialized in a language policy which advocates the use of national languages in at least the primary education system.    Using our research findings and taking into account Niger' sociopolitical profile and its organizational context, we recommend a careful implementation of a bilingual education program which advocates the use of regional languages (Hausa, Zarma-Songhai, Fulfulde, Kanuri and Tamajeq) along with French in primary education. The regional languages must serve first as means of instruction from first up to fourth grade, while French is taught as a subject; and in fifth and sixth grade French must become the language of instruction and the regional languages must be taught as subjects. The promotion of French and national languages throughout the primary education system is argued to be more advantageous pedagogically than a transitional bilingual education program which ends the use of mother tongue in the child's education. It is suggested that such proposal be implemented progressively while the extensive teacher training and language development activities are undertaken by government and private institutions which are in favor of the use of national languages in education and the finding of long-term solutions to the education language problems in Niger.",0
"Spanish translation of Johann Joachim Quantz's ""Essai d'une methode pour apprendre a jouer de la flute traversiere""","Johann Joachim Quantz's 1752 Versuch einer Anweisung die Flote traversiere zu spilen (Essay of a Method to Learn to Play the Transverse Flute) is one of the most cited primary sources for music performance practice during the first half of the eighteenth-century. In addition to the mechanics of playing the instrument, the work contains copious advice for singers, accompanists, soloists, and instrumentalists. It also treats at length matters of great interest to all musicians, such as good and bad expression and execution, ornamentation, trills, cadenzas, how to play Adagio and Allegro movements, ensemble layout, the duties of the leader and of the members of an orchestra, how to judge musical compositions, performers and performances, opera, regional styles and the so called ""mixed style."" The Versuch truly constitutes a window to the musical ""bon gout"" of the first half of the eighteenth century. J. J. Quantz had his work translated into French for its use in other nations and published both versions simultaneously.    There are translations of the Versuch into Dutch, Italian, English and Japanese. An extensive search of published sources did not locate any Spanish translation of this work thereby determining that it was in essence unavailable. A complete Spanish translation of J. J. Quantz's French version Essai d'une methode pour apprendre a jouer de la flute traversiere is provided. The main purpose of undertaking this project was to make available this essential primary source to Spanish speaking performers and students of eighteenth-century music who otherwise may not have access to the original or any of its translations. This translator has made an effort to convey the meaning of the text clearly and to deliver it in straightforward modern Spanish, avoiding an archaic style which would detract from the comprehension of the text and would only be artificial. All musical examples that in the original were appended at the end of the book, have been inserted within the text after each appropriate reference. Biographical information on J. J. Quantz, literature review, methodology for the project and a discussion of the applicability of the teachings of this work precede the translation.",0
The anthems of Herbert Howells (1892-1983),"Herbert Howells's religious choral works are generally regarded as his primary contribution to the twentieth-century English music repertoire. According to Peter John Hodgson, Howells's most representative achievements are found among the numerous settings of the canticles for various ecclesiastical establishments, among a quantity of anthems and motets, and among the several large-scale works for chorus, soloists and orchestra'. While studies of his canticles and at least one large-scale choral work have recently been completed, there has been no comprehensive investigation of the anthems and motets. The present thesis is a detailed, historical and analytical study of Howells's anthems and motets.    This study is primarily intended for choral directors who seek to expand their knowledge about Howells and his anthems. Early chapters include: a short biography based on current research; a consideration of the composer within the context of English music history, particularly the so-called English Musical Renaissance; and a survey of Howells's total compositional outgut, with special emphasis given to his choral music.    Furthermore, an extensive, analytical investigation of Howells's anthems is presented. The author broadly defines the anthem as a choral composition, in English or Latin, with or without accompaniment, that may be sung as part of a Christian service. Both textual and musical matters are considered in the analysis of Howells's works. It was found that the composer typically employed liturgical, biblical and literary texts of high quality. Two primary textual tones--the elegiac and the ecstatic--emerge as predominant determinants of musical mood. Also discussed are elements of the 'Howells sound': particularly the composer's unique blending of tonality and modality; his adeptness at setting texts and creating musical mood; and his development of a very personal 'impressionistic polyphonic style' in which he skillfully manipulates both melodic and harmonic materials.    The appendix consists of an outline of Howells's life within the context of contemporary English musical events and a catalogue which is particularly useful in assisting the conductor choose pieces appropriate to certain church services and concert programs. An extensive bibliography concludes the study.",0
Effect of music instruction on language development of preschool children,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a sequential program of music instruction on language development, both receptive and expressive language, of preschool children. Subjects were thirty-three three- and four-year-old children from two preschools in the Nashville, Tennessee, area.    Subjects in both intact classes in the study were pretested for receptive language skills using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) form L and for expressive language skills by the collection of tape-recorded language samples. Following the pretest, one group received planned music instruction by a certified music teacher twice a week over a three month period. The other group received no treatment. At the conclusion of the period of instruction, the PPVT-R, form M was administered to all subjects as a posttest for receptive language, and a second language sample was recorded for expressive language.    Results of the study indicated that language development of preschool children was not influenced by music instruction. The lack of random selection of the treatment site may have influenced the outcome of the research by providing a more supportive environment. The likelihood is, however, that the primary influence in the outcome of the study was the small sample size which resulted in a lack of statistical power. Whether the outcome was due to small sample size or to the absence of any effect of music instruction on language development was not determined. The study provided a foundational data base for future large sample research investigating the effects of a sequential program of music instruction on the language development of preschool children.",1
"Teaching new dialect forms: Effects of text exposure, transformation strategies and guided practice","A social-cognitive view of self-regulated learning guided the design of instruction to strengthen students' written syntactic competence with dialect forms of English different from their spoken dialects. Instruction consisted of three components taught singly or in combination: (1) exposure to text (E); (2) exposure to text plus instruction in dialect transformation strategies (ES); (3) exposure to text, dialect transformation strategies, plus guided practice and feedback in the use of such strategies (ESP). Instructional effects were examined in two populations: masters level teacher education students and Black English Vernacular (BEV) speaking elementary school students. Teachers were taught to write using BEV syntax. Elementary students were taught to write using Standard English (SE).    Treatment effects on teacher education students were evaluated on three outcome measures: knowledge of BEV, attitude towards BEV, and opinion about teacher response to BEV use in the classroom. Results showed that the ESP group acquired greater knowledge of BEV syntax than the E or ES groups. All groups showed significant positive attitude shifts towards BEV. Differences between treatment conditions were not significant. ESP trained teachers claimed they would not correct dialect-based reading and writing miscues and, when making corrections, they would have students attempt to self-correct. These claims were less common among E or ES subjects, although differences fell short of statistical significance.    Treatment effect on BEV speaking elementary students were evaluated for acquisition of written SE syntax and for self-efficacy perceptions regarding ability to use correct SE syntax when writing. Results showed that ESP students acquired greater proficiency in the use of targeted SE syntactic forms than did E or ES students. Pretest self-efficacy ratings were quite high, averaging 71% despite pretest SE proficiency scores of only 32%. In contrast to E and ES subjects, ESP subjects showed significant decreases in self-efficacy ratings following instruction. The shift to more realistic perceptions by ESP students is regarded as an important step in the self-regulation process.    Results carry implications for educating and sensitizing SE speaking classroom teachers about the use of nonstandard dialect forms by their students and helping dialect-speaking students acquire proficiency in written SE syntax.",0
The development and growth of choral music in Taiwan (1624-1994),"Western choral singing first appeared in Taiwan in the seventeenth century under the influence of the Dutch. Later, during the nineteenth century, the English and Canadian Presbyterian missionaries were responsible for the further development and encouragement of church choral activities. Choral singing, and subsequently choral composing, developed gradually over time under all types of political and social circumstances. Today, all aspects of choral music play an important role in the cultural life of Taiwan. Evidence of this phenomenon can be seen in the establishment of significant music departments and choral organizations, together with the emergence of an increasing number of composers and musical conferences. Contemporary Taiwanese composers, trained in twentieth-century techniques in Europe and the United States, are composing more radical, lengthy, and well-orchestrated choral works. Consequently, a synthesis of traditional and western musical elements worthy of being called Taiwanese ""new music"" has emerged.    The primary objectives of this treatise are: first, to present the history and examples of Highland aboriginal tribal songs with multi-voiced character--songs that have existed for five thousand years and serve as a valuable part of Taiwan's cultural heritage as well as an enormous resource for Taiwanese composers of today; second, to investigate the emergence and later development of Taiwanese choral music exposed to western influences; third, to analyze nine specific choral compositions of nine representative Taiwanese composers. These selected compositions incorporate musical styles that are a direct result of the evolution and history of choral music in Taiwan. Five of these nine pieces are transcribed for performance purposes by the author and appear in the appendix of the treatise.    A video taped lecture and performance of the choral music presented and discussed in this treatise is available upon request from the author. The purpose of the video tape is to serve as a teaching and performance aid for non-Chinese speaking singers and conductors who have an interest in performing authentic Chinese choral literature.",0
"Hermann Suter's oratorio ""Le Laudi di San Francesco d'Assisi"": A reflection of Swiss musical life in the early twentieth century","Hermann Suter's oratorio Le Laudi di San Francesco d'Assisi is a work of about seventy-minutes' duration for soloists, mixed chorus, children's chorus, orchestra, and organ. Its text, by St. Francis of Assisi, is the Canticle of the Creatures, in which each element of creation is personified. Suter sets the text in a series of nine movements, each expressing the characteristics of a particular element. Thus, Brother Fire is described in a vigorous triple-fugue with flame-like string figuration, and Sister Moon and the stars by string harmonics, harp, and celeste.    Hermann Suter (1870-1926) studied in Basel, Stuttgart, and Leipzig, under Reinecke. As conductor of the Musikgesellschaft, (Symphony Society) the Gesangverein, and the Liedertafel, he shaped the musical life of the city of Basel for the first quarter of the twentieth century. His style is late-romantic, a synthesis of German counterpoint and Italianate lyricism, with Gregorian motives used in the oratorio.    The oratorio, written in 1923, was enthusiastically received, and quickly heard throughout Europe and in New York. Yet today it remains virtually unknown outside Switzerland, the only place where it is still performed regularly.    In Chapter One, Suter's life and career are outlined. In Chapter Two, I survey the tradition of choral music in Switzerland, and the repertory of choral works most often performed there. In the third chapter, the history of the cult of St. Francis is examined, and music relating to the Saint is described. Chapter Four is devoted to the text of the Canticle, the starting point for Suter's compositional decisions. Chapter Five, an overview of the oratorio, examines the formal design, orchestration, vocal writing, and other musical elements. In Chapter Six, the oratorio is examined movement by movement. Chapter Seven presents the reception history of the piece, reviews, and conclusions.    By examining the oratorio Le Laudi and its context, we discover an unjustly neglected choral work and are offered a glimpse of musical life in Switzerland in the early years of this century. I hope in this thesis to introduce the oratorio to English-speaking readers and to generate some interest in it among choral musicians.",0
Teacher use of and beliefs about media in the ESL elementary school classrooms of Texas,"Elementary school teachers use a variety of media to expedite the English language learning of their ESL students. This study focuses on how they use it, and how their media use relates to their beliefs about teaching and learning ESL.    I conducted a state-wide survey about teachers' use of media and also four case studies of elementary school ESL teachers in Texas. The statewide survey was distributed to 183 school districts. Four mailings secured 107 responses (56.6% return rate). The state-wide survey showed that tape recorders, VCRs, computers and overhead projectors are the most frequently used media. The least frequently used media are radios, laser discs, slides, and telephones. The most popular combination of media and activity was the tape recorder used for rhymes or songs. Teachers cited sensory mode and social preference as the two main considerations in media use.    Four case studies of elementary school ESL teachers generated data about teaching ESL, using media, and teacher beliefs and the sources that influence them. An adaptation of Kelly's (1955) Repertory Grid technique indicated that teachers' criteria for making decisions fell into five possible categories: (1) behavior management; (2) student work; (3) teacher planning; (4) ESL and BE; and (5) media use. Other interviews revealed various ways of using media: one teacher carefully chose media to supplement her lessons; two teachers allowed the content of the media to direct their planning and teaching; and the fourth teacher unsuccessfully imposed computers on her students.    The four teachers cited three main influences on their beliefs and decisions: (1) assumptions about the parents of their students; (2) information from workshops, professional journals and educational televised broadcasts; and (3) information about students such as grades or degree of computer proficiency. The teachers addressed ESL in different ways: two of the four teachers taught ESL across the day (having phased out a separate ESL period after the first two months of the school year); the third teacher never had a separate ESL class; the fourth teacher taught solely in Spanish, assuming that her students would learn English outside of the classroom.* ftn*Originally published in DAI vol. 56, no. 10.

The effect of the incorporation of music learning into the second language classroom on the mutual reinforcement of music and language,"The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the incorporation of a music program in the second-language classroom, with methodology based on similarities that exist between the structures of music and language, reinforced both the learning of music and the learning of a second language.    Fifty-three subjects from two Grade 2 French immersion classes from one elementary school of the Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, area were chosen to represent the control (n = 26) and experimental (n = 27) groups of this study. Eight weekly units of five 15-minute music lessons totally incorporated to the French second-language class were planned and taught by the experimental group's regular classroom teacher. The general objective of the devised program was to help children gain the music concepts of tonal-rhythmic pattern and form that have commonalities with pronunciation, oral grammar, vocabulary and reading comprehension. The control group received the regular oral-visual drill-type French lessons, and the regular 30 minutes a week of music taught by the music specialist. It was hypothesized that the incorporation of a music program into the French immersion classroom would reinforce both music and second-language learning.    Criterion referenced tests were devised to measure the dependent variables. All music and French tests were administered as pre- and posttests. Academic achievement was also measured and considered as a variable that may have an effect on language and music achievement.    Data were subjected to a series of ANOVA and ANCOVA statistical designs. Results indicated that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in all music tests and in the oral grammar and reading comprehension French tests.",1
Theoretical perspectives. C'est sympa! Le Francais pour primaire: Content-based second language instruction,"As a significant original contribution to second language instruction, this Project Demonstrating Excellence has integrated present state-of-the-art second language theory into the development of an extensive language program compiled in the form of teaching modules. The modules utilize workable concepts of content-based instruction, purposeful teaching of culture, and developmentally-appropriate strategies to integrate context and activities to teach French at the elementary level. Incorporation of songs designed to teach targeted language heighten the originality and creativity of the program. It is the author's opinion that the benefits of teaching whole or content-based language and relevant culture experientially and interactively are vital to the language acquisition process. Research conducted in the field of study directed the following questions to be resolved and implemented in the development of suitable teaching materials. How does one create and implement content-based instruction appropriate to teaching FLES$\sp\*$ (Foreign Language in Elementary Schools) in the regular second language classroom programs at the elementary level? How can this process be applied to the experiential language learning of students? Is it effective within this framework? This document gives the rational behind using the strategies, techniques, activities and materials presented in the teaching modules. It identifies essential applied concepts such as cognitive and developmental psychology, historical development of the teaching of second languages at the elementary level, language theories and methodologies, content-based instruction, teaching for cultural understanding, art and music techniques and theory, and the preparation of suitable teaching modules using desktop publishing and numerous other computer software applications. This Doctoral Program provided a cyclic process for intergrating research, development, testing, evaluating and adjusting of the final product. The Internship was designed to provide an opportunity for observing children learning a second language experientially, field-testing and evaluating the materials developed in the PDE.",0
"The effects of music field trips in a high school music appreciation curriculum on cognitive music learning, including language acquisition and music attitudes","The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of field trips in a high school music appreciation curriculum on cognitive music learning including language acquisition and music attitudes, with an emphasis on ESL/LEP students who were mainstreamed into the classes. Subjects were 128 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students in a metropolitan inner city school enrolled in music appreciation classes for one semester who were divided into experimental (with music field trips) and control (the same curriculum without music field trips) groups; groups were approximately matched; the study spanned two semesters for 2 years. Instruments for this quasi-experimental study were Zorn's Music Appreciation Inventory and Music Interest Inventory amended as pretest and posttest. A pilot study indicated the need for a change in timing the posttesting. For analysis with NOVA, the groups were subdivided into non-ESL/LEP and ESL/LEP. It was hypothesized that there would be no difference on either of the test instruments between those participating in the field trips and those not participating even with the students categorized as ESL/LEP. An interrelated research question highlights the issue of whether or not music field trips provide a speech environment conducive to second language acquisition. The research lends credence to the belief that language can become more comprehensible to second language learners in an environment offering a low affective filter and comprehensible input which is often found in music classes, particularly when students participate in activities such as educational music field trips. No significant difference was found in the pretest and posttest scores of non-ESL students in either the control group or the experimental group. Positive effects were evidenced in students who experienced the music field trips, particularly the ESL students who were mainstreamed into the classes. ESL/LEP students who received the field trip treatment made gains in the MII, whereas the scores on the MII of the ESL students who did not attend the field trips were lower.",0
An investigation of the existence and generic nature of effective teaching behaviors as related to elementary grade-level and secondary subject matter areas,"The purpose of this study was to examine the existence and generic nature of 50 effective teaching behaviors contained in ""An Instructive Tool For Improving Teaching"" (Zales & Langlois 1989). The primary research question sought to determine if differences existed between the percent of elementary and secondary teachers who exhibited these behaviors. The subsidiary questions asked what percent of teachers, at each elementary level and secondary subject matter area, exhibited each behavior. There were seven elementary levels (K-6) and eleven secondary subject matter areas (Art, Business, English, Foreign Languages, Health/Physical Education, Home Economics, Industrial Arts, Mathematics, Music, Science, and Social Studies).    Data for this descriptive study were obtained from 49 administrators who completed questionnaires on a stratified random sample of 225 teachers. The administrators indicated for individual teachers if each behavior had been exhibited. Judgment was to be primarily based on classroom observations of that teacher.    For the primary research question, a Chi-square test at the.05 level of significance was performed for each behavior. Significantly more elementary than secondary teachers exhibited the behaviors of (a) participating in professional development activities and (b) adapting to individual needs of students. Significantly more secondary than elementary teachers exhibited the behavior of having short and long range objectives. No other significant differences were found. In answering the subsidiary questions, results ranged from 33.3% to 100%, with 80% to 100% of the teachers in most groups exhibiting each behavior.    The major conclusions of this study are: (1) With very few exceptions the 50 behaviors are generic with respect to elementary and secondary level and existent in each of the seven elementary and eleven secondary groups. (2) Grade One, Foreign Language, and Mathematics teachers exhibited more behaviors at a higher rate than did other teacher groups. (3) Grade Six and Physical Education/Health teachers exhibited more behaviors at a lower rate than did other teacher groups. (4) Though exhibited by at least one-half of the teachers, behaviors dealing with lesson closure, individualization, higher order thinking skills, and obtaining background student information were exhibited at a relatively low rate.",0
"Learning to be German: Primary schooling in Alsace-Lorraine, 1870-1918","After the Franco-Prussian War, Germany attempted to integrate the formerly French province of Alsace-Lorraine by reforming primary schools. Borrowing models from Prussia and other German states, German officials imposed a primary school system designed to teach local children the language, culture, geography, and history of Germany. As adults, these children were supposed to become loyal subjects of the German Empire.    Varied archival and library materials--including unpublished statistics, administrative correspondence, inspectors' reports and published laws, decrees, textbooks, teachers' manuals, memoirs, pedagogical journals, and provincial assembly debates--are the sources for the study.    By compromising with local notables, including the Catholic clergy, German administrators avoided political struggles in the establishment of German schools. Within the schools themselves, the content of instruction remained largely religious and regional. By avoiding political conflict and by coupling national with regional and religious instruction, German administrators managed to legitimate subtly the national content of primary school education.    German school policy had, for the most part, the desired effect of teaching the German language, German culture, and even loyalty to the German state. Students from across the province, even from French-speaking families in isolated rural areas, spoke and wrote acceptable German by 1900. Like other German children, pupils in Alsace-Lorraine memorized songs about the emperor and the German fatherland as well as traditional religious songs. They recited their geography and history lessons about Alsace-Lorraine and its place in the empire. Scattered evidence reveals that by 1914 the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine came to see themselves as German.    Introductory and concluding chapters consider French schooling in Alsace-Lorraine before 1870 and after 1918, lending a comparative perspective. Whatever the national rivalries between France and Germany, the two nations used strikingly similar methods to encourage Alsace-Lorrainers' loyalty to the nation-state.",0
"A study of the choral music tradition in Hungarian Baptist churches: Its history, leadership, literature, personnel, and practice, including an anthology of representative choral works","Hungarian Baptists have developed a strong tradition of artistic choral singing which is supported by widespread congregational involvement in the choirs, an ecumenical body of choral publications that constitutes a primary source for church choirs in post-World War II Hungary, and an effective system for training church members--particularly the youths--in musical pursuits. This significant choral practice is almost unknown outside of Hungary, and information about it is not readily available.    During 1991, the author conducted research in Hungary, collecting data through methods that included observation, participation, acquisition of documents, and interviews. He was assisted by, among others, Pal Beharka (b. 1929), Hungarian Baptists' most prominent church music leader, and Istvan Kovacs, Director of the Baptist Youth Chorus.    Chapter 1 presents a historical overview of the Baptist presence in Hungary. It includes discussions of the Anabaptists (Baptists' theological predecessors), the nineteenth-century German missionary activity spearheaded by Heinrich Meyer (1842-1919), and major twentieth-century developments.    Chapter 2 constitutes a historical overview of Hungarian Baptist church music from 1873 until the present. It examines primary leaders, publications, trends, and socio-political contexts.    Chapter 3 presents biographical information regarding contemporary Hungarian Baptist music leaders. In addition to Beharka, Istvan Jobbagy, Gabor Lisznyay, Gabor Olah, and Kovacs are included.    Chapter 4 examines the Baptist choral anthologies, Hungarian Baptists' primary sources of choral music. It includes discussions of the books' histories, editors, contents, and contributors--many of whom are major Hungarian church music composers.    Chapter 5 is a description of Hungarian Baptist choirs, examining their sizes, personnel, rehearsal procedures, leadership, performance characteristics, and role in worship. It also includes discussions of the Baptist Central Choir and the Baptist Youth Chorus. Chapter 6 describes the Summer Course, an annual two-week music school which constitutes Baptists' primary vehicle for training their music leadership.    Appendices include descriptions of the contents of the choral anthologies categorized by various criteria, lists of works by major Hungarian church music composers found exclusively in Hungarian Baptist publications, and Hungarian Baptist church music program data.",0
The effect of a musical medium on the vocabulary acquisition of limited English speakers,"The main purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which music could facilitate the acquisition of a second language. Subjects consisted of 48 second grade limited English-proficient children. A Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design with Matching and Repeated measures was selected for this investigation. The dependent variable, vocabulary acquisition, was measured using a testing instrument which was patterned after that created by Elley (1989). The two independent variables under investigation consisted of (1) Medium (Music/No Music) and (2) Extralinguistic Support (Illustration/No Illustration). These were crossed to produce four treatment conditions. Prior to being randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups, equivalent groups were formed by matching subjects on the basis of their pretest scores. Subjects belonging to the No Music group listened to a tape-recorded oral story while Music group subjects listened to a sung version of the same story. Illustration groups were shown large colorful pictures which contained the targeted vocabulary words. Treatment extended over a four day period. During this time, subjects heard the story played consecutively three times. Posttesting occurred at the end of the treatment period, then one and one-half weeks later.    Analyses of variance were performed of initial and retained vocabulary gain scores. The three main null hypotheses were not rejected since neither the main effects or their interaction were statistically significant at the.05 level. Sample mean vocabulary gain scores were consistently higher for (1) Music, (2) Illustration, and (3) Music-Illustration treatment groups. The sample means belonging to low proficiency level subjects also conformed to this same pattern.    The major conclusion drawn from the findings of this investigation was that musical and non-musical media are equally effective means of promoting second language vocabulary acquisition in limited English proficiency children. That is, songs and oral stories produce comparable amounts of vocabulary acquisition in these learners. Given this finding and the children's enthusiasm for songs, it is recommended that classroom teachers make greater use of story songs as a means of promoting language acquisition.

The effectiveness of preparation programs for elementary school teachers in Texas as viewed by elementary school principals and beginning elementary school teachers,"The major purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs in Texas as viewed by beginning elementary teachers and elementary principals when compared to the competencies of classroom discipline, teaching specific subjects, student evaluation, teaching methods and strategies, human relations skills, and teaching special students. The secondary purpose was to determine the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs in Texas as viewed by beginning elementary teachers when compared to the same six competencies and to the following six variables--age, grade level, teaching experience, marital status, and size and location of school district.    Beginning elementary teachers and principals expressed their views concerning the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs in Texas by completing a questionnaire on the six teaching competencies. The primary hypothesis was measured using a T-test to discover significant means while the secondary hypothesis used a one-way analysis of variance to expose significant relationships between the six competencies and the six variables.    The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) Beginning elementary teachers and elementary principals found teacher preparation programs in Texas doing the most effective job in the competencies of teaching methods and strategies (highest mean score) and student evaluation (second highest mean score). (2) Teacher preparation programs did the least effective job in the competencies of teaching special students (lowest mean score) and classroom discipline (second lowest mean score). (3) The two highest rated items on the questionnaire dealt with daily lesson plans and using objectives while the two lowest items were teacher's ability to instruct English as a Second Language and emotionally handicapped students. (4) Beginning teachers and principals agreed that teacher education programs taught teachers how to teach Reading, Language Arts, and Mathematics effectively and music, art, and physical education ineffectively.",0
Acquiring vocabulary in a foreign language: Some effects of the nature of instruction on the knowledge and use of words,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect that the nature of instruction of French vocabulary words has on student knowledge and use of the words on five different measures: a definition recognition test, a cloze plus word bank test, a comprehension of a text containing the words, a writing assignment designed to elicit free use of these words and a test of overall reading proficiency. Eighty-one high school students in the second year course of French constituted three treatment groups: (1) traditional instruction where students were required to learn a list of 12 words paired with their English equivalents; (2) rich instruction where students were required to learn the list of words paired with a French definition which also encompassed such things as words families, synonyms and antonyms; and (3) extended/rich instruction where students received the same instruction as the rich group plus read magazine articles of choice daily for 20 minutes looking for the words. Materials included two sets of 12 vocabulary words, their definitions, games played with the words and the definitions for all three groups, songs with several of the words by Jean-Jacques Goldman for the rich and extended/rich instruction groups and 46 recent Francophone magazines for the extended/rich instruction group. Results indicated that on the definition recognition test traditional and extended/rich instruction were statistically superior to rich instruction. On the free use of words in writing, no student used any of the vocabulary words during the course of the study. On text comprehension all groups performed equally. On all other measures extended/rich instruction was statistically superior to both traditional and rich instruction. These findings provide support for the inclusion of periods of free reading of print materials chosen by the student according to his interests.",0

Progressive ideas for New Mexico: Educating the Spanish -speaking child in the 1920's and 1930's,"Progressive ideas had tremendous implications for the education of children who differed from those of the middle-class, English-speaking mainstream. Progressive educators believed in molding the curriculum to fit the special needs of the child. For immigrant children, or the Spanish-speaking children of the Southwest, this often meant transforming them into English-speaking Americans. As adherents to scientific authority, progressives looked to scientific tools for the means of identifying special needs and adapting school curricula. This faith in science led to widespread use of intelligence tests as objective means of evaluating and sorting students into differentiated courses of study.    Although progressive ideas arose in response to urban immigrant groups, the same approaches were taken with Spanish-speaking children in the Southwest. In California and Texas, specialized curricula were implemented which stressed learning activities, manual training, and non-academic subjects such as art, music, and character development. The pedagogical pattern of separate curricula often justified physical segregation.    Circumstances in New Mexico gave education there a different character than found in either California or Texas. New Mexico's Spanish-speaking population, although poor, was relatively stable and highly concentrated, giving Hispanics a political voice and a moral influence not enjoyed elsewhere in the Southwest. Educational progress had been slow during a protracted territorial period, but the school system that emerged was modeled upon American standards. With statehood New Mexican educators continued to follow patterns set elsewhere, even though creative ideas on bilingual teaching emerged locally.    Around 1930, however, this imitative tendency changed somewhat with the work of two progressive educators, George I. Sanchez and Loyd S. Tireman. Sanchez used progressive methods to challenge inequities in school funding and assumptions about racial intelligence traits. Tireman founded experimental schools, including the San Jose Training School and the Nambe Community School, which explored effective teaching methods for Spanish-speaking children. Their efforts awakened educators to more humane and equitable means of educating the Spanish-speaking child.",0
The contribution of John Pyke Hullah (1812-84) to music education in the Victorian era,"J.P. Hullah's music teaching method based on that of the French teacher, Wilhem, helped to transform the teaching of vocal music in English schools, and also to promote adult musical education in the early years of the Victorian era. The method itself, however, was only a starting point for many other activities which influenced music education in its broadest sense. Hullah was not merely dedicated to developing mechanical skills, for he believed that a consistency of musical knowledge was important.  The basis of musical appreciation was singing, and both singing in class and in adult choral societies in Hullah's view had a special value in developing a sense of community through access to the great works of choral literature. Hullah's philosophy was akin to that of the Christian Socialists, and he was much influenced by Maurice and Kingsley. Like many other notable Victorians, Hullah was an all-round man. A friend of Charles Dickens, he provided the music for Dickens's only opera libretto. He also composed much vocal and choral music. He had the responsibility of initiating music courses for the training of teachers and in due course he became the first government Inspector of Music. As well as being a great choral director, he was also an accomplished public lecturer. His lectures were turned into books which have a place in the foundations of English musicology. Hullah also has a place in the development of musical criticism through his contributions to the leading journals of the day. The thesis examines the combination of artistic creativity and efficient method that so considerably influenced the development of musical education in England. A tape recording of particular works shows the artist within the teacher. There are also sections containing significant, hitherto unpublished, letters from Hullah, Illustrations concerning his career, and a comprehensive Index of musical and literary works.",0
The relationship of French-immersion education to tonal skills of first- and fourth grade Canadian children,"French immersion has become an educational alternative chosen by an increasing number of Canadian parents. Since the inception of French-immersion education in 1965, specialist music teachers have observed that children in French-immersion classes tend to match pitch better and earlier than their counterparts in unilingual English classes. This study was designed to examine the tonal skills (aural pitch discrimination and vocal pitch-matching skill) of children in grades one and four in dual-track French-immersion/English schools. The 192 subjects were selected from eight schools in the metropolitan area of Edmonton, Alberta. A crossed design was employed in which six children were selected at random in each of the four cells in each of the eight schools. All subjects were tested using the tonal test of Gordon's Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation (1982) and a pitch-matching test designed by Sims, Moore and Kuhn (Psychology of Music, 8, 1982). A three-way analysis of variance showed that even when schools were treated as a random factor, the French-immersion group's scores were superior to the English group's scores on both tests at the.05 level of significance. A parent questionnaire also revealed that influences in the home environment previously demonstrated in the research literature to be related to the development of music skills are significantly more prevalent in the homes of French-immersion students than in the homes of students in the regular English program: parents of French-immersion students are better educated; more French-immersion students take private music lessons; there are more musical instruments in the homes of French-immersion students; more French-immersion parents report that they sing to or with their children; more French-immersion parents report that they take their children to musical concerts. Although a gender imbalance was observed between the two programs, with more girls than boys found enrolled in the French-immersion program and more boys than girls found enrolled in the regular English program, gender was not found to be significantly related to achievement on the two tests of tonal skills.",0
A multivariant study of linguistic background characteristics and writing proficiency in Spanish,"This study was based on the premise that through prior study of foreign language and the native language system, learners may apply linguistic knowledge and communicative skills to the complicated task of composing in a foreign language. The purpose of the study was to determine whether writing proficiency in Spanish can be predicted from any of the following variables singly or in combination: writing proficiency in English, verbal ability, gender, and certain background factors relevant to language learning.    Two instruments--Hunt's T-unit analysis and the Diederich Composition Scale--were selected to measure the composition skill level in both English and Spanish of 60 high school students. The criterion variable, Spanish writing proficiency, was derived from the numerical counts of T-unit analysis and the composite score of the Diederich Composition Scale. The eight variables in combination quantify the syntactic complexity of sentences, the incidence of error, and the composite of specified composition skills. The predictor variables were the same for all hypotheses: English writing proficiency as measured by T-unit analysis and the Diederich Composition Scale, verbal ability as measured by the PSAT verbal score, gender, Spanish achievement as measured by a National Spanish Examination score, years of Spanish study, languages other than English and Spanish studied, languages other than English spoken at home, and travel to a Hispanic country. The data were analyzed using a multiple regression approach.    For each of the criterion variables, one or more of the variables used to measure English writing proficiency contributed significantly to the predictor equation. Those variables that figured most frequently in the equations were: main clause coordination index, mean T-unit length, the ratio of error-free to total T-units, and the Diederich composite score. None of the other predictor variables were placed in the equations for the tolerance established. The relationship of the measures of English and Spanish writing proficiency suggests that to some extent the development and level of attainment possible in Spanish composition can be predicted from the students' English writing.",0

AN ANTHOLOGY OF SELECTED CHORAL MUSIC OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOR DEVELOPING MUSICIANSHIP IN GRADES 9 THROUGH 12,"In this research, an anthology of selected Judaic choral music was presented for students in grades 9 through 12 in such a manner that students can develop musicianship skills and insights into the Jewish civilization.    Jan La Rue's style analysis was used for the development of musicianship in high school singers. Sources of musicianship and choral training were examined and concepts were ""fit into"" Lewis W. Gordon's model for developing musicianship within the secondary school choral rehearsal. A comprehensive checklist of musical concepts was developed and sent to a jury which judged both the importance of each musical concept to the student's choral understanding and the grade level in which the concept is best introduced: beginning, intermediate or advanced. After contacting publishers and composers and surveying Judaic Choral music in English, Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino published from 1850 to the present and unpublished from 1900 to the present, works were selected for school and community use according to grade level. The anthology was divided into beginning, intermediate and advanced levels and the musical concepts appropriate for each level appear in the introduction to each respective book of the anthology alongside titles of musical selections which contain the concepts. After each of the forty-five choral works, one essay discusses the important musical concepts therein and a second essay gives suggestions for interpretation based on musical, textual and cultural considerations. Preceding Book I of the Anthology, a chapter on the holidays and festivals of the Jewish year provides cultural background as each choral selection is linked to a holiday or theme.    By means of an analytical approach to the choral rehearsal, the anthology of Judaic choral music develops independent musicians who can carry the acquired learnings throughout their lives. By linking choral music to the musical interpretation of Jewish texts, appreciation of the philosophy, history, theology and strivings of the Jewish people is fostered. The combination of musicianship and cultural understanding cultivates individuals who will contribute to choral organizations and who will be capable of experiencing the total art of music for years to come.",0
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SUGGESTOPEDIC APPROACH IN TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TO ADULT LEARNERS (TESL),"For the last decade, Southeast Asians have consisted of a large portion of refugees to the United States. There is a great need for this population group to be rapidly integrated into the social and economic structure. The challenge is not only to develop a successful program based on the effective instructional approaches in teaching English as a second language (ESL) to those adult immigrants but also to help them attain adequate and successful psychological, cultural, and social adjustment.    For the older child and the adult, the second-language acquisition processes consist of a mixture of language ""acquisition"" and ""learning."" Thus, any approach that deals with language, focusing on both acquisition and learning, will be fruitful. Suggestopedia is a psychotherapeutic system that is based on the application of suggestology to education and specifically to foreign-language instruction. The Suggestopedic procedures were designed to enable individuals to acquire language at the conscious and slightly unconscious levels. The methodology remains a highly structured approach to the total personality of the learner through specific relaxation techniques, baroque music, accelerated, reinforced, pleasant, and naturally stimulating types of learning.    The purpose of this study was to investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of the Suggestopedic approach in teaching English as a second language to Southeast Asian and East African adult immigrants at the Refugee Women's Program in San Francisco. Students' English proficiency in grammar (STEL) and job-related English (VIT) was assessed before and after eight-week instructional period.    Results of this study indicate that both Suggestopedic groups' STEL achievement scores showed statistically significant gains above those of a local norm group receiving conventional instruction over an 18-week period. Comparison of the two Suggestopedic groups was supported by a significant gain in vocabulary during the program. These findings also support the hypothesis that the Suggestopedic approach is effective in improving not only vocabulary but also English grammar proficiency.    Learning a language is to learn how to communicate effectively. Thus, in any language class, the teacher should employ a technique that will provide nearly-genuine speech environment. Suggestopedic is an approach that facilitates second-language acquisition naturally with emphasis on communicative competence and realistic utterance.",0
TOWARD A RATIONALE FOR FOREIGN-LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR DOCTORAL DEGREES IN SELECTED PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINES,"Problem. In the United States, a uniquely American situation exists in that there appears to be no uniform or consistent comprehensive rationale underlying foreign-language study and proficiency requirements for doctoral degrees. As contrasted to students in other parts of the world, especially in Europe--where compulsory basic requirements are usually met by language studies in elementary through secondary school--most American graduate students are ill-prepared for foreign-language proficiency examinations on the doctoral level.    Method. Historical literature was reviewed to gather information regarding the development of foreign-language requirements in the United States and in Europe. In addition, a request for information about current procedures in American institutions of higher learning was sent to the principal administrator of each school accredited by professional accrediting associations and offering doctoral degrees in education, business, music, and theology. A comprehensive rationale was synthesized on the basis of historical trends, current practices, and concepts expressed by administrators. The rationale was sent to a panel of forty randomly selected administrators for validation.    Results. The rationale addresses eleven issues:  (1) the need for foreign-language requirements on the doctoral level; (2) the purposes for such requirements; (3) the number of languages to be required; (4) specific languages to be required; (5) function of language competence; (6) degree of competence needed; (7) needs for other tools; (8) relationship between general and specific requirements; (9) appropriate time for completing foreign-language study; (10) administration; and (11) institutional policies.    Conclusions and Recommendations. It was concluded that:  (1) A comprehensive rationale must be flexible as needs vary; (2) There is a need to establish priorities as to which tool subjects are most useful in each discipline; (3) Basic foreign-language studies should be completed before doctoral studies are begun whenever feasible; (4) Foreign-language study should be strongly encouraged, but foreign languages should not automatically be part of doctoral requirements; (5) When there is a need for specific foreign-language competences in a discipline, these should be specified in the publications of professional schools; (6) When there is a demonstrable need within an individual program, any foreign language should be allowed to fulfill doctoral requirements; (7) Lack of an adequate foreign-language background may limit study options in some professional disciplines",0
"SPANISH/ENGLISH BILINGUAL-BICULTURAL COMPETENCIES FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS AS PERCEIVED BY FOUR DIFFERENT ROLE GROUPS IN NEW YORK STATE (TRAINING, EDUCATION, PRE/IN-SERVICE)","Purpose. The purpose of this study is to provide a curricular data base for the development of programs for the training of Spanish/English bilingual-bicultural elementary teachers. Four different expert role groups:  (1) professors from Institutions of Higher Education, (2) teachers, (3) Bilingual-Bicultural Education Program Directors/Supervisors, and (4) local educational agency Administrators, from the field of bilingual-bicultural education were used to collect the data.    Methodology. After a review of the literature in the field of bilingual-bicultural education training, ten goal level core areas of competency were identified by the researcher. (I) Knowledge of bilingual-bicultural education theory. (II) Knowledge of the Spanish vocabulary needed to be able to teach subject areas in Spanish (i.e., Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, etc.) (III) Knowledge of Spanish linguistics and literature to enable the teacher to teach Spanish reading and language arts.

The panel of bilingual-bicultural education experts: professors from Institutions of Higher Education, Teachers, Bilingual-Bicultural Education Program Directors/Supervisors and LEA Administrators were asked to modify the ten goal level core areas of competency. The respondent panelists did not elect to modify the ten goal level core areas of competency. The panelists were also asked to list sub goal level competencies under each of the ten goal level areas.    Results. After regrouping and combining by the researcher, one hundred and eighty (180) sub goal level competencies were derived. The results of the study indicate that the respondent groups differed in rating certain goal level core area competencies.",0
AN EVALUATION OF A TELEVISION PROGRAM AS A LEARNING PROCESS FOR EARLY ELEMENTARY STUDENTS,"This study looks at how much learning takes place from viewing a locally produced, 15 minute color television program based on fine arts and communication skills. The program, ""Facts Factory,"" was viewed by Kindergarten and Primary One students from selected Detroit, Michigan, elementary schools. The series had as its base the curriculum developed by the South West Regional Laboratory (SWRL) dealing with music, expressive language (drama), composition, and art.    The major objective of this study was to investigate the effect 15 selected weekly television programs had on cognitive learning. The investigation included these relevant variables:  (1)sex, (2)race, (3)grade level, (4)home language, (5)ethnic background, and (6)achievement based on teacher-made tests. These variables contribute to the total evaluation process regarding educational television as a facet of instruction important to the Early Elementary curriculum.    A secondary objective explores the belief that a child's gainful learning from television decreases at 6 years of age, versus those who feel that the decline does not take place until a child is 10 or 12.    The procedure used was as follows: the Kindergarten and Primary One treatment groups took both a pre and posttest covering each of the 15 programs; the Kindergarten and Primary One control groups were tested once on each program and all tests contained four items. The tests were administered by student teachers to avoid any prejudice on the part of the senior teachers involved. The test response data were keypunched for computer-assisted analyses of the data.    After tabulating the analyzed data it was found that students did gain enrichment and information in fine arts and communication skills by watching a weekly classroom television program. This conclusion is based on evidence obtained by comparing pre and post test mean scores for both Kindergarten and Primary One treatment students. A statistically significant improvement at the .05 level was obtained for both Kindergarten and Primary One groups.    When the Kindergarten treatment group was compared to the control group, it was found that the treatment group mean was above the control group mean. This was also true when comparing the Primary One treatment and control groups.    This study also indicates that the true bilingual child who is not native born and speaks a language other than English with equal ease, realizes a slightly higher post mean score than native Americans or the student with a language other than English as their communication tool.    Primary One students demonstrated greater improvement in  fine arts and communication skills on both post mean and mean gain scores. Both scores were statistically significant at the .05 level.    In conclusion, it was observed that students are able to learn from educational television programming, and that educational television can successfully teach and broaden a student's grasp of fine arts and communication skills.",0
NOUN REPERTOIRE OF SPANISH-SPEAKING PRE-KINDERGARTEN AGE CHILDREN COMPARED WITH KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS' EXPECTATIONS,"The purpose of the study was to determine the noun repertoire of Spanish-speaking pre-kindergarten age children and to compare this with kindergarten teachers' expectations of the same.    Specifically, the study sought to answer the following questions:  (1) What Spanish nouns are in the comprehension vocabulary of pre-kindergarten age Spanish-speaking children? (2) What Spanish nouns are in the production vocabulary of pre-kindergarten age Spanish-speaking children? (3) Is there a significant difference in the number of nouns that pre-kindergarten age children comprehend and the number that they actually produce? (4) What Spanish nouns are expected by kindergarten teachers to be in the comprehension vocabulary of pre-kindergarten age Spanish-speaking children? (5) What Spanish nouns are expected by kindergarten teachers to be in the production vocabulary of pre-kindergarten age Spanish-speaking children? (6) Is there a significant difference in the number of nouns that kindergarten teachers expect pre-kindergarten age children to comprehend and the number that they expect them to produce? (7) How do the teachers' expectations of the children's vocabulary--on the comprehension and production levels--compare with the children's actual vocabulary?    The subjects were 30 Spanish-speaking children--18 girls and 12 boys--whose ages ranged from 3 years, 11 months (3.11) to 5 years, 2 months (5.2).    The teachers involved in the study were sixty bilingual (Spanish/English) kindergarten teachers actually teaching in bilingual bicultural classrooms.    The nouns in the subjects' vocabulary--comprehension and production levels--were determined by means of an oral language assessment instrument based on a pictorial word list, both of which were constructed by the author. The teachers' expectations of the children's noun vocabulary were determined by means of the teachers assessment instrument, also made by the author and based on the oral language assessment instrument.    The data showed that:  (1) The categories of nouns comprehended by most of the children were: body parts, school, house, numbers, miscellaneous, food, and clothing. The least comprehended were: transportation, trees and flowers, cleaning supplies and people. (2) The noun categories produced by the most of the children were: body parts, numbers, colors, toys, food and animals. Those produced by the least number of children were: trees and flowers, cleaning supplies, places, transportation, musical instruments and people. (3) The children comprehended significantly more words than they produced. (4) The categories of nouns which the teachers expected most of the children to produce were: body parts, transportation, toys and animals. (5) The categories of nouns which the teachers expected most of the children to comprehend were: transportation, body parts, food, toys, animals and people. (6) The teachers' expectation of the children's comprehension vocabulary is more than their expectation of their production vocabulary. (7) The teachers' estimate of the children's noun vocabulary--on both recognition and production levels--compared with the children's actual noun vocabulary, is very low.    Additionally, it was found that there is very little correlation between the categories wherein the children achieved highest and lowest and the categories wherein the teachers expected them to achieve the highest and the lowest.    On the basis of the findings, the following conclusions can be made:  (1) the comprehension vocabulary of pre-kindergarten children is significantly greater than their production vocabulary, and (2) the pre-kindergarten children's actual noun vocabulary (comprehension and production) is significantly greater than the expectations of the kindergarten teachers.",0
"MUSIC, COLOR, AND LANGUAGE","The purpose of this dissertation was the creation, implementation, and testing of ColorSounds('(R)), a multimedia program for enhancing language arts skills, reading, and speaking abilities. A state of the art overview of music and color components in such areas as reading, foreign language teaching, and special education was presented. Assertions and supporting data were stated, evaluated, and (where relevant) included in the psychopedagogical theories which reinforce the basis of the approach utilized.    The thesis was that lyric music materials and linguistic identification techniques, e.g., the color coding of phonemes, could be incorporated into the language acquisition and production process, with favorable results. The written lyrics of a popular song were presented on a prearranged schedule to experimental groups and comparison groups. All groups were administered a ""pre-test"", in which identical typewritten material was recorded by each subject without benefit of prior exposure in the classroom. Multiple sensory input, including music (melody, lyrics, rhythm, rhyme) and color coding of vowel sounds were incorporated systematically into the language learning program of the experimental group. The music component only was included in the program of one of the comparison groups. The other group was taught the material via traditional techniques and methods described in Job Corps Guidebook for the Teaching of English as a Second Language (ESL), U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration. A descriptive analysis of the cassette recordings of the subjects reading the material was presented.    Subsequent testing involved much larger experimental populations of junior high school remedial reading and ESOL students (AISD). Standardized testing was conducted independently by AISD administrators and teachers using The Botel Phonics Test and The Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS). Finally, attendance data was collected on a group of children aged five through thirteen in The Street Academy (NAACP Youth Safety Centers) in Atlanta, Georgia.    Comparative analysis of the data from a comparable series of tests suggests that both passive and active language skills are enhanced in several areas by the systematic inclusion of both lyric music and a vocalic sound-phonics system. Conclusions incude generalizations about broadening the scope of ColorSounds('(A)) to include native language learning by children and standard language proficiency enhancement among native speakers of nonstandard dialects.",1
"AN ANALYSIS OF TEACHERS' ATTITUDES TOWARD STATE BILINGUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM OF SELECTED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE TEXAS COASTAL BEND AREA, K-6","Introduction. August 27, 1973 marked a new era in the educational system in educating those children who come from environments where the mother tongue is other than English. On this date the amended Texas Education Act was to be implemented in the Texas public schools. School districts in the state of Texas who had no previous bilingual programs established, were mandated to establish bilingual programs by the Texas Education Act, Section 21.453.    Statement of the Problem. This research proposes to conduct an analysis of attitudes held by elementary school teachers toward the state bilingual program implemented in selected school districts of the state of Texas Coastal Bend Area. More specifically, this study elicited the teachers' attitudes in reference to students' performance levels, and concerning the instructional program designed to educate children of limited English-speaking ability in grades kindergarten through six.    Statement of Objectives. In order to provide direction in conducting this study, the following objectives were developed:  (1) What is the amount of time devoted to Spanish instruction? (2) What subjects are used to teach oral language skills? (3) What instructional materials are being used? (4) What teaching strategies are being used? (5) What procedures are used for the program's evaluation? (6) What is the extent of community support?    Conclusions. As a result of this study, it was concluded that:  (1) time allocated to Spanish was adequate; (2) reading, math, and music should teach oral language skills; (3) materials were adapted to the students' capability; (4) group discussion and games were most widely used; (5) teachers were not cognizant if the program was evaluated; (6) the community did not support the bilingual program; (7) reading and math should be taught in Spanish daily; (8) inservice-training was available, however did not prepare teachers to teach bilingual education; (9) parents helped their children at home very little.",0
WALLENBERG AND HIS ENGLISH CONTEMPORARIES: A STUDY IN AFFINITIES,"This dissertation offers a comparative study of the eighteenth-century Swedish writer, Jacob Wallenberg, and five English writers of his era--Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, Tobias Smollett, Oliver Goldsmith and Laurence Sterne. Wallenberg achieved literary fame by virtue of the publication of a comical travel book, Min son pa galejan (1781), which was based on his experiences on board a schooner in route to the East Indies. Although his travel book is considered to be a native masterpiece, Swedish scholars have frequently speculated on whether Wallenberg was influenced by English or French contemporaries. The focus of this study is to define those common affinities in matters of form and substance which Wallenberg shared with his English contemporaries. Scholars have treated inadequately the English writers' influence in the past, and this study is intended to correct their oversight.    Wallenberg's life history and intellectual orientation have been discussed with particular emphasis on his scholastic and classical education from his childhood and adolescent years. As a product of the enlightenment, he was an intensely inquisitive intellectual who read extensively in French, German and English as well as in Latin and Greek. In addition to being a travel book writer, Wallenberg wrote a multitude of occasional poems, drinking songs and one successful play, Susanna.    For further background to this study, one chapter has been devoted to what Swedish scholars have said concerning the sources and inspiration for Min son pa galejan.    Wallenberg wrote an altogether new form of travel book, one which broke from the established genre of the serious documentary travel book in Swedish literature. Min son pa galejan is part travel book, almost part novel, part lyrical, part prose, highly subjective and dependent upon many conventions of the causerie, or periodical essay. Wallenberg's prose, which relies upon the spoken, not written, language, is very expressive, often coarse, sometimes ribald and always readable.    Travel book writing was very well established in eighteenth-century and earlier English literature. It became the foundation for the emergence of the novel in its earliest forms and for the development of an innovative, hybrid form of travel book in many ways similar to Min son pa galejan. Defoe, Fielding, Smollett, Goldsmith and Sterne each produced travel literature which shared with Min son pa galejan the common characteristics of (1) the universal plot of journey by land or water and (2) unusual originality and creativity in literary devices and/or literary purpose. Among the more relevant travel works discussed were: Defoe's A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain . . ., Fielding's The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon, Smollett's Travels Through France and Italy, Goldsmith's poem ""The Traveller,"" and Sterne's Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy.    Various stylistic features were common to Wallenberg's writing and that of his English contemporaries: structural elements of the novel--chapters, books, rubrics and the placement of the preface; the influence of the causerie, or periodical essay--the comical and/or satirical opiniative digression and socially-oriented narrative meant to entertain more than to instruct; the incidence of black humor and indecent subject matter; and detailed realism with well developed grotesque caricatures.    The conclusion of this study in affinities is that Wallenberg wrote in a literary tradition which was not purely of his own invention, nor was it strictly germaine to his native Sweden. His English contemporaries collectively could have inspired Wallenberg for most of the definitive features of Min son pa galejan. They wrote in a related or similar genre in approximately the same period of time.",0
"MUSIC IN STATE-SUPPORTED EDUCATION IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA, 1848-1920","This investigation considers the development of class music teaching in New South Wales and Victoria during the first seventy-two years of state-supported primary education. Looking firstly at the English background to this study, the principal music teaching methods (which resulted from the English choral singing movement of the mid-nineteenth century) as well as the subsequent development of music teaching in English elementary schools are discussed.    The promotion of school music is then considered on a broadly chronological basis in each state and a number of themes are seen to emerge in relation to developments in school music policy and practice during the period. The major themes include such issues as whether music should be part of the ordinary school curriculum or an extra-curricular subject, whether musical instruction should be given by generalist or specialist teachers, and which method should be employed for teaching children to read music. Other major themes include the controversy between protagonists of the respective staff and tonic sol-fa notations, the issue of teacher training in music for ordinary class teachers, and the relationship of curriculum content to the aims and objectives of school music. In addition comparisons are made, and parallels drawn, between developments in both states and also between the respective states and school music in England.    The final chapter demonstrates the relevance of many of the historical themes for music education today. There is a drawing together of the main themes which enables certain trends in school music policy and practice as well as certain problems and deficiencies which emerged during the period 1848-1920 to be clearly identified. These are then considered in relation to the contemporary school music scene.    The findings are that certain aspects at present represent a continuation of former policies and practices while other aspects represent a departure from the traditions of the past. For example, the recent introduction of the ""new"" Kodaly method represents a continuation of the movable doh solmisation system which has in fact been a traditional feature of school music teaching in New South Wales since the nineteenth century. On the other hand, the phasing-out of prescribed music curricula in both states in favour of school-based curriculum planning represents an obvious departure from tradition.    In addition there are certain problems and deficiencies in primary music education at present which have either persisted since 1920 or have re-emerged from the past. For example, the low priority afforded to music in the primary curriculum and the lack of musical competence among generalist teachers have become almost traditional features of primary education in both states. There is also a re-emergence of the problem of inadequate musical training for primary teachers in many pre-service teacher training courses at present. The thesis concludes by citing a recurring problem from the past, namely the lack of co-ordination between various aspects of school music policy, as the most serious problem to be overcome if primary school children are to receive effective and worthwhile music education in the future.",0

Literarische Sprachspiele als Mittel des Spracherwerbs,"Literarische Texte werden im Deutschunterricht oftmals benutzt, um - wie in Übungstexten aus Lehrbüchern - grammatische Regeln zu üben und zu erklären. Dabei wird die ästhetische Seite der Texte i.d.R. vernachlässigt. Der Beitrag zeigt, wie gerade dieser Aspekt literarischer Texte zum Ausgangspunkt für sprachliches Lernen gemacht werden kann. An ausgewählten Beispielen wird demonstriert, wie sich im Anfängerunterricht durch die kreative Arbeit mit Texten der experimentellen und konkreten Poesie sowie der Elementarliteratur (wie z.B. Kinderreime, Kinderlieder und Sprachspiele) sprachliches, kulturelles und literarisches Lernen, kreatives Schreiben und grammatisches Üben miteinander verbinden lassen. (Verlag, adapt.).",0

LIEDER IM FRÜHEN DaF-UNTERRICHT: Analyse des Materialangebots,"Die kindliche Leichtigkeit eine fremde Sprache zu absorbieren und das deutsche Sprichwort „Wo man singt, da lass dich nieder, nur böse Menschen mögen keine Lieder“ haben mich bei der Wahl meines Diplomarbeitsthemas motiviert. Der Hauptgrund für die Wahl ist mein persönliches Interesse an dem frühen DaF-Unterricht und die Idee die fremde Sprache den Kindern in dieser frühen Phase durch Lieder nahe zu bringen. Der frühe Fremdsprachunterricht in meiner Diplomarbeit basiert auf dem Deutschunterricht im Kindergarten und in der ersten Triade der Grundschule in Slowenien. Die Kinder/Schüler lernen durch die Lieder verschiedene Kulturen kennen und erweitern so ihren Horizont. Beim Zuhören oder beim Singen der Lieder haben sie meistens Spaß, können entspannen, gerne tanzen sie auch dazu. In der Schule werden die Schüler durch die Lieder für weitere Arbeit motiviert.     Die Diplomarbeit beinhaltet ein Konzept des frühen Fremdsprachenlernens mit Hilfe von Liedern. Es wird der Frage nachgegangen, wie und wieso Lieder im frühen Fremdsprachenlernen eingesetzt werden können. Im theoretischen Teil wird das frühe Fremdsprachenlernen erläutert, wann er beginnen soll, welche Empfehlungen es dazu gibt. Es werden auch verschiedene Meinungen und Untersuchungen von verschiedenen Autoren über den frühen Fremdsprachenunterricht und über die Art des Gebrauchs von Liedern im frühen DaF vorgestellt.     Im empirischen Teil werden einige Kinderlieder, die man im frühen DaF- Unterricht einsetzen kann vorgestellt und analysiert.     Otroška lahkotnost, da lahko brez večjih ovir absorbirajo tuj jezik in nemški pregovor, ˝Wo man singt, da lass dich nieder, nur böse Menschen mögen keine Lieder˝, sta me motivirala pri izbiri teme diplomske naloge. Glavna razloga za mojo izbiro pa sta bila moje osebno zanimanje za zgodnje poučevanje nemškega jezika in ideja, kako otrokom približati tuj jezik v njihovi zgodnji fazi skozi pesmi. Zgodnje poučevanje tujih jezikov v diplomski nalogi tako temelji na poučevanju nemškega jezika v vrtcu in v prvem triletju osnovne šole v Sloveniji. Otroci in učenci s pomočjo pesmi spoznavajo različne kulture in širijo svoja obzorja. Ob poslušanju ali petju pesmi se zabavajo, sprostijo, ob njih radi tudi zaplešejo, v šoli pa jih pesmi motivirajo za njihovo nadaljnje delo.     V diplomski nalogi je predstavljen koncept zgodnjega poučevanja tujega jezika s pomočjo pesmi, kako in zakaj se pesmi lahko uporabljajo pri zgodnjem poučevanju jezikov. V teoretičnem delu bo predstavljeno in razloženo zgodnje poučevanje jezikov, kdaj je primeren čas, da se začnejo učiti tujega jezika ter priporočila za poučevanje. Predstavljena bodo mnenja in študije o zgodnjem poučevanju tujega jezika različni avtorjev, govora bo tudi o načinu uporabe pesmi pri zgodnjem poučevanju nemškega jezika.     V empiričnem delu bodo predstavljene in analizirane nekatere pesmi, katere so se mi zdele primerne za pridobivanje znanja pri zgodnjem poučevanju nemškega jezika.",0

Mehrsprachigkeit als Ressource: Kompetenzen dual-immersiv unterrichteter Schülerinnen und Schüler in der Drittsprache Englisch,"Mehrsprachigkeit wird nach Cummins' Interdependenz- und Schwellenhypothese sowie darauf aufbauenden kognitionspsychologischen und psycholinguistischen Prozesstheorien mit Vorteilen für das Erlernen weiterer Sprachen in Verbindung gebracht. An den Standorten der Staatlichen Europa-Schule Berlin (SESB) werden Schülerinnen und Schüler unterschiedlichen sprachlichen Hintergrunds nach dem Prinzip der dualen Immersion zu gleichen Teilen auf Deutsch und je einer Partnersprache unterrichtet. Der dual-immersive Unterricht an der SESB wirkt sich positiv auf den Lernerfolg in der Fremdsprache Englisch (L3) aus. Dies zeigen eine kriterielle Verortung der Englischleistungen von N = 541 Schülerinnen und Schülern der SESB am Ende der Sekundarstufe I im Kontext der Bildungsstandards sowie ein sozialer Vergleich mit konventionell unterrichteten Gleichaltrigen unter Berücksichtigung von Hintergrundmerkmalen. Die guten Leistungen in der Fremdsprache Englisch deuten auf zwischensprachlichen Transfer bei dual-immersiv unterrichteten Schülerinnen und Schülern hin. Dies unterstützen auch die Ergebnisse einer multiplen Regressionsanalyse, nach der sowohl erst- als auch zweitsprachige Fähigkeiten einen substanziellen Einfluss auf das Leseverstehen in der Drittsprache haben. Hinweise auf eine kritische Schwelle finden sich dabei nicht. Die Befunde werden im Zusammenhang mit den grundsätzlichen Potenzialen der Mehrsprachigkeit und der Förderung erstsprachiger Kompetenzen bei Schülerinnen und Schülern mit Zuwanderungshintergrund diskutiert. (DIPF/Orig.).     Multilingualism is associated with benefits for learning additional languages based on cognitive and psycholinguistic process theories following Cummins' interdependence and threshold hypotheses. At the locations of Berlin's Europe School (SESB), students with different language backgrounds are taught in German and one partner language in equal shares, according to the concept of dual immersion. Dual-language instruction at the SESB has a positive influence on achievement in English as a foreign language (L3). This positive influence is shown by a criterion-based localization of English skills of N = 541 students at the end of lower secondary school in the context of national educational standards as well as by a social comparison with conventionally-taught peers, controlling for background characteristics. The high achievement in English as a foreign language points towards interlanguage transfer in dual-immersion students. This claim is supported by the results of a multiple regression analysis, according to which first and second language skills substantially influence reading comprehension in the L3. However, there are no indicators of a critical threshold. The findings are discussed in regard to the general potential of multilingualism and the support of first language skills in students with a heritage language background. (DIPF/Orig.).",0

Keine Angst vor der Muttersprache - vor den (anderen) Fremdsprachen aber auch nicht! Überlegungen zum Verhältnis von Einsprachigkeit und Zweisprachigkeit im Fremdsprachenunterricht,"Die heute vorliegenden Forschungsergebnisse erlauben einen differenzierteren Blick auf die Rolle der Muttersprache bei der Aneignung einer fremden Sprache. Im Beitrag wird versucht, dieses differenzierte Bild nachzuzeichnen und die Rolle der Muttersprache aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven auszuleuchten: Welche Erkenntnisse zur Sprachverarbeitung und zum Spracherwerb und welche vermittlungsmethodische Einsichten erlauben uns, die Rolle der Muttersprache zu bestimmen? Welche Bedeutung haben dabei der Bezug zur außerunterrichtlichen Realität der Lernenden und die dem scheinbar gegenüberstehende natürliche Künstlichkeit des Fremdsprachenunterrichts? Was bedeutet dies alles für den Umgang mit Sprachen im fremdsprachlichen Klassenzimmer und im bilingualen Sachfachunterricht? (Verlag, adapt.).",0
Lady Gaga. Privacy and the Press (ab Jahrgangsstufe 9),"Ob im Fleischkostüm oder bedeckt von einer Kermit-der-Frosch-Jacke, der Karriere der US-amerikanischen Sängerin und Künstlerin Lady Gaga scheint nichts zu schaden. Sie ist eine Popikone, die besonders durch ihren exzentrischen Kleidungsstil für Aufsehen sorgt. Darüber hinaus landet sie mit ihren populären Liedern immer wieder auf Platz 1 der Charts. In der Unterrichtseinheit kann diese Thematik deshalb idealerweise fächerübergreifend (zum Beispiel Musik (Lieder singen) oder Kunst (Modenschau)) eingesetzt werden.

Rezeptives Code-Switching ein- und mehrsprachiger Lerner/innen in multilingualen Settings,"This paper looks at receptive code-switching in elementary school dyads working with digital multilingual and multimodal storybooks ('MuViT'). Learners with diverse linguistic backgrounds, collaboratively read an English story that allowed for receptive code-switching to German (L1/L2, school language) and/or to Turkish (L1 of some learners) at any point. Analyzing the receptive language choice of four dyads, four approaches to receptive code-switching could be observed: macro-switches (pupils read a story first in one language, then in the other language), focused switches and open switches (short switches where the focus seems to lie on curiosity and enjoyment rather than on non-comprehension). A final option was to refrain from code-switching. German seems to play a bigger role in receptive code-switching from English than Turkish did: no focused switches to Turkish were observed.

KINDERLYRIK IN LEHRBÜCHERN FÜR DEUTSCH ALS FREMDSPRACHE IN DER 2. TRIADE DER GRUNDSCHULE,"In dieser Diplomarbeit wurde die Kinderlyrik in Lehrbüchern für Deutsch als Fremdsprache, die in der 2. Triade der Grundschule in Slowenien verwendet wird bzw. wurde, untersucht. Bei der Bestimmung des Begriffes Kinderlyrik gerät man in ein Dilemma, denn dieser Begriff ist ein noch relativ junger Terminus, der selten als selbstständiger Bereich der Lyrik anerkannt und verschieden interpretiert wird. Im empirischen Teil wurden die Vertretung der Lyrik und ihre Aufteilung in den Lehrbüchern dargestellt. Als Grundlage dienten 15 Lehrbücher, die wir anhand der verschiedensten Kinderlyrik-Formen und Genres, der Herkunft und Entstehung usw. analysiert hatten. Das Korpus der Kinderreime und Kinderverse, Kindergedichte, Kinderlieder, Kinderspiele und Sprachspiele wurde aus Lehrbüchern nach der Art und Weise des Theoretikers Kurt Franz gesammelt. Die Vertretung der Kinderlyrik ist nach der Quantität und verschiedensten Aufteilungen in den Lehrbüchern verschieden gegliedert. Hinsichtlich des Genre sind die Kinderlieder am häufigsten vertreten, nach der Herkunft und Entstehung folgt die Kinderkunstlyrik. Themen über Tiere und das Alltagsleben sind am häufigsten in den lyrischen Texten nachzuweisen. Schlussendlich kann man aus der Forschungsarbeit folgern, dass für die Lehrer und die Lernenden eine zahlreiche, vielfälltige und qualitätsvolle Kinderlyrik zur Verfügung steht.     V diplomskem delu je bila preučevana otroška lirika v učbenikih za nemščino kot tuji jezik, ki je oziroma je bila uporabljena v 2. triadi osnovne šole v Sloveniji. Pri opredeljevanju pojma otroška lirika se je pokazala dilema, kajti ta pojem je še relativno mlad términ, ki je redko priznan kot samostojno področje lirike in različno interpretiran. V empiričnem delu je bila predstavljena zastopanost lirike in njene delitve v učbenikih. Kot podlaga je služilo 15 učbenikov, kateri so bili analizirani na podlagi različnih oblik in zvrsti otroške lirike, porekla in nastanka itd. Korpus otroških rim in verzov, otroških pesmi, otroških samospevov, otroških iger in jezikovnih iger je bil zbran iz učbenikov po načinu teoretika Kurta Franza. Zastopanost otroške lirike je v učbenikih glede kvantitete in različnih delitev različno členjena. Glede na žanr je prisotnih največ otroških samospevov, po poreklu in nastanku je najbolj številna otroška umetna lirika. Tematiki o živalih in vsakdanjem življenju sta nabolj prisotni v lirskih besedilih. Na kratko lahko iz raziskave povzamemo, da so za učitelje in učence na razpolago številna raznolika in kakovostna otroška lirska besedila.",0

"Film im Fremdsprachenunterricht. Literarische Stoffe, interkulturelle Ziele, mediale Wirkung. [Tagung, die im November 2008 an der Martin-Luther-Universtität Halle-Wittenberg stattfand].","Der vorliegende Band befasst sich mit dem Einsatz von Filmen im Englisch-, Französisch-, Spanisch- und Italienischunterricht. Ausgehend vom aktuellen fachdidaktischen Diskussionsstand werden in 22 Einzelbeiträgen theoretische Konzepte und unterrichtspraktische Vorschläge für die Behandlung klassischer und avantgardistischer Filme entwickelt. Bei den Literaturverfilmungen stehen dabei die intermedialen Transformationsprozesse zwischen Buch und Film im Vordergrund, die den Schülern Gelegenheit zur Analyse der filmspezifischen Mittel bieten. In einer zweiten Gruppe von Beiträgen wird untersucht, inwieweit die filmbezogene Wahrnehmungsschulung, insbesondere das Seh-Verstehen, zur Förderung der inter- und transkulturellen Kompetenz der Schüler genutzt werden kann. Schließlich werden, über das klassische Spielfilmformat hinausgehend, die didaktisch-methodischen Möglichkeiten weiterer Filmgattungen wie Episodenfilm, Kurzfilm, Dokumentarfilm, Doku-Drama, Sitcom und Musikvideoclip diskutiert und damit neue Felder für den Film im Fremdsprachenunterricht erschlossen.

Kindgemäßes Fremdsprachenlernen. Zur Theorie und Praxis des Frühbeginns Englisch.,"Fremdsprachenlernen in der Grundschule wurde in den einzelnen Ländern der Bundesrepublik Deutschland auf sehr unterschiedliche Weise erprobt und eingeführt. Dieses Buch gibt eine Orientierung über geschichtliche Zusammenhänge und stellt die Grundlagen der Frühbeginndiskussion vor, die zu verschiedenen Konzeptionen des Frühbeginns führten. Zentrale Kapitel widmen sich Aspekten der Kindgemäßheit und entwicklungspsychologischen Voraussetzungen von Kindern in der Schuleingangsstufe. Dies geschieht unter Berücksichtigung von Erkenntnissen aus der Hirnforschung und psycholinguistischen Aspekten. Im zweiten Teil wird die Konzeption des Fremdsprachenfrühbeginns in Baden-Württemberg beschrieben. Analog zum Bildungsplan 2004 wird mit praxiserprobten Beispielen gezeigt, wie Unterrichtsprinzipien umgesetzt und Kompetenzen (im Bereich Hören, Sprechen, Lesen, Schreiben) kindgemäß gefördert werden können. Hierzu werden Geschichten, Reime, Chants, Gedichte, Lieder und kreative Aktivitäten vorgestellt. Anhand von exemplarischen Unterrichtsanalysen werden Schwierigkeiten aufgezeigt, die in der Lehreraus- und -fortbildung verstärkt berücksichtigt werden sollten.

Chants im fremdsprachlichen Frühbeginn der Grundschule.,"Der Autor macht auf die Notwendigkeit aufmerksam, im frühbeginnenden Fremdsprachenunterricht auf andere Methoden zurückzugreifen, die entwicklungspsychologisch für diese Lerngruppe relevanter sind. So sollte seiner Ansicht nach vor allem mit visuellen Unterrichtsmitteln, Gestik und Mimik gearbeitet werden und die noch nicht durch übermäßiges Fehlerbewußtsein beeinträchtigte Spontanität und Sprechbereitschaft der jungen Lerner für entsprechende Lernaktivitäten ausgenutzt werden. Er macht einen Vorschlag, wie chants in der Grundschule vielfältig eingesetzt werden können.",0
Konzentrations- und Wahrnehmungstraining im Unterrichtsfach Englisch.,"Unter den zahlreichen Bedingungsfaktoren für ein erfolgreiches schulisches Lernen werden in der einschlägigen Literatur auch die Konzentrationstüchtigkeit und die Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit genannt. Daraus lässt sich der unterrichtliche Auftrag ableiten, den die Schule zu leisten hat. Systematisches Konzentrations- und Wahrnehmungstraining als Grundprinzip allen Lernens. Diese Aufgabe kann keinesfalls als singulärer Unterrichtsgegenstand isoliert verwirklicht werden. Sie ist vielmehr von allen Fächern verantwortungsvoll zu übernehmen. Wie dies nun im Bereich einer Fremdsprache aussehen könnte, sollen die folgenden Ausführungen andeuten. Die Möglichkeiten für ein bewusstes Konzentrations- und Wahrnehmungstraining sind äußerst vielfältig, weshalb aus Platzgründen eine rigorose Einschränkung auf die vier folgenden Bereiche vorgenommen wurde: - Konzentrations- und Wahrnehmungstraining beim Hörverstehen; - Wahrnehmungstraining für orthographisch-phonologische Beziehungen; - Wahrnehmungstraining für grammatische Regularitäten; - Konzentrationstraining für handlungsorientierte Verfahren.

"""Butterfly Project"". Ein neuer Englisch-Schulversuch in Tirol: Englisch ab der Grundstufe I.","Der Schulversuch ""Butterfly Project"" wird seit dem Schuljahr 1992/93 in Tirol durchgefuehrt. Die Vermittlung der englischen Sprache erfolgt als integrierter Bestandteil des Gesamtunterrichts im Umfang einer Wochenstunde, aufgeteilt in ca. drei bis zehn Minuten taeglich. Um dem Prinzip der Anschaulichkeit gerecht zu werden, wird der einsprachig erteilte Unterricht mit dem Einsatz geeigneter Medien (z. B. Flash-cards, Bilder, Handpuppen, Poster, Lernspiele, Story-books) unterstuetzt. Eine Puppe oder ein Stofftier fungiert als Bezugsobjekt zwischen Lehrer und Schuelern. Ein Schwerpunkt ist die Vermittlung des Hoerverstehens und der richtigen Aussprache, die erwiesenermassen im fruehen Kindesalter besonders leicht zu erwerben sind. Die Autorin gibt einige praktische Beispiele zu Liedern, Jazz Chants und aus dem Bereich der Leibeserziehung. (IFS).",0

Fremdsprachen in der Waldorfschule. Rudolf Steiners Konzept eines ganzheitlichen Fremdsprachen-Unterrichts.,"Bisher war es nicht einfach, an Informationen ueber den (fruehen) Fremdsprachenunterricht an Waldorfschulen heranzukommen. Es ist zwar bekannt, dass zwei Fremdsprachen gleichzeitig ab Klasse 1 auf dem Stundenplan stehen, aber Literatur zum didaktischen Konzept und zum praktischen Vorgehen waren nur schwer - wenn ueberhaupt - zugaenglich. Mit diesem Buch liegt nun die erste systematische Einfuehrung in die Vorstellungen des paedagogischen ""Vaters"" der Waldorfschulbewegung, Rudolf Steiner, vor, der sich schon 1919 fuer ein ganzheitliches Sprachenlernen eingesetzt hat und damit in mancherlei Hinsicht Vorstellungen verwirklichen wollte, die gegenwaertig im Zusammenhang mit den Zielen und Inhalten alternativer Methoden beim Fremdsprachenlernen erneut aufgegriffen werden. Steiners Ideen zur Sprachwissenschaft und die alternative Fremdsprachenbewegung basieren allerdings auf unterschiedlichen Voraussetzungen: so ist die anthroposophische Menschenkunde der Waldorfpaedagogik in weiten Teilen nur schwer oder gar nicht mit den Grundlagen wissenschaftlicher Disziplinen vereinbar, auf die sich z. B. die Suggestopaedie oder Vertreter holistischen Fremdsprachenlernens beziehen. Immerhin aber gibt es auf der Ebene der methodischen Realisierung viele Uebereinstimmungen: von der Betonung sinnlicher Wahrnehmungen ueber emotionale Aspekte und Koerperbewegung bis hin zur lernfoerdernden Rolle der Musik. Nicht nur Primarschullehrer koennen von der Lektuere dieses Buches profitieren und viele wertvolle Anregungen fuer ihren Unterrichtsalltag erhalten; auch Gymnasiallehrern vermag der Autor Anstoesse zum Weiterdenken zu vermitteln, sofern sie bereit sind, vertraute unterrichtliche Vorgehensweisen auch einmal in Frage zu stellen.",0
Pour un enseignement précoce du français: pédagogies et méthodologies. Franzoesisch in der Grundschule: paedagogische und methodische Ueberlegungen.,"Der deutsche wie der franzoesische Beitrag bemuehen sich um eine theoretische Fundierung des fruehen Fremdsprachenunterrichts, welcher eine Reihe von Gegebenheiten zu beruecksichtigen hat, deren Ignorierung erhebliche Probleme nach sich ziehen kann. Was versteht man eigentlich unter Fruehbeginn? Wie stellt sich den Schuelern die bilinguale Situation dar? Mit welchen institutionellen Vorgaben muessen sich Lehrer wie Schueler auseinandersetzen? Einig sind sich die Autoren im Hinblick auf eine kindgerechte Methodologie, die sich der Geschichte, des Liedes, des Spiels bedient, um das ""Prinzip Freude"" im Unterricht zur Geltung zu bringen. Der deutsche Beitrag bescheinigt dem fruehen Fremdsprachenunterricht eine Mittelstellung zwischen natuerlichem Spracherwerb und schulischem Fremdsprachenunterricht. Er zeigt, dass pro Unterrichtseinheit nicht mehr als drei Wortschatzeinheiten dauerhaft verankert werden koennen. Die vorgeschlagene, als kognitive Progression bezeichnete Abfolge von Fragewoertern im Unterrichtsverlauf orientiert sich an einer universellen Sequenz beim Spracherwerb.",0
"Richtig kombiniert, Dr. Watson oder: Der Lernende als Detektiv. Zur Arbeit mit (Kriminal-)Hoerspielen im Fremdsprachenunterricht.","Die Verfasser vergleichen den Sprachlerner scherzhaft mit einem Detektiv, der Vermutungen anstellt, vom Bekannten auf Unbekanntes schliesst ... er soll ein Sherlock Holmes der Hoertexte werden. Dazu eigenen sich sehr gut (Kriminal-)Hoerspiele, die auch durch die Komponente Geraeusche und Musik Spannungsmomente bieten. Zum Einsatz von Hoerspielen im Unterricht zeichnen die Verfasser einige Prinzipien auf wie: Segmentierung, Kontrolluebungen, die Aktivierung der Schueler durch Sprechen ueber das Gehoerte, Notizenmachen. Beispiele zu dem Hoerspiel ""Das Telefonspiel"" verdeutlichen den unterrichtlichen Umgang mit einem Kriminalhoerspiel. Die erste Aufgabe ist die Einschaetzung der handelnden Personen durch die Schueler, wichtige Informationen werden festgehalten auf einem Arbeitsblatt, das im Aufsatz mit zu beantwortenden Verstaendnisfragen teilweise abgedruckt ist. Wesentliche Szenen werden mehrmals gehoert und von Uebungen begleitet. Kriterien fuer die Auswahl passender Hoerspiele finden sich als Textabschluss.",0
Vom Ruebenziehen.

Handeln wurde hier zweifach angewendet, als Spiel und in Bastelarbeiten. Die Verfasserin schildert den Unterrichtsverlauf mit dem Herstellen der Spielermasken sowie dem Erarbeiten neuer Lexik durch Benennen der Hilfsmittel und der verschiedenen Maerchengestalten. Jede Person wird charakterisiert, und sie bekommt ihren Spieltext. Das ""Ruebenschauspiel"" sowie das Lied ""Die Ruebe"" sind auf einem Arbeitsblatt wiedergegeben.",0
"Waldorfschulen, oder die Erfahrung von mehr als 70 Jahren im fruehen Fremdsprachenunterricht.","Der Ansatz der Waldorfpaedagogik Rudolf Steiners zum fruehen Fremdsprachenlernen des Kindes ist sehr viel aelter als alle heutigen Bestrebungen in dieser Richtung. Seit der Gruendung der ersten Waldorfschule im Jahre 1919 legte der auf anthropologischen Gesichtspunkten erstellte Lehrplan fest, dass alle Kinder ab dem ersten Schuljahr zwei lebende Sprachen lernen sollten. Der Verfasser zitiert eine Reihe naeherer Begruendungen hierzu aus den paedagogischen Werken Rudolf Steiners. Die Nachahmungsfaehigkeit des Kindes ist bis zum 10. Lebensjahr besonders ausgepraegt, ebenso der Sinn fuer Rhythmus, Poesie, Spiel und Lied. Der Stundenaufbau an einer Waldorfschule wird dargestellt, in welcher Weise das Wort an die Dinge und Taetigkeiten geknuepft wird, evident gemacht. Nicht Nuetzlichkeitserwaegungen stehen im Mittelpunkt, sondern der paedagogisch-menschenkundliche Gesichtspunkt ist ausschlaggebend. Dieser fruehe Fremdsprachenunterricht hat als Bestandteil der Erziehung des ganzen Menschen und als ein Beitrag zur Ausbildung seiner gesamten geistig-seelischen Kraefte - im Fuehlen, Wollen und Denken - seine Berechtigung.",0
Fremdsprachen in der Grundschule.

Der Autor untersucht zunaechst den gesellschaftlichen Bezugsrahmen fuer die Fremdsprachen im Elementar- und Primarbereich und nimmt dabei besonders Bezug auf die Bedeutung der franzoesischen Sprachkenntnisse in der Bundesrepublik. Nachdem er die institutionellen Bedingungen geklaert hat, stellt er in drei Kapiteln, in denen die neuesten Forschungsergebnisse rezipiert werden, den entwicklungspsychologischen, den psycholinguistischen und den linguistischen Bezugsrahmen vor. Lernziele, Inhalte und Methoden der Sprachvermittlung auf der Primarstufe sind ein zentrales Kapitel der Untersuchung, an das sich eine Uebersicht ueber Medien und moegliche Lernerfolgskontrollen und, nicht zu vergessen, eine Liste mit Ausdruecken fuer die Interaktion zwischen Sprachvermittlern und Sprachlernern fuer Englisch und Franzoesisch anschliesst.

Fremdsprachen in der Grundschule!?,"Wenn man davon ausgeht, dass Europa in der Grundschule beginnt, bedarf es paedagogischer Konzeptionen, die interkulturelles Lernen, Foerderung von Mehrsprachigkeit sowie eine europaeische Dimension von Bildungsinhalten einbeziehen. Da erwiesen ist, dass bereits Grundschueler in ihrer inner- und ausserschulischen Erfahrungswelt fremdsprachige Woerter verwenden, ist es moeglich, ab dem 3. Lernjahr fremdsprachige Unterrichtsphasen zu integrieren. Hinsichtlich einzelner paedagogischer Zielvorstellungen bleiben zur Zeit noch Fragen offen. Beobachtungen und Erfahrungen der ""Begegnung mit einer Fremdsprache"" (Englisch) in Nordrhein-Westfalen seit vier Jahren haben aber u. a. gezeigt, dass die Schueler eine erhoehte sprachliche Sensibilitaet zeigen, aufgeschlossener und toleranter sind im Umgang mit deutschen und auslaendischen Kindern sowie keine Beruehrungsaengste zeigen im Hinblick auf neue Faecher.",0
Fruehbeginn Englisch - vor mehr als 10 Jahren. Erfahrungen von Gestern fuer Morgen.,"Vor dem Hintergrund der europaeischen Integration erhaelt schulischer Fremdsprachenunterricht eine neue Dimension. In diesem Zusammenhang ist der Stellenwert des Fruehbeginns hervorzuheben, wobei hier Erfahrungen beschrieben werden, die bereits in den siebziger Jahren gesammelt wurden, aber dennoch fuer die Zukunft relevant bleiben. Es handelte sich dabei um ein Angebot der Volkshochschule fuer einen Fruehbeginn mit Englisch fuer Kinder des dritten und vierten Schuljahres. Beschrieben wird die sprachpraktische Arbeit, fuer die insgesamt pro Semester ca. zwoelf Stunden (jeweils 45 Minuten) zur Verfuegung standen. Der Unterricht war sehr auf die Beduerfnisse und die Erfahrungswelt der Kinder abgestimmt und ueberwiegend kommunikativ orientiert (im allgemeinen 12 bis 15 Teilnehmer). Einbezogen wurden vor allem auch motivierende Aktivitaeten wie Singen, Malen, Spielen, das Erlernen kleiner Reime und Sprueche. Bereichert wurde der Unterricht durch die Begegnung mit Native Speakers. Nach neun Jahren musste das Projekt infolge intensiver Gegenpropaganda seitens einiger Englischlehrer weiterfuehrender Schulen eingestellt werden. Als Ergebnis bleibt aber festzuhalten, dass eine relativ grosse Anzahl von Kindern fruehzeitig die Gelegenheit wahrgenommen hat, neben der eigenen Sprache eine andere zu lernen. Die Kinder sind fuer das Erlernen weiterer Sprachen motiviert worden und haben ihren Horizont erweitert - wichtige Voraussetzungen fuer das Zusammenwachsen Europas.",0

Die Methodik des beim Franzoesischunterricht in den Grundschulklassen benutzten Lehrwerkes ""Viens voir"" unterscheidet sich von herkoemmlichen Materialien vor allem dadurch, dass sie persoenlichkeitsbezogen, kreativ (musische Elemente bilden einen grossen Teil der Unterrichtsaktivitaeten) und kommunikativ ausgerichtet ist, aber auf eine linguistische und sprachfunktionale Progression verzichtet, so dass jede Unterrichtsstunde eine in sich geschlossene Einheit bildet.",0
Fremdsprachenunterricht zwischen Sprachenpolitik und Praxis. Festschrift fuer Herbert Christ zum 60. Geburtstag.,"Aus Anlass des 60. Geburtstages von Herbert Christ wurde der Band von Schuelern, Freunden und Kollegen zusammengestellt, wobei besonders der Grundueberzeugung des Jubilars Rechnung getragen wurde, dass Fremdsprachenunterricht eine massgebliche politische Dimension einnimmt. Im Hinblick auf die europaeische Integration, die ein organisatorisches und inhaltliches Ueberdenken des Fremdsprachenunterrichts erforderlich macht, befasst sich der erste Teil mit dem Thema ""Sprachenpolitik"", wobei in verschiedenen Beitraegen kuenftige Anforderungen an einen Fremdsprachenunterricht beschrieben werden (z. B. Picht, Robert: ""Ausbildung fuer die internationale Zusammenarbeit. Fragen zum Stellenwert der Allgemeinbildung fuer wirtschaftlich-technologische Kooperation""; Zapp, Josef: ""Sprachenvielfalt - Stolperstein fuer Europa""; Freudenstein, Reinhold: ""Fremdsprachen in der Schule nach 1992.

Fremdsprachenunterricht im Wandel. Lieselotte Weidner zum 65. Geburtstag.,"Seit den 50er Jahren erfuhr die Fremdsprachendidaktik einen immer rascheren Wandel, der die Entwicklung neuer Lehr- und Lernformen foerderte. Andreas Digeser (""Fremdsprachendidaktik im Umbruch"", S.10 - 24) zeigt diese Veraenderungen auf, geht auf die gegenwaertige Situation ein und plaediert fuer eine ""wohldurchdachte Strukturenprogression"" unter Zuhilfenahme bewaehrter kognitiver Methoden, betont jedoch die Wichtigkeit des unverkrampften authentischen Sprachgebrauchs. Renate Loeffler (""Bewegung - Koerper - Sinne: Ein Beitrag zum ganzheitlichen Lernen im Englischunterricht"", S. 25 - 34) verbindet Prinzipien der humanistischen Paedagogik mit Erkenntnissen aus der Hirnforschung und stellt ganzheitlich-affektive Uebungsbeispiele und Entspannungstechniken fuer den Englischunterricht vor. Einen Ueberblick ueber Veraenderungen in der angewandten Linguistik und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Fremdsprachendidaktik gibt Johannes-Peter Timm (""Wandlungen im Selbstverstaendnis eines Angewandten Linguisten"", S. 35 - 42). In ""Fremdsprachen im Spannungsfeld von Schule, Ausbildung und Beruf"" (S. 43 - 53) wird von Gerhard Bach die Wichtigkeit der Orientierung des handlungsorientierten Unterrichts an der ausserschulischen Praxis aufgezeigt. Das noch wenig populaere kollokationale Lernen stellt Hartmut Breitkreuz in ""Kollokationales Lernen im Englischunterricht am Beispiel von group terms und collective nouns"" (S. 55 - 66) sowohl theoretisch als auch praxisbezogen vor. ""Praktische Vorschlaege zur Ueberwindung der Lehrbuchdominaz"" geben Roland Gaessler und Katharina Wenner-Nogueira (""Wer plant den Fremdsprachenunterricht?"", S. 67 - 81), veranschaulicht durch mehrere Beispiele aus dem Franzoesischunterricht. Heidemarie Zeidler widmet sich der negativen und veraltet-stereotypisierten Darstellung der englischen Kueche in Lehrbuechern fuer den Englischunterricht sowie der verwirrenden Komplexitaet von Mahlzeitenbezeichnungen in England und Amerika (""Kulinarisches in Englischwerken der 70er und 80er Jahre"", S. 82 - 93). Auf das Auftreten von ""false friends"" nicht nur in der Gemein-, sondern auch in der Fachsprache gehen Hartmut Breitkreuz und Nicole Wiegand (""Zur Problematik gemein- und fachsprachlicher False Friends"", S. 94 - 110) ein. Abschliessend schlaegt Manfred Liedtke die Exkursion im Anglistikstudium (""Die Exkursion als hochschuldidaktische Aufgabe im Englischstudium"" (S. 111 - 119) als Bestandteil des Englischstudiums vor und geht auf ihre Organisationsstruktur ein.

Doodie. Ein Lehrwerk fuer die Fremdsprachliche Vorschulung Englisch in zwei Baenden.,"Das Lehrwerk wurde fuer die dritte und vierte Grundschulklasse in Oesterreich konzipiert und besteht insgesamt aus zwei Schuelerbuechern, zwei diesen zugeordneten ""Activities""-Heften sowie zwei Lehrerbegleitbaenden. Aus lernpsychologischer Sicht ist der fruehzeitige Erwerb einer Fremdsprache besonders guenstig aufgrund der Faehigkeit des unbefangenen Spracherwerbs sowie der Imitationsfreudigkeit in dieser Phase. Bei der Konzeption der Schuelerbuecher wurde diesen Ueberlegungen Rechnung getragen und der Unterricht als spielerisches Lernen aufgefasst. Die Motivation der Kinder wird noch dadurch gesteigert, dass auf Leistungskontrollen verzichtet wird. Die in den Buechern anhand relativ grosser und farbiger Illustrationen praesentierten Szenen schliessen unmittelbar an die Erlebniswelt des Kindes an, sind somit leicht nachvollziehbar und regen zur Versprachlichung an. Auch das Spielen, Singen, Malen und Sich-Bewegen soll stets in den Unterricht mit einbezogen werden. Vorrangiges Lernziel ist der Erwerb kommunikativer Kompetenz ebenso wie der Hoerverstehensfaehigkeit, waehrend das Schreiben und Lesen zunaechst eher eine nachgeordnete Rolle spielen. Die Lehrerbegleitbaende enthalten wertvolle Hinweise und Anregungen fuer den Umgang mit dem Lehrwerk. Zusaetzlich werden Tonkassetten mit mehr als 50 Liedern, Reimen, Raetseln, Uebungen etc. angeboten.",0

Franzoesisch in der Grundschule.,"Das speziell fuer die Grundschule konzipierte Lehrwerk ist insgesamt sehr umfangreich und besteht neben dem Schuelerarbeitsbuch aus Lehrerband sowie separaten Baenden mit Arbeitsboegen, Spielen, Marionetten- und Puppenspielen, Liedern und Reimen (letzterer in Vorbereitung). Das Angebot unterscheidet sich insofern von anderen Lehrwerken, als konsequent auf eine linguistische Progession verzichtet und statt dessen das Schwergewicht auf thematische, psychologische und methodische Aspekte gelegt wurde. Dabei wird nicht nur kreatives Lernen, sondern vor allem kreatives Lehren gefordert. Es soll der Versuch unternommen werden, die bisher in den Schulen praktizierte unilinguale und unikulturelle Fixierung zu ueberwinden und moeglichst fruehzeitig in Situationen zu lernen, d. h. z. B. in Austauschprogrammen (vgl. das Partnerschafts- und Begegnungsprogramm ""Lerne die Sprache des Nachbarn"" zwischen Frankreich und Baden-Wuerttemberg). Nach Auffassung der Autoren sollte sich die Verwendung der vielfaeltigen Materialien (die durchaus auch im Anfangsunterricht der Klassen fuenf und sechs eingesetzt werden koennen) an bestimmten Kriterien orientieren: persoenlichkeitsbezogen, kreativ, kommunikativ, punktuell und spielorientiert. Bei Beachtung dieser Aspekte kann der besonderen Lerndisposition von Kindern dieser Altersstufe am besten Rechnung getragen werden, denn ""Motivation ist alles"" - ""Ermuedung ist stets zu vermeiden"".",0
Interkulturelle Beziehungen als Gegenstand des Fremdsprachenunterrichts.,"Da der Fremdsprachenunterricht nicht ohne die Thematisierung interkultureller Beziehungen auskommt, nennt der Autor drei Kriterienbuendel, die sich bei der Strukturierung des Gegenstandsbereichs als hilfreich erweisen koennen: 1. Dem Schueler soll Gelegenheit zu der Einsicht gegeben werden, dass etwas als fremd Empfundenes verstanden und damit potentiell Konflikttraechtiges aufgeloest werden kann; 2. Als ein weiterer Steuerungsfaktor bietet sich lernerzentriertes Vorgehen an, das jedoch nicht bei Chanson oder Pop-Song stehen bleibt, in fruehen Unterrichtsphasen dagegen das Klischee nicht scheut; 3. Lehrerzentriertheit des landeskundlichen Unterrichts legitimiert sich aus der Tatsache, dass sich Lehrer bestimmte Regionen des Zielsprachenlandes auf eigene Kosten erarbeiten muessen und damit fuer eine auch touristisch gefaerbte Erlebnisqualitaet ihres Unterrichts sorgen.",0
Englisch in der Grundschule. Darstellung eines Unterrichtsversuchs.,"In einer Grundschule im Landkreis Hildesheim wurde eine 4. Klasse sechs Wochen lang mit zwei Wochenstunden zu je 45 Minuten in Englisch unterrichtet. Der Artikel haelt als uebergeordnetes, pragmatisch ausgerichtetes Lehrziel fest, dass sich die Schueler an den vorgegebenen, erweiterungsfaehigen fremdsprachlichen Situationen ""aktiv-muendlich/ reproduktiv"" beteiligen sollten. Die dem Schulversuch zugrundeliegende stoffliche Zusammenstellung ist, gegliedert in die Bereiche Strukturen und Lexik, Lieder sowie Landeskunde, aufgelistet. Beschrieben wird auch der Aufbau einzelner Unterrichtsstunden sowie die dabei verwendeten Medien und Arbeitsmittel. Die Auswertung am Schluss des Unterrichtsversuchs, an der auch die Eltern beteiligt wurden, ergab ein ueberwiegend positives Bild, aber auch Hinweise fuer moegliche Verbesserungen vor allem im Bereich der Diskriminationsschulung.",0
Unterrichtsmodelle - erprobt: Arbeitsmaterialien fuer die Hauptschule. 5. Jgst. 2. Englisch.,"Es werden fuenf Unterrichtseinheiten vorgestellt, die M. Sitzmann entworfen und erprobt hat: 1. Opening day at the sports centre. 2. Let's learn a song: ""If you're happy"". 3. Telling the way to a stranger. 4. Strukturarbeit: A penfriend. 5. Wortschatzarbeit: Koerperteile. Zu jeder Einheit werden die Lernziele benannt und der Unterrichtsverlauf (Zeit, Methode, Stoff, Kommentar) geschildert. Die mitgelieferten Arbeitsblaetter duerfen kopiert werden.",0
Vermittlung von Deutsch als Zweitsprache in den Lernbereichen des Sachunterrichts.,"Erweiterung des Sprachschatzes um zentrale Begriffe (Nomen, Adjektive usw.) wie Wohnhaus, Geschaeft, Geschaeftshaus, Fenster, Schaufenster, Tuer, Etage, Dach; Erkennen grammatikalischer Gesetzmaessigkeiten oder Besonderheiten (Singular/Plural, zusammengesetzte Hauptwoerter, Satzstruktur); Aufbau und Funktion von Haeusern. Unterrichtsgegenstand: Wortschatzerweiterung zum Themenbereich 'Haeuser'.",0
Arbeit fuer das Fach Englisch - Hauptschule Klasse 6.,"Die Klassenarbeit soll nicht das alleinige Zuweisungskriterium zu A- bzw. B-Kurse, sondern eine Orientierungshilfe fuer die Beurteilung des Leistungsstandes darstellen. Die Punktezuordnung und der mitgelieferte Notenschluessel sollen als unverbindlicher Vorschlag einer Arbeitsgruppe angesehen werden. Der Kommunikationswert einer Aussage wird ueberwiegend gezaehlt, d. h. Rechtschreibfehler, die den Sinn der Aussage entstellen, werden durch Punktabzug beurteilt. Ausgehend von einem englischen Text, der den Dialog von einem Jungen mit dem Besitzer eines Tiergeschaefts ueber den Kauf eines Hundes, wird zuerst durch Ankreuzen des richtigen Satzes festgestellt, ob der Text inhaltlich verstanden wurde. Weiterhin wird das Einsetzen von Praepositionen im Ankreuzverfahren getestet, dann sollen Fragen zur vorgegebenen Antwort eingesetzt werden. Im folgenden sollen Schueler durch Ausfuellen der freigelassenen Stellen die Singular-, Plural-, Zeit-, Voll- und Verlaufsformen der Verben ihr Koennen unter Beweis stellen. Erklaerendes Bildmaterial lockert den Test auf. Unterrichtsgegenstand: Eine Klassenarbeit in der 6. Hauptschulklasse.",0

"Burnout in a cheerful environment: Student stress survey in early childhood teacher education program, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia.","Stress during an academic journey is very common among students. From the perspective of school psychology, students' stress could have two contradictory effects. On the one hand, stress could play a motivating role for success. On the other hand it could also sabotage the students' learning. Early detection of stress is vital to navigating situations that can perpetuate student burnout. Early childhood teacher education (ECTE) curriculum involves a lot of music and art classes. The learning environment is also built on fun learning principles that are the core of early childhood education. Exposure to fun learning principles and activities does not prevent students from experiencing stress. This study surveys potential tension in the learning environment of ECTE program, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. It surveyed 49 students of the class of 2014-16 using questionnaires. The result shows that 60% of students experienced burnout. The symptoms that they experienced were loss of motivation and cognitive exhaustion. This research also identifies factors by which the students felt the most pressure. Lack of English language proficiency and the high financial cost of study are perceived to be the most significant causes of students' stress leading to burnout.

Assessment tools in music therapy studies with children and adolescents in German-speaking countries. An overview.,"One problem in music therapy research is the methodology used in efficacy evaluation. Well-established scales and specific assessment tools are needed for measuring effects and evaluating therapeutic processes. This paper presents a systematic literature review of assessment tools used with children and adolescents addressing following research questions: a) Which assessment tools were used? b) What are their quality criteria? Music therapy studies in German-speaking countries with children and adolescents (0-18 Y/A, published 2000-2016) were included resulting in 28 studies including grey literature (n = 22). Thirty-five assessment tools (questionnaires, tests, scales, interviews) were applied, 12 were ad hoc-based or modified tools, 23 were standardized and tested for objectivity, 18 of which for reliability and 7 also for validity. Assessment tools from other fields (n = 21) have been psychometrically examined more extensively than music therapy tools (n = 14). Particularly for observational methods the necessity of trained raters became apparent as well as the importance of psychometric evaluation and standardization of newly developed assessment tools. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)     Abstract (German)     Ein Problem musiktherapeutischer Forschung ist die Methodik fur Wirkungsnachweise. Zur Messung von Effekten und der Beurteilung des musiktherapeutischen Prozesses werden neben etablierten Skalen spezifisch musiktherapeutische Untersuchungsinstrumente (UI) benotigt. Diese Arbeit liefert eine Ubersicht verwendeter UI im Kinder- und Jugendbereich. Forschungsfragen sind: a) Welche UI werden angewendet? b) Wie ist deren Qualitat in Bezug auf psychometrische Gutekriterien? Zunachst wurde eine systematische Literaturrecherche im deutschsprachigen Raum von musiktherapeutischen Studien mit Kindern und Jugendlichen (0-18 LJ, erschienen 2000-2016) durchgefuhrt. Inkludiert wurden 28 Studien, davon 22 graue Literatur mit insgesamt 35 verwendeten UI (Fragebogen, Tests, Skalen, Interviews), davon 14 musiktherapeutische. Von 35 UI waren 12 ad hoc entwickelt oder modifiziert, 23 standardisiert und objektiv, davon 18 hinsichtlich Reliabilitat, sieben auch auf Validitat uberpruft. Fachfremde UI wurden psychometrisch umfangreicher untersucht als musiktherapeutische Verfahren. Ausblickend sind Trainings fur die korrekte Anwendung insbesondere von Beobachtungsverfahren notwendig, sowie die psychometrische Uberprufung und Standardisierung neu entwickelter UI.

The original article has been updated. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-10909-001). Massive Multiple Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) have increased in popularity among children, juveniles, and adults since MMORPGs' appearance in this digital age. MMORPGs can be applied to enhancing language learning, which is drawing researchers' attention from different fields and many studies have validated MMORPGs' positive effect on language learning. However, there are few studies on the underlying behavioral or neural mechanism of such effect. This paper reviews the educational application of the MMORPGs based on relevant macroscopic and microscopic studies, showing that gamers' overall language proficiency or some specific language skills can be enhanced by real-time online interaction with peers and game narratives or instructions embedded in the MMORPGs. Mechanisms underlying the educational assistant role of MMORPGs in second language learning are discussed from both behavioral and neural perspectives. We suggest that attentional bias makes gamers/learners allocate more cognitive resources toward task-related stimuli in a controlled or an automatic way. Moreover, with a moderating role played by activation of reward circuit, playing the MMORPGs may strengthen or increase functional connectivity from seed regions such as left anterior insular/frontal operculum (AI/FO) and visual word form area to other language-related brain areas.

"Adolescentes, smartphones y consumo de audio digital en la era de Spotify.","The consolidation of smartphones as dominant devices for access to digital information and entertainment has redefined the processes of production and commercialization of cultural communication industries. The nature of these screens, which prioritize the visual content over the sound, decisively influences distribution strategies in the audio market: radio operators, streaming music platforms and podcast creators need to adapt their value chains to the habits derived from this mediation, especially in the younger audience. This research identifies the practices of mobile use as an audio receiver among adolescents in Colombia, Spain and Mexico -the most representative countries of Spanish-speaking digital sound consumption- based on a descriptive study on a thousand subjects from 13 to 19 years of age. The results confirm the overwhelming dominance in this music menu in the face of low penetration of radio and podcast word content. The selection is based on personal criteria, with little margin for the prescription of family or friends. There is evidence of the roots of individual listening, linked to the brand and the visibility of audio providers, who are obliged to develop diffusion logics based not only on thematic or genre preferences, but also on the user experience.

Music therapy in neonatal care: A framework for German-speaking countries and Switzerland.,"Music therapy in neonatal care reflects a growing area of interdisciplinary interest. But how exactly is best practice in neonatal music therapy characterized? Initial guidelines already exist, but the question regarding relevance they have for the German-speaking region remains, in light of possible specific cultural issues and clinical experiences. The Fachkreis Musiktherapie Neonatologie (FMtN), a professional circle of German speaking neonatal music therapists, has aimed to address these questions by developing an overall framework from the three approaches typical of this region: (1) recorded maternal voice, (2) live vocal and (3) live instrumental music therapy. The group has synthesized its members' practical clinical expertise with the best available evidence, guidelines in neonatal music therapy and German guidelines for individualized developmental neonatal care. The paper presents a framework including overall objectives, (contra-) indications and methods independent of the specific approach used. It supplements existing guidelines with culturally sensitive requirements such as minimizing the music stimulation by mainly humming, in infant applications. This framework may serve as a model for music therapists to offer culturally relevant best practice interventions and to better position themselves among various related disciplines.

Translation of the Healthy-Unhealthy Uses of Music Scale (HUMS) from English into German.,"Music is an essential part of everyday life in adolescents. It especially supports their development of identity and plays an important role in mood regulation. In recent years there is a growing interest regarding the interrelations between music and mental health, particularly in the context of prevention. Therefore, Saarikallio, Gold and McFerran developed the Healthy-Unhealthy Music Scale (HUMS). It assesses adolescents' engagement in music and whether they perceive their music as being helpful or not. As a result, HUMS serves as an indicator for mental well-being or for proneness to depression in adolescents from the perspective of musical behavior. In order to make HUMS accessible to German-speaking countries, a translation of the questionnaire was made (HUMS-DE). This article describes the translation process of HUMS-DE, applying TRAPD method and back-translation, and discusses its possible applications for music therapy research and practice.

Dyslexic characteristics of Chinese-speaking semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia.,"Reading disorder is a recognized feature in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Surface dyslexia, characterized by regularization errors, is typically seen in the English-speaking semantic variant of PPA (svPPA). However, dyslexic characteristics of other languages, particularly logographical languages such as Chinese, remain sparse in the literature. This study aims to characterize and describe the dyslexic pattern in this group of patients by comparing an English-speaking svPPA group with a Chinese-speaking svPPA group. The authors hypothesized that Chinese-speaking individuals with svPPA would likely commit fewer surface dyslexic errors. By accessing the database of Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center of the United States, the authors identified three Chinese speaking and 18 English-speaking patients with svPPA, respectively, for comparison. The results suggest that, instead of surface dyslexia, svPPA in Chinese-speaking individuals is characterized by a profound deep dyslexic error. Based on current evidence suggesting the role of the temporal pole as a semantic convergence center, the authors conclude that this region also mediates and converges lexical-semantic significance in logographical languages.

Generalist and specialist primary music teachers' uses of nonverbal and verbal support during music practice.,"Skilled music teachers are adept in facilitating their students' musical practice with nonverbal and verbal support-performances. Whereas previous studies have investigated cognitive concepts of generalist primary music teachers, this research uses a video-based observational method in order to identify durations, perceived accuracy of German primary music teachers' music practice, and the perceived quality of their support-performances. The results show that students of specialist teachers practice significantly more on tuned instruments than do students of generalist music teachers. Furthermore, specialist teachers used significantly more nonverbal approaches and gestures and they verbalized significantly more rhythmic solfege syllables and instructions in their support-performances than generalist music teachers. The group of specialist music teachers' singing and playing rhythms was rated as being significantly more accurate than that of the group of generalist music teachers, and the specialists' quality of support-performances was rated as significantly more helpful to facilitate musical learning among students, compared with the group of generalists' support-performances. Despite the limited number of video-based data of primary music lessons in German schools, these findings indicate the need for further professional development of generalist teachers, for example, to enhance their music practice training, to increase their diagnostic knowledge, and to extend their repertoire of methods to support students in learning music (support-performances). Further research could specifically focus on how music teachers efficiently use verbal and nonverbal support-performances to teach their students the practical aspects of music.

"""Limits on monolingualism? A comparison of monolingual and bilingual infants' abilities to integrate lexical tone in novel word learning"": Corrigendum.","Reports an error in ""Limits on monolingualism? A comparison of monolingual and bilingual infants' abilities to integrate lexical tone in novel word learning"" by Leher Singh, Felicia L. S. Poh and Charlene S. L. Fu (Frontiers in Psychology, 2016[May][10], Vol 7[667]). In the original article, Figures 3, 4 were switched. Figure 3 displays the results of Experiment 1 (Mandarin-English bilingual infants) and Figure 4 displays the results of Experiment 2 (Mandarin monolingual infants). Corrected figures are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-39378-001). To construct their first lexicon, infants must determine the relationship between native phonological variation and the meanings of words. This process is arguably more complex for bilingual learners who are often confronted with phonological conflict: phonological variation that is lexically relevant in one language may be lexically irrelevant in the other. In a series of four experiments, the present study investigated English-Mandarin bilingual infants' abilities to negotiate phonological conflict introduced by learning both a tone and a non-tone language. In a novel word learning task, bilingual children were tested on their sensitivity to tone variation in English and Mandarin contexts. Their abilities to interpret tone variation in a language-dependent manner were compared to those of monolingual Mandarin learning infants. Results demonstrated that at 12-13 months, bilingual infants demonstrated the ability to bind tone to word meanings in Mandarin, but to disregard tone variation when learning new words in English. In contrast, monolingual learners of Mandarin did not show evidence of integrating tones into word meanings in Mandarin at the same age even though they were learning a tone language. However, a tone discrimination paradigm confirmed that monolingual Mandarin learning infants were able to tell these tones apart at 12-13 months under a different set of conditions. Later, at 17-18 months, monolingual Mandarin learners were able to bind tone variation to word meanings when learning new words. Our findings are discussed in terms of cognitive adaptations associated with bilingualism that may ease the negotiation of phonological conflict and facilitate precocious uptake of certain properties of each language.

The second great awakening and American educational reform: Insights from the biography of John Milton Gregory.,"This chapter discusses the American educational reform by presenting insights from the biography of John Milton Gregory. School attendance in America at the beginning of the nineteenth century was undemocratic. Poor and working-class households could not afford the loss of a potential worker. Children would often work at home or be hired out. Children of slaves were not schooled at all. Further, the subjects taught in school were limited. Young boys and girls who attended the common school would learn reading, writing, spelling, and arithmetic. In some towns, nine- or ten-year-old boys could attend a grammar school, where they learned English grammar, Latin, Greek, history, geography, and mathematics. Older girls as well as older boys might attend an academy, where they could learn whatever the teacher was prepared to teach, but early academies generally limited girls to coursework in composition, music and art. A few young, privileged white men could attend college to prepare for a career in the ministry or law. This picture would change dramatically by the end of the nineteenth century, when education would become more practical and increasingly, if not yet equally, accessible to all. What caused the change in practicality and access? Scholars have found that following Thomas Jefferson, many supporters of public schools argued that democracy is best assured by an educated populace,' but another cause of the public school movement is frequently overlooked. A religious movement known as the Second Great Awakening surged through what is now the Eastern half of the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century. The first Great Awakening 100 years earlier focused on spiritual regeneration. It strengthened evangelical denominations such as Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The second wave had a social impact, generating popular support for temperance, the abolition of slavery, and other social reforms, including universal education. The relationship of the Second Great Awakening to the gradual realization of universal education in America can be explored through the life of John Milton Gregory.

"Learning, neural plasticity and sensitive periods: Implications for language acquisition, music training and transfer across the lifespan.","Sensitive periods in human development have often been proposed to explain age-related differences in the attainment of a number of skills, such as a second language (L2) and musical expertise. It is difficult to reconcile the negative consequence this traditional view entails for learning after a sensitive period with our current understanding of the brain's ability for experience-dependent plasticity across the lifespan. What is needed is a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying auditory learning and plasticity at different points in development. Drawing on research in language development and music training, this review examines not only what we learn and when we learn it, but also how learning occurs at different ages. First, we discuss differences in the mechanism of learning and plasticity during and after a sensitive period by examining how language exposure versus training forms language-specific phonetic representations in infants and adult L2 learners, respectively. Second, we examine the impact of musical training that begins at different ages on behavioral and neural indices of auditory and motor processing as well as sensorimotor integration. Third, we examine the extent to which childhood training in one auditory domain can enhance processing in another domain via the transfer of learning between shared neuro-cognitive systems. Specifically, we review evidence for a potential bi-directional transfer of skills between music and language by examining how speaking a tonal language may enhance music processing and, conversely, how early music training can enhance language processing. We conclude with a discussion of the role of attention in auditory learning for learning during and after sensitive periods and outline avenues of future research.

Music training and second-language English comprehension and vocabulary skills in Indian children.,"This study examined the second-language (L2) English abilities of musically trained and untrained primary school children. Participants were tested on the verbal subscales of the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC) and an English word-reading test. The musically trained participants performed significantly better on the tests of comprehension and vocabulary. This result is in line with the view that music and language share processing resources, as a result of which transfer of learning takes place. When the scores of participants with Indian Classical music training were compared with the scores of the untrained group, the comprehension and vocabulary advantage persisted, indicating that the L2 advantage was not simply an artefact of increased language familiarity that is likely to arise from Western music training.

David Bowsher (1925-2011).,"Presents an obituary of David Bowsher (1925-2011). He was an inquisitive boy who developed an early interest in poetry, languages and music, and also excelled in a number of sports. After winning a scholarship to study medicine in Cambridge he worked two years as a supplementary teacher before entering academia. He graduated from the medical school in 1950. After a couple of stints as a junior doctor in Manchester and Liverpool he received a fellowship in Human Anatomy at the University of Liverpool in 1952. A subsequent scholarship to spend over a year at Harvard Medical School determined much of his future career; it was there that he was introduced to neuroanatomy of pain, which remained his primary scientific focus throughout his career. Upon his return to Liverpool in 1956 he was appointed a Lecturer in Postgraduate Anatomy with a clinical attachment to the Walton Centre. He got his MD in 1960 and PhD in 1961, both from the University of Liverpool. His little textbook on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system ran into 5 English editions and a number of foreign translations. His specialization in Neurology secured him the position of Honorary Consultant Neurologist at the Walton Centre Pain Clinic in Liverpool in 1981-1995.In order to expand on his research skills he spent almost all of the 1960s as Professeur associe in Paris; later followed shorter research fellowships in Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. By 1970 he had published seminal papers on pain physiology either as a sole author or with colleagues in Brain, Nature, Lancet and other leading anatomical and neurological journals. Early on he became a respected member of the initially small, but rapidly growing scientific and clinical community interested in pain. His last paper was on the pathophysiology of congenital insensitivity to pain, published in 2009 (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Melodic versus intonational coding of communicative functions: A comparison of tonal contours in infant-directed song and speech.,"Global intonational contours of infant-directed speech are said to serve effective communicative functions. For example, steep rising contours are thought to arouse an infant while smoothly falling contours are thought to be soothing. Several researchers (e.g., Cordes, 2005; Papousek, 1996; Unyk, Trehub, Trainor, & Schellenberg, 1992) proposed that the melodic contours in nursery songs should follow the same communicative principles as in speech. In this study, melodic and intonational contours in play contexts were compared in three languages in order to determine 1) whether infant-directed speech and song are similar in the composition of their typical contours, and 2) whether there are differences across languages. Evidence from soothing contexts is also taken into account. The material was collected from 43 German-, French- and Russian-speaking parents singing or speaking to their 2- to 12- month-old infants. Tonal contour types in each register were assessed adopting protocols based on Cordes (2005). The results confirm the similarity between infant-directed speech and song in play contexts, but some differences occur in soothing contexts. Language-specific patterns are discussed, and it is put forward that it would be valuable to intensify research into the language-specific basis of infant-directed communication.

"Art for the sake of the corporation: Audi, BMW group, DaimlerChrysler, Montblanc, Siemens, and Volkswagen help explore the effect of sponsorship on corporate reputations.","This article examines whether exposure to a company's sponsorship of cultural activities such as ""high-brow"" arts-including classical music, literature, art exhibitions, and museums-provides a long-term increase in the general public's assessment of corporate reputation. As corporate reputation has been found by previous studies to be composed of two primary dimensions (i.e., the likeability of the firm, the competence of the firm), it is of particular interest to examine whether sponsorship of cultural events affects one or both of these dimensions. A two-dimensional model of image transfer is used as the theoretical basis for a study of more than 3,000 German consumers conducted in collaboration with 10 major multinational companies (e.g., BMW Group and Siemens). Results show that some significant effects of culture-sponsoring activities can be demonstrated for the likeability dimension of corporate reputation and some of its antecedents. However, no significant link between culture sponsorships and consumer perceptions of firm competence is found. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
The use of music therapy with children who speak English as a second language: An exploratory study.,"The following case examples present the use of music therapy with 6 Latino children who were learning English as a second language (ESL).

"Integrating environmental print across the curriculum, Prek-3: Making literacy instruction meaningful.","While learning to read and write takes time, there are effective ways to tap into what children already know and to use that information to jump start the literacy process. One way is through environmental print (EP), the print that surrounds children in their daily lives. This book provides a wealth of activities that build literacy skills during time devoted to language arts, math, science, social studies, art, and dramatic play. Highlighting research from the National Reading Panel, the authors demonstrate that, by activating prior knowledge and creating opportunities for authentic learning, EP is an effective tool in developing the early literacy skills of all children, including English language learners and those at risk for, or identified with, special needs. Each activity specifies grade range, materials, and instructions to help teachers (1) meet the goals of Early Reading First and Reading First; (2) assess children's ability levels in performing the activity; (3) strengthen concepts with related literature and songs; and (4) communicate ways that parents can use EP with their children.

A Closer Look at Gifted Children With Disabilities.,"Nine-year-old Stephen reads orchestral scores as he hums the music aloud in perfect tune. Reading musical scores is one of Stephens favorite activities, vying only with reading college-level computer programming manuals. At an age when most children are concentrating on fourth-grade arithmetic, Stephen has already earned a prize in music theory that is coveted by adults (Winner, 1998). Brian was prescribed Ritalin when he was young to assist in controlling his hyperactive behavior. He also received resource room support in grades 3 and 4. Currently, his sixth-grade teacher reports that distractibility and basic reading skills still pose problems for him, yet his WISC-R scores include a Verbal IQ of 118 and a Performance of 128 (Crawford & Snart, 1994). Brad does not have the motor control to paint, draw, or do geometric constructions, yet he did well in both art and geometry. He cannot speak, yet he attained As in both speech and French (Willard-Holt, 1998). Question: Which of these children are girted? Answer: All of them. These children are examples of individuals who are asynchronous or uneven in some aspect of their development. They defy the notion of what Winner (1998) termed ""global giftedness,"" a phrase that denotes ability or talent in all academic areas. In today's educational system, the myth of global giftedness is quite prevalent. While some students are talented in all academic areas, many more are not. Unevenness tends to be the rule rather than the exception. Thus, many children, due to a deficit in some aspect of development, are excluded from gifted programming--something many of them desperately need.

Linguistic Features and Strategies of Interpreting: From Research to Education to Practice.,"Educational interpreting is a genre of sign language interpreting that has been widely discussed (see Hurwitz, 1998; Jones, Clark, & Soltz, 1997; Seal, 1998). It is an area that is considered a specialty of sign language interpreters because of its unique approach to providing interpreting services for deaf people in the classroom, as opposed to within the educational ""milieu,"" which is more common within the spoken-language interpreting profession (e.g., between teachers and parents of children). Educational interpreting for deaf children has emerged as a need due to the philosophical shift in education toward integration and inclusion (Byrnes, Sigafoos, Rickards, & Brown, 2002). It is therefore common to find deaf children educated in local schools alongside their hearing counterparts, with support from interpreters and note-takers (Bowman & Hyde, 1993). Consequently, sign language interpreters are often found working in classrooms with deaf students, interpreting between the students and the teacher. Educational interpreters face different challenges when working with deaf children compared to deaf adults due to differing linguistic needs of deaf children (Schick, 2001), the specific interpreter competencies needed (Schick, Williams, & Bolster, 1999), ethical conflicts (Scheibe & Hoza, 1986), role confusion (Hayes, 1992), linguistic isolation (Storey & Jamieson, 2004), and occupational overuse injuries (DeCaro & Hurwitz, 1992). The introduction of antidiscrimination legislation in many Westernized countries has led to a specialized area of educational interpreting in the form of higher education interpreting. In many countries, deaf people are in a legal position to demand access to university education through interpreters. University interpreting has its own challenges. Several studies have explored the linguistic and communication issues in accessing higher education through sign language interpreters (Harrington, 2000, 2001; Johnson, 1991; Livingston, Singer, & Abrahamson, 1994; Locker, 1990). University interpreting places extra demands on interpreters, particularly in terms of the linguistic strategies they can employ in order to ensure that deaf students are accessing lecture content in the same way as hearing university students. Lang (2002) highlights the need for more research into higher education interpreting to further investigate the relationship between interpreting and learning. Due to the demands of this interpreting niche, there is a need for linguistic research into university interpreting in order to better inform interpreter educators. Utilizing this knowledge, interpreter education programs can better prepare graduating interpreting students for the linguistic and communicative challenges involved. Higher standards of preparation can then lead to improved practice in higher education and can also be applied to interpreting in other contexts. This chapter explores the linguistic features and strategies of interpreting (primarily in higher education), through the description of various research projects involving Australian Sign Language (Auslan)/English interpreters1 and their application to the education and practice of sign language interpreters. Although the research, education, and practice to be discussed are specific to the Australian context findings and suggestions are applicable to sign language interpreters working in higher education worldwide. The findings may also be applicable to sign language interpreting in other contexts, and to some extent spoken language interpreters working in a range of settings. (See Davis, this volume, for discussion of the implications of linguistic strategies used by educational interpreters working with deaf children.)

"Absolute pitch: Perception, coding, and controversies: Erratum.","Reports an error in the original article by Daniel J. Levitin and Susan E. Rogers (Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2005[Jan], Vol 9[1], 26-33.) Box 3 contains the statement: 'Other evidence is an ethnicity cluster for AP; that is, a higher rate of AP among Asians that is not attributable to sociocultural variables, because the elevated rate is also found in Americans of Asian descent. Speaking a tonal language cannot alone account for this finding, as not all Asian languages are tonal', (p. 29). The author wishes it to be known that it has been drawn to his attention that the Asian subjects in the study referred to here were largely students born in Asia and were attending school in the US, so English was not their primary language. Furthermore, many Asian languages (such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Thai) are tonal, and certain others, such as Japanese and some dialects of Korean, are 'pitch accent', in which the pitch structure of words can be used to signify different meanings. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record 2005-01034-007). Recent findings in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology are converging to shed light on the nature of processing, categorization and memory for pitch in humans and animals. Although most people are unable to name or place pitch values in consistent, well-defined categories, as they do for color, stable long-term memory for pitch has been shown in certain animal species, in infants, and in both adult musicians and nonmusicians. 'Absolute pitch', the rare ability to label pitches without external reference, appears to require acquisition early in life, and involves specialized brain mechanisms, now partially identified. Research on pitch coding strategies informs wider theories in cognitive science of semantic memory, and the nature of perceptual categories.

Robert Schumann (1810-1856)-Pathography.,"Robert Alexander Schumann, a German composer, pianist and conductor, was born in 1810 in Zwickau, Saxony. There were some psychiatric diseases in his family, like schizophrenia, and depression, which partly ended with hospitalization and suicide. Alcoholism and cerebrovascular insults were not rare either. It was a family of intellectuals and very sensible individuals. Already in his early childhood, he showed extraordinary skills in both music and journalism; and he remained active in both areas until his final illness. He was very sensitive and anxious child, sometimes depressive, and having sleeping disorder. At university, Robert often got involved with ""easy"" women, regularly under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol produced many harmful effects on his physical and mental health; he experienced great fears, developed a split personality, and had hallucinations. At the age of 23, he was under treatment for cold fever, which appeared as a consequence of his night-life in alcohol. Even though he drunk a lot in order to get over his neurosis and pseudo-neurasthenic disturbances more easily, he had hallucinations and ""light-seeing"" states and heard music inside his head. His mental, neurological and physical condition was destructed mostly in the last three years by syphilitic progressive paralysis - general paresis, which ended Schumann's life far too early, at the age of 46.

"Biopsychosocial influences on female accompanying expatriate spouses' psychological well-being in tokyo, japan.","A growing number of employees from multinational corporations and their spouses are being assigned to work overseas in Asian countries like Japan. A major reason for failed overseas assignments of American expatriate employees is their spouse's inability to adjust (Black, 1988). Indeed, accompanying expatriate spouses tend to experience more challenging transitions than do the transferred employees because they lack readily available support and structure in the host country (Briody & Chrisman, 1991). Nonetheless, very little research has studied accompanying expatriate spouses. The purpose of this study was to examine biopsychosocial factors that influence the psychological well-being, adjustment to Japan, and depression levels of Western, female accompanying expatriate spouses living in Japan due to their husbands' work there. Self-report questionnaires tapping demographic, biological and psychosocial factors, plus subjective well-being, adjustment to Japan, and depression, were completed by 184 Western, English-speaking, married women in Tokyo. Participants also answered three open-ended questions about their adjustment to Japan. Responses were analyzed by hierarchical multiple regressions, correlations, and discovery-oriented research. Results indicated that 50%, 28%, and 57% of the variance in subjective well-being, general adjustment to Japan, and depression, respectively, was accounted for by biological and psychosocial factors, with the psychosocial factors contributing beyond the biological variables. Individual, unique predictors were found; for example, hardiness, marital satisfaction, goal commitment, and amount of institutional support each had independently significant effects on subjective well-being. Additionally, cross-cultural self-efficacy singularly influenced adjustment to Japan, and many of the predictors made individually unique contributions to depressive symptoms. The findings further underscored that forming social connections, being involved in their children's schools, and partaking in clubs were the most helpful factors in the participants' adjustment, while the language barrier and lack of support from their husband's job site were the biggest impediments. The results highlight potential ways to help this population of women through education, advocacy, consultation, workshops, and therapy aimed at strengthening their marital satisfaction, commitment to goals, and support systems, among other things. This study adds to the subjective well-being literature by collectively investigating a group of factors conceptualized under the biopsychosocial framework with this understudied population.

Learning to play music in later adulthood: A personal perspective focusing on the piano.,"As compared to young children, older adults have knowledge of musical grammar and considerable lifelong exposure to specific music pieces. Hence, it is argued that techniques for teaching children to play the piano are not the most effective for adults. A method for teaching piano to adults is proposed that shares elements with second language acquisition. The argument is based on personal experience of the author who began studying piano at the age of 60 years and acquired proficiency to perform classical works of considerable difficulty in a relatively short time. The argument is also consistent with the psychological views of Kohler and Bartlett. References to particular examples of classical works of Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, and Chopin illustrate the perspective of acquiring musical skill in later life.

The development of a research design to assess the effects of individual music therapy with mentally ill children and adolescents.,"Developed a research design to measure the effects of individual music therapy on clinically relevant improvement in psychiatric symptoms, prosocial competencies and quality of life for children and adolescents with mental or behavioral disorders. Issues assessed in the pilot study where the adequacy of standard or other questionnaires, use of a parallel control group and the number of Ss necessary to achieve sufficient statistical power. Ss were 7 4-11 yr olds who received outpatient music therapy in various settings. Five children received music therapy, and 2 did not. Measures included the total problem and competence T-scores of the German Child Behaviour Checklist, the Munich questionnaire on health-related quality of life in children, therapist ratings on visual analogue scales and therapist retrospective assessments. Results show that at post-treatment, the children who received music therapy improved in all 3 outcome domains. The sensitivity and relevance of the instruments and the feasibility of a parallel no-treatment control group was confirmed and further details of the research design were clarified. The results are seen to support the continuation of this research with a larger sample. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Learning proper nouns and common nouns without clues from syntax.,"Syntax has been noted to play an important role in word learning in English; it distinguishes the fundamental conceptual difference between individuals (coded as proper nouns), nonindividuals (coded as mass nouns), and classes of individuals (coded as count nouns). The Japanese language does not have grammatical markers flagging the distinctions between count nouns and mass nouns, between proper nouns and common nouns, or between singulars and plurals. How Japanese 2- and 4-yr-olds assign meaning to novel nouns associated with familiar and unfamiliar animals and inanimate objects was studied in this paper. When a novel label was given to an unfamiliar object, children assumed it to be a name for a basic-level object category whether the referent was an animal or an inanimate object. If the named object already had an established name, and if the object was an inanimate object, the children mapped the noun to a subordinate category. When the named object was an animal, however, they tended to interpret the label as a proper name. These results demonstrate that in the absence of useful information from syntax, 2-yr-old Japanese children are able to fast map a noun to its meaning by coordinating word-learning biases and other available sources of information.

Irregular transcripts?,"One of the most famous phenomena in language acquisition is the over-regularization of the past tense of English. According to conventional wisdom, children's use of the English past tense through development follows a U-shaped curve: initially, children use all past forms correctly; then, correct performance dips as children apply the regular past ending ('-ed') to irregular stems, creating over-regularized forms such as 'goed' and 'singed'; finally, children recover from this error and produce all forms correctly. After a close examination of transcripts of children's speech, G. Marcus et al (1992) found that actual rates of over-regularization were very low (around 5%) and hardly worthy of special analysis at all. Marcus et al argued that these small error rates are simply the result of occasional memory retrieval difficulties with the irregular past forms, which normally serve to block the regular forms. In a recent paper, M. Maratsos (2000) returned to the data in an effort to reinstate the conventional wisdom that there is a real stage in development in which both the correct irregular forms and the over-regularized past forms are in competition in the child's grammar. Maratsos argues that the transcripts, which represent at best only a few hours of speech per child per week, cannot be used directly as a means to measure the time course of acquisition. According to Maratsos, the acquisition of memorized forms (such as irregular past forms) is most probably token-dependent, and the vast majority of the tokens of each verb type a child hears (and produces) will occur outside of the available transcripts. This paper goes a long way towards re-establishing the legitimacy of the past tense over-regularization phenomenon, but more than that, it raises important issues of how best to use the extensive transcripts of child speech now widely available.

On subtypes of developmental dyslexia: Evidence from processing time and accuracy scores.,"Determined the proportion of phonological dyslexics (Ph-DYS) and surface dyslexics (S-DYS) in a population of French dyslexics by applying A. Castles and M. Coltheart's (1993) regression method to 2 diagnostic measures: pseudo-word and irregular-word processing time. 31 dyslexics were matched to 19 average readers of the same age (aged 10 yrs, CA controls) and to 19 younger children of the same reading level (aged 8 yrs, RL controls). Compared to CA controls, there were more Ph-DYS than S-DYS. Compared to RL controls, there were still a high number of Ph-DYS. The reliability of these subtypes across different measures of phonological and orthographic skills was also examined. Compared to RL controls, both groups of dyslexics were found to be impaired only in phonological skills. The moment at which the 2 dissociated profiles emerged in the course of cognitive development was assessed by examining data that was collected when the children were 7 and 8 yrs old. The results show that only the S-DYS's orthographic deficit increased with development. The authors also looked at whether the Ph-DYS and S-DYS profiles were associated with other specific cognitive deficits. Specific deficits in phonemic awareness and in phonological short-term memory were found for both Ph-DYS and S-DYS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)     Abstract (French)     La dyslexie phonologique se caracterise par un deficit de la voie phonologique de lecture et la dyslexie de surface par un deficit de la voie orthographique. Le premier objectif de l'etude est d'evaluer la proportion de chacun de ces deux profils chez des enfants francophones. Trente et un dyslexiques de 10 ans ont ete apparies a deux groupes controle de 19 lecteurs moyens: un de meme age et un de meme niveau de lecture (8 ans). Les deux groupes de lecteurs moyens comportent les memes enfants, testes a 8 et 10 ans. Des dyslexiques emanent d'une cohorte de pratiquement 400 enfants qui ont ete suivis depuis l'age de 5 ans et les lecteurs moyens d'un sous-groupe de 43 enfants de cette cohorte. Au debut de l'etude, ces enfants ne presentaient aucun deficit dans les domaines classiquement repertories comme constituant des facteurs de risque pour les apprentissages academiques. Ils ont tous passe a 5, 6, 7 et 8 ans les memes epreuves. Toutefois, pour les passations faites a 7 et 8 ans, nous n'avons pu utiliser un ordinateur pour les epreuves de lecture qu'avec les 43 enfants du sous-groupe. A 10 ans, les dyslexiques et les lecteurs moyens ont passe les epreuves de lecture dans la version informatisee. Les profils de dyslexie ont ete etablis a l'aide de la methode des regressions mise au point par Castles et Coltheart (1993), en prenant comme indicateur des performances phonologiques et orthographiques les temps de reponse en lecture de pseudomots et de mots irreguliers. La comparaison avec les lecteurs moyens de meme age permet de faire ressortir 16 dyslexiques phonologiques (Ph- DYS) et 10 dyslexiques de surface ( S-DYS). Onze Ph- DYS, mais seulement 3 S-DYS, resistent a la comparaison avec les enfants de meme niveau de lecture. Le second objectif de l'etude est d'evaluer la fiabilite de cette classification. Dans ce but, on a examine les scores des differents groupes (les 16 Ph- DYS, les 10 S-DYS, et les deux groupes de lecteurs moyens), dans differentes mesures permettant d'evaluer leurs performances phonologiques et orthographiques: les mesures qui ont servi a typologiser les dyslexiques, plus la precision de la reponse en lecture et en ecriture de pseudomots et de mots irreguliers. Les competences orthographiques des dyslexiques, quel que soit leur type de dyslexie et quelle que soit la mesure utilisee, ne different pas de celles des enfants de meme niveau de lecture. Cette meme comparaison fait par contre ressortir un deficit phonologique dans les deux groupes de dyslexiques, soit pour la rapidite de la reponse chez les Ph- DYS, soit pour la precision de cette reponse, en lecture comme en ecriture, chez les S-DYS. Le troisieme objectif est d'evaluer a partir de quand emergent les profils dissocies. Les donnees longitudinales recueillies en ecriture de pseudomots et de mots irreguliers ont seulement permis de relever que le deficit orthographique des S-DYS est plus fortement marque lors de la derniere session. Enfin, on a examine la question de la specificite des deficits cognitifs des dyslexiques, en dehors de la lecture-ecriture. Chez les Ph- DYS, comme chez les S-DYS, des deficits en memoire a court-terme phonologique (mais pas en memoire visuelle non-verbale) et en analyse phonemique (mais pas en analyse musicale) ont ete releves. De plus, le deficit en analyse phonemique est observe dans les deux groupes de futurs dyslexiques a 5 ans, avant... (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Specific phonological and metaphonological deficit in developmental dyslexia.,"Conducted a longitudinal study to test the hypothesis that children with specific reading disabilities have mainly phonological and metaphonological difficulties. Human Ss: 15 male and female French school-age children (slight reading impairment) (4th graders) (experimental group). Eight male and female French school-age children (severe reading impairment with IQ deficit) (4th graders) (experimental group). 28 male and female French school-age children (dyslexia without IQ deficit) (4th graders) (experimental group). 21 normal male and female French school-age children (4th graders) (control group). Experimental Ss were selected from a group of 370 Ss who were followed from the beginning of the last year of kindergarten through the end of 4th grade. Phonological and musical awareness and verbal and nonverbal IQ were assessed from kindergarten through 2nd grade or 4th grade. Short-term visual and phonological memory, rapid naming, and rapid pseudoword repetition were assessed in 4th grade. (English abstract) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Analysis of praxis competence evolution among other cognitive abilities.,"Studied the association of practice, performance, and cognitive ability. Human Ss: 25 male and female normal Italian preschool and school-age children (aged 4 yrs 10 mo to 5 yrs 10 mo) (preschool students). Ss were evaluated for cognitive and performance competence during preschool and 1 yr later at entrance to elementary school. Ss were tested on the ability to imitate simple and complex gestures; memory of geometric figures, concrete objects, reproduction of rhythmic structures, word recall, and music melody recall; verbal expression and language competence; spatial-temporal ability; grammar comprehension; perception of graphic organization; and ability to learn a sequence of motor skills by practice.

The relationship between musical ability and literacy skills.,"Explored a possible link between musical ability and literacy skills in 78 children (aged 7.5-8.9 yrs). Ss were tested on picture vocabulary, aural awareness, reading, and spelling. Rhythm was significantly related to reading ability and, to a lesser degree, spelling ability. Pitch was significantly related to reading and spelling, except when vocabulary was partialled out. In a further pilot study of Ss aged 8.1 to 10.8 yrs, 6 Ss were assigned to a musical program intervention group, and 6 Ss were assigned to a control group. Both groups were matched for reading ability on an initial test and were administered the same test after the intervention. Reading scores for the intervention group increased from initial to final testing, but scores for the controls did not change. Results indicate that musical skills training is a valuable strategy for assisting children with reading difficulties.

Mutation and menarche in boys and girls, respectively, served as criteria for onset of puberty. Also, testosterone in saliva was determined. Maturation rate was a crucial variable only with respect to spatial ability, and this was influenced by sex and by the type of test used.

The influence of contextual factors on Afro-American and Euro-American children's performance: Effects of movement opportunity and music.,"40 Black and 32 White low-income children learned to pair pictures in an acquisition context that allowed them to coordinate movement with music (high movement expressive [HME]) and an acquisition context that allowed for little movement opportunity and no music (low movement expressive [LME]). Ss were subsequently tested for picture pair retention in a context where music was either present or absent. Black Ss' tested performance was superior in the HME acquisition context, while White Ss' performance was superior in the LME context. The presence of music at testing context independently enhanced the performance of Black Ss only. (French abstract) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0

Basic factors in the formation of speech behavior.,"Tested 13 3-6 yr old hard-of-hearing children to determine how preschoolers' speech develops. A popular Japanese nursery rhyme that usually takes about 13 sec to sing and uses 7 typical gestural patterns was used for observation and analyzed for formation of speech behavior. The nursery rhyme was presented to Ss by singing with gestural movements (on a TV screen) or without gestural movements (through a tape recorder). The song was presented at 2 different speeds (13 sec followed by 10 sec). Ss' gestures and/or singing responses were recorded with a camera. Observations were made once every 6 mo for about 3 yrs. Gestural skills were formulated from slow to quick movements, from hesitation to no hesitation, from the indistinct to the distinct, and from the indiscriminate to the discriminate. Ss responded 1st to 13 sec of singing and subsequently to 10 sec of singing, indicating progressive development of auditory discrimination functions. This effect is judged to be very significant for the study of speech development and for the observation and assessment of speech formation in children with delayed speech, including the hearing-impaired and mentally retarded.

Some thoughts about theory and practice of music therapy.,"Discusses the origins, principles, and application of music therapy (MT). Music, a tonal analog of emotional life, is considered a form of auditory thinking that can be emotionally ""truthful"" in a way that language cannot. Psychoanalytic theory of MT relates the healing power of music to the acoustic-emotional experiences of very early childhood and to the auditory thinking that is characteristic of this period. The healing power of MT is derived from nonverbal patient-therapist communication using musical material. A patient can break through problems and express inner thoughts and feelings with MT that could not be related or understood with language-based therapy (H. Kohut, 1971, 1977, 1984). Using musical material, the skilled therapist can understand or share in the ""existence"" of the patient's life, which usually is very important in the healing process. The individual's personal growth is considered the main objective of MT training. (English abstract) (22 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Cross-cultural applications of Yodai mnemonics in education.,"Discusses M. Nakane's Yodai mnemonics, a system consisting of verbal mediators (e.g., phrases, rhymes, songs) that have been used to teach mathematics, science, spelling, grammar, and English. Whereas most mnemonics aid in the memory of specific facts, Nakane's mnemonics aid in the memory of principles, rules, and procedures. Some Yodai mnemonics have been adapted for teaching mathematical operations with fractions in the US. The present author describes the mnemonics and reviews research on their effectiveness in instruction. Research questions on the nature of Yodai and on adapting Yodai in Western cultures are suggested. It is also suggested that Nakane's methods might be of theoretical value to educators interested in instructional techniques, psychologists interested in cognitive processes (particularly memory), and researchers interested in cross-cultural comparisons or in child development.

Relationship between reading proficiency and two types of classificatory ability.,"Two experiments assessed the validity of the emphasis placed by the substrata factor theory (J. A. Holmes, 1965; and H. Singer, 1976) on the importance of classification in the process of learning to read. From an initial pool of 59 boys of similar working-class background and a mean age of 15.69 yrs, attending secondary schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 2 groups of 12 were selected. One group was identified as a normal-reader group; the other as a poor-reader group (based on the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices and vocabulary and comprehension subtests of a standardized reading test). The classificatory ability of the 2 groups was assessed by 2 tasks: (1) a free-sort task, which tested the Ss' use of conceptual and idiosyncratic grouping strategies in their recall of pictorial stimuli and (2) the associative grouping task, which measured the Ss' use of superordination. Results show a positive correlation between reading proficiency and classificatory ability in support of the substrata factor theory. Findings support the view that reading disability is associated with a poorly integrated network of abilities. Differences in scores between good and poor readers on the free-sort task were not as marked as might be expected from earlier research, and explanations for this discrepancy are suggested.

On primary communication.,"Explores primary communication in the psychoanalytic context of transference and countertransference. Primary communication is defined as a regressive type of nonverbal communication made possible by projective identification. It coincides with the process of regression within the subject-object bond and is established in accordance with the container-content model and reverie function that characterize the mother-baby bond. Primary communication is considered within the framework of the theory of language development as metalanguage, deep language, deep grammar, or musical language, effectively preceding the development of symbolic-verbal and lexicographical language. Three case examples illustrate the processes that give rise to primary communication, including active psychotic areas of the personality, a tendency toward fusion with the object and idealization of it, and an overflooding of persecutory anxieties.

Auditory capability and school performance in spoken English: A study of the factorial structure of musical and linguistic tests.,"27 French schoolchildren (mean age 12.75 yrs) were given 3 auditory perception tests, 3 oral English-language tests, and 4 standard psychometric tests, the item scores of which were submitted to a principal-components (eigenvector) analysis. The 1st principal component reflected traditional school aptitude (high positive psychometric loadings), and the 2nd showed considerable positive loading on the English and music items, as well as small negative loadings on the psychometric items. The 2nd factor (""sensorial"") suggests that sensory and rhythmic school exercises might facilitate foreign-language acquisition in children.

Citizenship education in the People's Republic of China.,"Chinese children as young as 56 days old may enter a nursery that is attached to a factory where the mother is employed. By 2 yrs of age they are surrounded by political posters and are taught songs, dances, and plays celebrating workers, peasants, and productive labor. Kindergarten, for ages 3-6, focuses on early academic skills, but the content of the material is political. This indoctrination continues into primary school, which lasts from ages 7 to 12. Primary schools have a pupil-operated workshop, which may be run in cooperation with a local industry. Middle school typically offers politics, Chinese language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, English, history, geography, practical knowledge of agriculture and industry, and physical training. Specific examples of the 10-yr emphasis on politics are given. (7 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Musical illustration of stories in the music curriculum of a school for the mentally handicapped.,"The fairy tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is used to illustrate techniques for the musical interpretation of a story by mentally handicapped children with moderate language proficiency. Musical techniques such as a distinct musical theme and/or instrument associated with each major character, tempo and dynamic modifications, and motif variations are suggested for effecting a detailed musical transposition of the story. Recommendations are made for combining musical illustration with dramatic interpretation of stories. (French abstract) (16 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
Developmental influences on children's perception.,"Examined the role of developmental influences on children's perception. Children with apparently dominant modes of either auditory or visual perception, that is, who showed outstanding ability in music or graphic arts, were matched with control groups of normal children. In all, 72 8-11 yr olds from 12 schools in an industrial English city were studied. Memory and perception tests in music and art were specially designed and given to all Ss with measures of personality, intelligence, verbal ability, and interests (e.g., Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices, Children's Personality Questionnaire, and English Picture Vocabulary Test). Parents and teachers were interviewed, and homes and schools were visited and assessed. The experimental and control groups were compared for each variable by ANOVA, using orthogonal comparisons. Talented Ss were highly superior to their controls on specific ability tests but overlapped with each other on some of the tests of aesthetic ability. Parental attitudes and provision appeared to be of supreme importance in the development of aesthetic perception and practice. It is suggested that both the direction and growth of aesthetic abilities are allied to opportunities for perceptual learning at a fundamental level.

Psychic disturbances in a child displaying Silverman's syndrome.,"Reports the case of an 8-yr-old boy referred to the clinic by his school for problem behavior. Physical examination revealed that he was a battered child. Both parents were alcoholics and totally rejected him. The husband played a strong protector role to the wife. The patient nonetheless idealized his parents. He had had very poor physical health from birth, appeared ""over-mature"" verbally with adult vocabulary and sentence structure but with no relationship to reality, and sometimes lapsed into incoherence. In general, he appeared pathologically euphoric but had episodes of singing on themes of danger, accidents, and catastrophe.

Intelligence and aptitudes.,"One of the purposes of this book is to lead to a better understanding of ourselves and other people. The behavior of anyone bears some relationship to his intelligence. Therefore, if we are to understand his behavior, it becomes necessary to have some appreciation of the level at which he is functioning intellectually. In this chapter we shall try to explain what intelligence is and, to some extent, the part it plays in behavior. Intelligence is a way of behaving. A person may behave intelligently or stupidly. Two very important factors are instrumental in determining this behavior: (1) the kind of nervous system, particularly the brain, that he is born with; and (2) the extent to which the potential has grown or developed. In other words, intelligence consists of the knowledge and skills he has acquired and the use to which he puts them. There is no way of describing intelligence apart from the performance of a person. There is no instrument available that will enable us to measure intelligence directly. It is made up of a number of factors, not all of which are yet known. A number, known as primary mental abilities, have been factored out. Measures of such abilities as verbal meaning, number ability, word fluency, memory, reasoning, and spatial relations give results which are indicative of the level of intelligence. Since many of these factors or abilities enter into the total intelligence, two people may have the same total or general level and still vary widely in individual abilities. The first intelligence tests were developed in 1905 by the French psychologists Binet and Simon. Since that time these original scales have been revised many times and adapted to use with people, particularly children, in many other countries. An important limitation of individual tests, such as the Stanford-Binet and Wechsler scales, is that they are not suited to group administration. The Army Alpha and the Army General Classification tests, developed in World Wars I and II respectively, have been the most widely used tests of the group type. The Primary Mental Ability Tests yield an over-all intelligence score but in addition they give measures of several different mental abilities. Intelligence in the general population is spread over a wide range from the mentally defective to the genius. In a large unselected sample this distribution closely approximates the normal curve. One interesting observation about the behavior of people is that those low on the scale tend to remain low, the average tend to remain average, and the superior tend to remain superior. The low, average, and superior groups remain so but individuals within these groups are subject to greater variation. Aptitude is trainability, or potential for developing specific ability. Many tests have been designed to measure aptitudes. Widely used are the School and College Ability Tests for high school students and college freshmen. The Graduate Record Examination is used for selection of students for graduate study. These tests attempt to measure scholastic aptitude as a means of predicting success in school. In the vocational field, tests are used to measure the potential a person has for various jobs in such areas as mechanical, clerical, music, and art.

The wonderchild phenomenon in the development of the normal child.,"From his pediatric practice the author observes in young children the appearance of special talents which are largely due to imitation or particular gifts of protracted interest and concentration. These special capacities often disappear and seem to be only phases in the development of the ultimately average adult. The truly poetic talent is of another character than an early rhyming skill as is the truly musical gift to be distinguished from a precocious ability to imitate and remember tunes.

Correlates of intelligence in college students.,"Freshmen entering Barnard College from 1926 to 1931 and the present senior class constitute the subjects of the study. When these were grouped according to the occupation of their fathers, the rank order of the groups on the basis of the median score made on the Thorndike intelligence examination was: professional, skilled mechanics, business and technical, and unskilled. In the professional group the children of teachers, engineers, architects, and writers scored highest. Those majoring in English, natural sciences, social sciences, and foreign languages were about equal in number and their median intelligence test scores ranked in the order named, the differences being slight, however. Certain subjects such as physics, anthropology, mathematics, zoology, psychology, and English seemed to attract students of superior ability. Students majoring in the classics, art, and music, on the other hand, rated lowest. For the first two years after graduation, the correlation between earnings and intelligence test score was zero or less, but with the third year after graduation there began to be a slight positive correlation.

The psychology of the fine arts.,"A discussion of the fine arts may properly be introduced by referring to the section of the chapter on English which deals with the nature of emotions. The fine arts, like literature, influence human attitudes and find one of their chief values in the emotions which they arouse in human beings. An analysis of the fine arts which are included in the high-school curriculum must begin with a study of the relation of these arts to subjective reactions. This chapter examines these specific topics: Emotional appreciation and the fine arts; Training in technique of production; Relation between skill and appreciation; Absence of social compulsion for the study of the fine arts; The attitudes of other civilizations toward certain arts; American attitude toward art; Surplus energy and art; Art and social needs; Music the most common school art; Primitive music as a rhythmical succession of sounds; The drummer as the first specialist in music; Melody as a sequence of tones; Multiplication of pure tones; Instrumentation and the evolution of music; Evolution of harmony; The operation of the group mind; Individual acquisition of music; Tonal discrimination; Ability and training; Tonal production by the voice; The psychology of habit; Acquisition of skill in instrumental music; Recognition and appreciation of harmony; Production as a means of cultivating discrimination; Consequences of cultivated discrimination; Devices other than training in production; Formalism in art training; Training in appreciation as the goal of general education; Summary description of the practical situation; Emotional appreciation a matter of individual response rather than group response; Graphic art; The scrawl period of drawing; Schematic drawing as the second stage of graphic art; Arrested development at the schematic stage; Higher levels of art mastered by limited group; Differentiation of the graphic arts; The written alphabet derived from drawing; Writing as a social necessity; Design as a branch of graphic art; Psychology of aesthetics as psychology of sympathy; Mechanical drawing a phase of design; Representative art; Primitive painting symbolic in coloration; Defective perspective in early drawing; Method of instruction in representing perspective; Recognition simpler than reproduction; Technical art a product of analysis and example; Courses in appreciation of products of graphic art; and Comparative unsuccess of courses in art.

Heredity.,"Heredity is the term applied in biology to the production of like by like. The fact that the offspring of plants and animals always belong to the same species as their parents, is named if not explained by the word ""heredity."" When the term is used by stock-breeders and students of man, however, it has a more restricted meaning. It then refers not merely to the likeness in species, but to the less-marked characteristics that distinguish different breeds or families of the same species. A negro's child is not merely a human being, but he is a human being of the black type. A Bach is, as a rule, not merely a human being, a Caucasian and a German, but also a Bach in the sense of being a musical genius. The context will usually show whether the term is used in the narrower or the broader sense. In both senses, the laws and the fundamental phenomena are the same. A minute cell formed by the union of a cell from a male with the cell of a female of the same species develops into a being similar to its ancestors, both near and remote, and yet not exactly like any one of them. The characteristics of every animal and person are determined not only by the union of cells from two lines of ancestry, but also by the environment which begins to act as soon as the embryo is formed, and continues to mould the developing organism till birth, then in a still greater variety of ways until maturity. The changes produced before birth are often very marked, since a nervous shock to a mother four or five months before the birth of a child often results in some deformity in the child. It is claimed but not admitted by physicians that the physical and mental condition of the mother during the entire time the child is carried, affects its development in a marked degree. The special characteristics this gives a child are congenital, but not, properly speaking, hereditary. In common language they are often spoken of as hereditary, but in the scientific sense only those characteristics that result from the union of two germ cells are hereditary.

"Contrasting lexical biases in bilingual English-Mandarin speech: Verb-biased mothers, but noun-biased toddlers","Is noun dominance in early lexical acquisition a widespread or a language-specific phenomenon? Thirty Singaporean bilingual English-Mandarin learning toddlers and their mothers were observed in a mother-child play interaction. For both English and Mandarin, toddlers' speech and reported vocabulary contained more nouns than verbs across book reading and toy playing. In contrast, their mothers' speech contained more verbs than nouns in both English and Mandarin but differed depending on the context of the interaction. Although toddlers demonstrated a noun bias for both languages, the noun bias was more pronounced in English than in Mandarin. Together, these findings support early noun dominance as a widespread phenomenon in the lexical acquisition debate but also provide evidence that language specificity also plays a minor role in children's early lexical development. © The Author(s), 2021.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder are impaired in absolute but not relative pitch and duration matching in speech and song imitation,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit atypical imitation. However, few studies have identified clear quantitative characteristics of vocal imitation in ASD. This study investigated imitation of speech and song in English-speaking individuals with and without ASD and its modulation by age. Participants consisted of 25 autistic children and 19 autistic adults, who were compared to 25 children and 19 adults with typical development matched on age, gender, musical training, and cognitive abilities. The task required participants to imitate speech and song stimuli with varying pitch and duration patterns. Acoustic analyses of the imitation performance suggested that individuals with ASD were worse than controls on absolute pitch and duration matching for both speech and song imitation, although they performed as well as controls on relative pitch and duration matching. Furthermore, the two groups produced similar numbers of pitch contour, pitch interval-, and time errors. Across both groups, sung pitch was imitated more accurately than spoken pitch, whereas spoken duration was imitated more accurately than sung duration. Children imitated spoken pitch more accurately than adults when it came to speech stimuli, whereas age showed no significant relationship to song imitation. These results reveal a vocal imitation deficit across speech and music domains in ASD that is specific to absolute pitch and duration matching. This finding provides evidence for shared mechanisms between speech and song imitation, which involves independent implementation of relative versus absolute features. Lay Summary: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit atypical imitation of actions and gestures. Characteristics of vocal imitation in ASD remain unclear. By comparing speech and song imitation, this study shows that individuals with ASD have a vocal imitative deficit that is specific to absolute pitch and duration matching, while performing as well as controls on relative pitch and duration matching, across speech and music domains. © 2021 The Authors.

Associations of language-based bedtime routines with early cognitive skills and academic achievement: A follow-up from kindergarten to middle school,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the extent to which language-based bedtime routines (LBR) reported by parents before kindergarten were associated with early cognitive skills at kindergarten and subsequent academic achievement in typically developing children. Method: We followed a community-based sample of 664 French-speaking adolescents from kindergarten (5–6 years) to the end of middle school (15 years). Kindergarten measures included a parental questionnaire aimed at assessing the presence or absence of any kind of LBR, such as storytelling, looking at children’s books, reading a story, listening to songs, or singing nursery rhymes, as well as family contextual characteristics. Children also performed standardized assessments of oral language, pre-reading skills, and non-verbal reasoning. In middle school, children sat a national diploma typically used as an indicator of general academic achievement in Grade 9. Results: After adjusting for family characteristics, the presence of language-based bedtime routines (57%) predicted cognitive–academic skills in kindergarten, and was positively associated with academic achievement at Grade 9, related to the beneficial effect on children’s vocabulary in kindergarten. Conclusion: The presence of language-based bedtime routines may provide an indicator of positive parental behaviour including exposure to literacy activities, contributing to children’s early cognitive development and subsequent academic achievement. © 2021 The British Psychological Society",0
The Specificity Principle in Young Dual Language Learners’ English Development,"This study employs the Specificity Principle to examine the relative impacts of external (input quantity at home and at school, number of books and reading frequency at home, teachers’ degree and experience, language usage, socioeconomic status) and internal factors (children’s working memory, nonverbal intelligence, learning-related social-skills, chronological age, gender) on children’s English-language development in phonological awareness (PA), receptive vocabulary (RV), and word reading (WR). Altogether, 736 four- to five-year-old Singaporean Mandarin-English speaking kindergarteners were assessed twice longitudinally. Their English-language PA, RV, and WR development was predicted using the eight external factors and five internal factors with Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operators. Internal factors explained more variance than external factors in all three language domains. External factors had their largest impact on RV. © 2021 The Authors.

"Music, body movement, and dance intervention program for children with developmental coordination disorder","The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program, based on music, movement, and dance, aimed at improving motor skills in children at risk of developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Participants comprised 70 primary school children (47 boys/23 girls) aged between 6 and 8 years. Participants were given the Spanish adaptation of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children–Second Edition (MABC-2) to identify difficulties and initially classify into three groups: a group of 17 at risk of DCD who participated in the intervention program (Experimental Group), a group of 18 at risk of DCD who did not participate (Control Group with Risk) and a group of 35 children, with scores higher than the cutoff point (Control Group without Risk). The results show a significant improvement in the motor skills of children who participated in the intervention program, while those in the Control Group showed no significant changes in the second evaluation compared with the first. Likewise, it could be affirmed that this intervention based on group activities involving music, movement, and dance is a very successful blend for motor improvement in children with coordination problems, due to the combination of cognitive stimulation areas and techniques. © The Author(s) 2020.",0
Early childhood development and parental training interventions in rural China: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction Inadequate care during early childhood can lead to long-term deficits in skills. Parenting programmes that encourage investment in young children are a promising tool for improving early development outcomes and long-term opportunities in low-income and middle-income regions, such as rural China. Methods We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of early developmental delays and stimulating parenting practices as well as the effect of parental training programmes on child development outcomes in rural China. We obtained data in English from EconPapers, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus (Elsevier) and in Chinese from China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and VIP Information. We conducted frequentist meta-analyses of aggregate data and estimated random-effects meta-regressions. Certainty of evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results We identified 19 observational studies on the prevalence of developmental delays and stimulating parenting practices for children under 5 years of age (n=19 762) and ten studies on the impact of parental training programmes on early child development (n=13 766). Children's risk of cognitive, language and social-emotional delays in the rural study sites (covering 14 provinces mostly in Central and Western China) was 45%, 46%, and 36%, respectively. Parental training programmes had a positive impact on child cognition, language and social-emotional development. Conclusion There is evidence to suggest that early developmental delay and the absence of stimulating parenting practices (ie, reading, storytelling and singing with children) may be prevalent across rural, low-income and middle-income regions in Central and Western China. Results support the effectiveness of parental training programmes to improve early development by encouraging parental engagement.

"Disproportionate Representation of Children of Color and Parents with Disabilities in the Child Welfare System: The Intersection of Race/Ethnicity, Immigration Status, and Disability","CASE: An almost 5-year-old girl is referred to a developmental-behavioral clinician for developmental evaluation because of language and learning concerns. Her developmental screening in the primary pediatrics office showed scores concerning for delays in communication, social-emotional, gross, and fine motor domains. Her mother has concerns about her language. Her mother's primary language is Spanish, but the patient and her siblings speak primarily English. She speaks in short phrases and sentences with grammatical errors. Her mother understands approximately 75% of what she says, and strangers understand approximately 50%. She uses gestures and facial expression, is social and friendly, demonstrates pretend play, and plays well with her siblings and other children her age. She has occasional meltdowns, but there are no other major behavioral concerns. She feeds herself with utensils and is able to dress herself. She toilet trained recently, at about age 4.5 years.She did not receive early intervention before age 3 years and had no previous evaluations. She did not attend preschool or child care. Her mother reported that they were referred to the school district twice, but she had trouble requesting the evaluation.She lives with her parents and 2 brothers. The patient's parents immigrated to the United States from Mexico 7 years ago. They are both farm workers, and extended family members are in Mexico. On reviewing family history, the clinician learns that the patient's mother had trouble learning and attended school until she was 12 years old. She did not receive extra help at school. The child's mother said that she forgets things and ""has trouble with reading and writing fast."" The patient's 10-year-old brother has an individualized education plan and is in a substantially separate classroom. He has inclusion activities of recess, art, and music. He receives speech-language therapy and academic support for reading and writing. The patient's mother becomes tearful and shares that Child Protective Services was notified because of her inability to request the school evaluation, but a case was not opened.Developmental evaluation reveals expressive language at a 33-month-old level and receptive language at a 39-month-old level. Cognitive testing shows extremely low verbal comprehension, borderline visual spatial skills, and fluid reasoning in the low average range. Working memory and processing speed fall in the borderline range. The clinician learns at a follow-up visit that the patient's mother was evaluated by state disability services and has mild intellectual disability.What is your next step in management? What feedback or resources would you provide to the pediatric clinician and family? Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",0
And the Beat Goes On: Heartbeat Recordings through Music Therapy for Parents of Children with Progressive Neurodegenerative Illnesses,"Background: Music is a powerful therapeutic intervention to promote physical and psychological health, healing, and well-being. In pediatric palliative care, music therapists are often involved in preloss care. Heartbeat recordings (HBRs) synchronize the rhythm of the heartbeat into a favorite song. In preloss care, HBRs show promise in helping parents of children with progressive neurodegenerative illnesses (PNDI) cope with their chronic sorrow and the loss of their child. Objective: To explore the lived experience of HBRs for bereavement in the lives of parents of children with PNDI. Design: Phenomenological study. Setting/Subjects: Purposeful sample of 11 English-speaking parents of children with PNDI receiving palliative care services in an academic pediatric hospital were interviewed three months after receiving their child's HBR. Measurements: A semistructured interview guide was used to collect data concurrently with the mind mapping process. Results: Data from interviews revealed 4 major themes and 10 subthemes: (1) Bifocal View (parental lens vs. medical lens); (2) Navigating Life and Relationships (caregiver fatigue, grief and loss, marriage, job, brought us together, paying it forward); (3) Coping through Spirituality; and, (4) Legacy Creation (HBR as a connection, song selection). Conclusions: Parents of children with PNDI experience chronic sorrow. The HBR assisted in meaning-making that validated the child's life and supported the parents' expression of grief and their ability to cope. Further research is needed to validate the impact of HBRs in diverse populations. © 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",0

The presence of the ICT in the subjects of music of the Teacher's Degrees: An analysis of the educational plans,"The educational university plans represent a commitment between the institution and the students, by means of which what, when, how, why and for what the different contents of a subject will be developed. This study analyzes the presence of ICT in all educational plans of the subjects referred to the Music Education of the Degrees of Teacher of Childhood Education, Teacher of Primary Education and Double Degree (in its different modalities) of all Spanish universities (N = 892) and the differences are looked for according to the grades, the pertinence to the mention of music and the modality of delivery of each subject. The analysis of their competences, content blocks, activities, evaluation and documentary sources allows to affirm that ICTs are not present in these plans, so the training of future teachers in the current context should be reinforced in this sense. © 2021 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Children's opera as a means of learning and unity in times of Covid-19: An interdisciplinary proposal for distance education,"Music education emerges as a teaching-learning process which contributes to students comprehensive development. The main objective of this work was to analyze the adaptation of the distance educational process in Musical Education, Spanish Language and Literature, Physical Education and Art Education areas in sixth grade of Primary Education, through an interdisciplinary proposal based on the The magic flute opera by WA Mozart. It is based on a mixed approach in which the results obtained through a case study are complemented with descriptive procedures of a quantitative cut. The data analysis showed positive results regarding the participation and satisfaction of the families, students and teachers. Similarly, students obtained optimal levels of content acquisition and key competences. The results of this work corroborate the importance of proposing interdisciplinary projects, as well as the possibilities provided by online teaching in Primary Education in isolation situations, such as those caused by Covid-19. © 2021 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Children's interpretation of ambiguous pronouns based on prior discourse,"In conversation, individual utterances are almost always ambiguous, with this ambiguity resolved by context and discourse history (common ground). One important cue for disambiguation is the topic under discussion with a particular partner (e.g., “want to pick?” means something different in a conversation with a bluegrass musician vs. with a book club partner). Here, we investigated 2- to 5-year-old American English-speaking children's (N = 131) reliance on conversational topics with specific partners to interpret ambiguous or novel words. In a tablet-based game, children heard a speaker consistently refer to objects from a category without mentioning the category itself. In Study 1, 3- and 4-year-olds interpreted the ambiguous pronoun “it” as referring to another member of the same category. In Study 2, only 4-year-olds interpreted the pronoun as referring to the implied category when talking to the same speaker but not when talking to a new speaker. Thus, children's conception of what constitutes common ground in discourse develops substantially between ages 2 and 5. © 2020 The Authors. Developmental Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0
Concerted cultivation in early childhood and social inequalities in cognitive skills: Evidence from a German panel study,"According to Lareau's (2003) concept of concerted cultivation, upper and middle-class parents aim more systematically to promote their children's skills in various ways in comparison with lower class parents. These differences in parenting are assumed to affect children's skill development. Whereas Lareau developed her concept for families with elementary school children, and much of the subsequent literature has focused on this age group or older, we argue that concerted cultivation is likely to be visible already during early childhood. Therefore, we investigated if participation in organized leisure activities and parents’ promotion of cognitive stimulation during early childhood—as two indicators of concerted cultivation—explain later differences in cognitive skills. We furthermore examined if concerted cultivation mediates the association between social background and cognitive skills of children. We drew on longitudinal data from 1,632 children in the Starting Cohort 2 of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). We show that parents with high socio-economic status are more likely to enroll their 5-year-old children in organized leisure activities and to read to them daily. Results from lagged dependent variable regressions indicate that only enrollment in music mediates the relationship between parental socio-economic status and children's skill development in math and reasoning. Our study highlights the prevalence of concerted cultivation as a parenting style of the German middle-class already during early childhood. Nevertheless, it only moderately contributes to children's cognitive skill development. Our mediation analysis showed that only music participation explained a modest portion of the background-specific differences in math and reasoning skills. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
The novel of neronian rome and its multimedial transformations: Sienkiewicz’s quo vadis,"When in 1905 the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature ‘for outstanding services as an epic writer’, it was his novel Quo vadis. A Narrative of the Time of Nero that motivated the committee to bestow this notable honour. The extraordinary international success of Quo vadis catapulted the author into literary stardom, placing him at the top of international league tables for the sheer quantity of his readers. But, before long, the historical novel began to detach itself from the person of its author and to become a multimedial, mass-culture phenomenon. In the West and East, Quo vadis was adapted for the stage and screen, provided the inspiration for works of music and other genres of literature, was transformed into comic strips and illustrated children’s books, and was cited in advertising and referenced in everyday objects of material culture. No work in English to date has explored in depth the mechanisms that released Quo vadis into mass circulation and the influence that its diverse spin-off forms exercised on other areas of culture-even on the reception and interpretation of the literary text itself. In the context of a robust scholarly interest in the processes of literary adaptation and classical reception, and set alongside the recent emergence of interest in the ‘Ben-Hur tradition’, this volume provides a coherent forum for a much-needed exploration, from various disciplinary and national perspectives, of the multimedial transformations of Quo vadis. Uniquely, also, for its English-speaking readers this collection of essays renders more visible the cultural conquests achieved by Poland on the world map of classical reception. © Oxford University Press 2020.",0
Divergent Patterns of Variant Tag Questions in Pakistani English: A Corpus-based Comparative Study,"The research explores forms and function of variant tag questions (VTQs) in the native and non-native Englishes. For the said purpose, patterns of VTQs in Pakistani English are compared with two native (British and New Zealand) and two non-native (Indian and Singaporean) varieties. The components of the International Corpus of English, henceforth ICE (Greenbaum & Nelson, 1996) of the said varieties, have been used. Each ICE component consists of one-million-word corpus of the regional variety, with a common design, in order to ensure maximum comparability between the components (Nelson 1996). The ICE samples the English of adults (age 18 or over) who have been educated through medium of English to at least the end of secondary schooling. Convenient sampling technique is used to collect data. All the possible tags were extracted using AntConc 3.5.9 and the collocation were then studied. The results revealed that VTQs are under-used in non-native Englishes while least used in Pakistani English. As for the forms of VTQs, Pakistani speakers follow the native speakers and observe the grammatical rules. The functions of VTQs are analysed in Pakistani English, following Axelsson’s (2011) model, and compared with that of Indian English as both varieties share almost similar linguistic and sociocultural backgrounds. The results show that declarative VTQs are preferred to seek and exchange information in both the varieties. The research suggests that further linguistic entities may be explored to observe the similarities/differences in native and non-native varieties, including Indian and Pakistani Englishes, to establish their identities. © 2021.

Romanian civil engineer Anghel Saligny - An example for all civil engineers everywhere,"Engineer Anghel Saligny can be considered a promoter of civil engineering in Romania and beyond. He lived and activated in the second half of the nineteenth century and in the first quarter of the 20th century. Endowed with sparkling intelligence and exceptional creative skills, A. Saligny engineer has left the Romanian nation a lot of valuable constructions, unanimously both appreciated nationally and internationally, many of which are in operation today. Anghel Saligny was born on 25 April (2 May old style) in Şerbăneşti, Tulcea County (today Galaţi County). His father Alfred Saligny of French origin, after living for a while in Prussia, came to Moldova in the mid-eighteenth century and settled in Focşani. Here he married with a young lady of Polish origin named Ezarschi, making together three children: Alfonso, Anghel and Sofia. Both Alfred and his wife were educated, spicking well the German and French languages. They also knew the art of piano singing, so they dealt with the education of the children of the boyars (landowners) Ghica and Şuţu, on whose estates they lived. With the help of the boyar Şuţu, of the Moldovian schools, the family of Alfred Saligny opened a pension in Focşani, where their children were trained in the first four primary classes. Anghel and his older brother Alfonso continued the following four classes of gymnasium at the high school that had just begun in this town. The last high school classes continued with his brother Alfonso in Potsdam. Anghel, who was a very good mathematician, decided to pursue Astronomy with renowned professor Karl Theodor Weierstrass, but he soon realized that a technical profession was best suited to him, allowing him to free his creative imagination with which he was endowed. He gave up Astronomy and enrolled as a student at the Upper Technical School in Charlottenburg near Berlin. The new trainee engineer of 20 years age begun his professional activity at the works of the Cottbus-Frankfurt railway line with a great technician - Professor Mehrtens at the Polytechnic School in Dresden. In Cottbus he met Miss Thereza Köhna Kona of 15 years age, with whom he would marry and have two children unfortunately left out of life. Returning to the country at the end of 1875, he is immediately employed as a third-grade ordinary engineer at the Bridges and Roads Service. He runs quickly all the hierarchical steps, including general inspector, general manager and Minister of Public Works. He is received at the Romanian Academy, being elected president of the Academy. Anghel Saligny has created over the past five decades many original construction works of almost all kinds: roads and road bridges, railways and railway bridges, combined rail and road bridges, hydrotechnical works and land improvements, landscaping rivers and shorelines protection, ports and mooring berths, rope ways, metal and reinforced concrete silos, cultural and social buildings. However, the work that consecrated him remains “THE CAROL I” bridge, which consists of three main parts: the Bridge over the Borcea Arm in Feteşti, the Viaduct across the Iezer Valley and the Danube Bridge at Cernavodă, all having a total length of 4088 m, the longest bridge in Europe at that time. Numerous original solutions have been applied to these works, recalling the most important of them: the use of the world premiere of soft steel instead of puddle iron, which subsequently replaced the old material. More details about the conception, structures and construction of these interesting works will be presented in the full paper. Also, there will be presented many interesting insights about the life and rich activity of this pioneer of special constructions in Romania. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, London",0
Strengthening teaching competencies in early childhood education: A look at classroom activities,"Introduction: the increase in the offer of places in Early Childhood Education (ECE) after the adoption of the new Education Law (LOMLOE, 2020) must entail a commitment to improve quality, and one of the pillars on which it is based is the teaching competence of its teachers. The study analyzes teaching performance in the development of learning activities in the first cycle of ECE, based on the type of most frequent activities observed in classrooms from 0 to 3 years. The results of the study do not make inferences about initial training received by the teachers who have participated, but without raising questions that contribute to the review and improvement of the training, especially in its practical aspect. Methodology: a systematic observation is carried out using the ITERS-3 (Infant/ Toddler Environment Rating Scale, third edition) in an incidental sample of 31 classrooms from 21 ECE centres (0-3 years) in 4 Spanish Autonomous Communities, with a total of 340 students and 58 teachers. Results: The data show that the subscale “Activities” is the one that has received the lowest score, showing statistically significant differences from the other subscales (Space and Furnishings, Personal Care Routines, Language and Books, Interaction and Program Structure). Within this subscale, the minimum level of quality is not reached in 8 of the 10 items proposed by the scale: fine motor, art, music and movement, blocks, dramatic play, nature/science, math/number and promoting acceptance of diversity. In the items “Appropriate use of technology” and “Gross Motor” a minimum and good score is achieved respectively. Discussion: these results invite rethink the training of children’s education teachers in Spain. © 2021, Ministry Education and Science. All rights reserved.",0
Neural Plasticity in a French Horn Player with Bilateral Amelia,"Precise control of movement and timing play a key role in musical performance. This motor skill requires coordination across multiple joints, muscles, and limbs, which is acquired through extensive musical training from childhood on. Thus, making music can be a strong driver for neuroplasticity. We here present the rare case of a professional french horn player with a congenital bilateral amelia of the upper limbs. We were able to show a unique cerebral and cerebellar somatotopic representation of his toe and feet, that do not follow the characteristic patterns of contralateral cortical and ipsilateral cerebellar layout. Although being a professional horn player who trained his embouchure muscles, including tongue, pharyngeal, and facial muscle usage excessively, there were no obvious signs for an expanded somatosensory representation in this part of the classic homunculus. Compared to the literature and in contrast to control subjects, the musicians' foot movement-related activations occurred in cerebellar areas that are typically more related to hand than to foot activation. © 2021 Daniel S.

ICT and gamification experiences with CLIL methodology as innovative resources for the development of competencies in compulsory secondary education,"Due to the lack of research in the field of music through CLIL and ICT in Secondary Education in Spain, we propose to merge this subject with an innovative methodology. The general objective is to present a different approach to students in order to increase their motivation for the subject. The specific objectives are to teach music in English by integrating content, cognition and vocabulary through communication and the use of new technologies. This approach makes the design and implementation didactic, audiovisual and multimedia. Cuadernia: digital notebook composed of flash files, videos and audios, and gamification strategies. Quizziz: multiplayer questionnaire of class contents, based on teaching music through a cooperative methodology and gamification, are applied as options with a great educational projection, with information and innovative pedagogical experiences and potential to work together in the classroom with different levels of the subject. The results that follow the Likert scale reflect high student satisfaction with regard to teaching methodology, content acquisition, teacher training, ICT and resources. As a conclusion, of the coincident results between the professor and the students, we would like to implement it in the coming years. © 2021 Research Group Education and Virtual Learning (GREAV).

"Voice-Related Problems, Vocal and Non-Vocal Habits in Naradiya Kirtankars: A Preliminary Study","Objective: Naradiya kirtan is a part of India's rich folk heritage. Voice demands of the kirtankar (kirtan performer) include a combination of recitation, narration, and singing. Slight to moderate deviations in their voice could hamper their public image as well as endanger their career. A preliminary study was undertaken to explore the voice problems, vocal and non-vocal habits of Naradiya kirtankars. Study design: Cross-sectional study design. Method: A 22-item questionnaire was developed in English language and translated to Marathi language. This questionnaire was administered on 40 Naradiya kirtankars through purposive sampling. Participants included Naradiya kirtankars located in Mumbai and Pune cities with minimum of one-year training in the field and proficiency in Marathi language. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that kirtankars might be at a risk of developing voice problems. Among the kirtankars with voice problems, frequently pursued primary occupations involving extensive voice use, performed in a noisy environment, indulged in excessive talking, strained the neck muscles while voicing, impersonated voice, had reduced duration of sleep, and hearing difficulty as compared to kirtankars without voice problems. Conclusion: Study findings highlight the need for dedicated efforts towards increasing the awareness among the kirtankars’ about the vocal, non-vocal factors associated with voice problems and the role of voice health-care professionals in voice care. © 2021 The Voice Foundation",0
Home and school factors in early English language development,"The current study explored the home and school factors that are important for Singaporean pre-schoolers’ (N = 1440) early English development from K1 to P1. Language input quantity and quality factors at home (e.g., number of English books,) and at school (e.g., instructional support in class) were used to predict children’s English vocabulary and word reading development using linear mixed-effects models. Children’s internal factors (e.g., non-verbal reasoning) were controlled. The results revealed that children who had more English input and higher input quality at home demonstrated faster receptive vocabulary growth. Children’s word reading skill was more influenced by the English input quality at home. Children who were frequently read to in English demonstrated faster development in word reading competence. Mother’s educational level also mattered: higher maternal education was associated with faster growth in reading skill. The length of time children stayed at school and teachers’ qualification also significantly and positively associated with children’s English learning. These findings indicate the substantial contribution of the home literacy environment to Singaporean children’s early English language development, compared to the quality of teacher-child interactions in preschool. The necessity of more parental involvement in early English language learning at home is discussed under the realm of usage-based theory. © 2021 National Institute of Education, Singapore.",0
Competency profile on the use of ICT resources by Spanish music teachers: descriptive and inferential analyses with logistic regression to detect significant predictors,"The purposes of this study were twofold: (1) determine the level of digital competence that Spanish teachers have in the use of technological devices, Web 2.0 general tools and Web 2.0 music tools, according to the proficiency profiles established by the European Framework DigCompEdu; and (2) identify the significant predictors which affect Spanish teachers who have a high level of competence. The study uses an ex-post facto design with 115 Spanish secondary school music teachers. The results showed that teachers had a profile between Novice and Expert regarding the use of educational technology. In addition, age, attitude towards ICT and motivation in teaching practice are predictive variables that help predict high competence in the use of Web 2.0 general resources and technological devices in the classroom, while having studied at a conservatory and working as a teacher in a conservatory significantly influence the use of Web 2.0 music tools. © 2021 Technology, Pedagogy and Education Association.",0
Psychometric properties of the Brunel Mood Scale among athletes and non-athletes in Singapore,"Researchers in sport and exercise psychology have shown an enduring interest in mood responses, the study of which relies on well-validated and culturally relevant measures. The current study was a cross-cultural validation of the 24-item Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS: Terry et al., [1999]. Development and validation of a mood measure for adolescents. Journal of Sports Sciences, 17, 861–872. doi:10.1080/026404199365425) in a Singaporean context. The six-factor measurement model was tested among a sample of 1,444 English-speaking Singaporean participants (440 females) aged from 18–65 years, including 954 who were involved in sport. Structural equation modelling showed a good fit of the measurement model to the data (CFI =.956, TLI =.950, RMSEA =.052). Multisample analyses supported the invariance of the measurement model in different subsamples based on gender, age group, and sport participation. Concurrent measures correlated with subscale scores in line with theoretical predictions. Internal consistency and test–retest reliability were acceptable. Mood responses varied predictably by gender, age group, and sport participation. Findings supported the psychometric integrity of the BRUMS, providing opportunities to examine the antecedents, correlates, and behavioural consequences of mood responses among Singaporeans. © 2021 International Society of Sport Psychology.",0
What makes a child musical? conceptions of musical ability in childhood,"Tests of musical ability in children have relied on diverse conceptions of what musical abilities are. Recent investigations suggest that such conceptions can be seen as socially constructed and differ between cultures, sub-groups, and individuals. Based on a previous study on conceptions of adult musical ability, we designed a questionnaire targeting musical behaviours of 3–6-year-old children. 922 German adults who regularly spend time with children assessed how often a musical child would show these behaviours. Principal component analysis revealed four components of childhood musical ability: musical communication, enthusiasm and motivation, analytical understanding of music, and musical abilities in a narrow sense. The importance assigned to the components differed depending on musical expertise: Participants with higher expertise rated analytical music skills as significantly less important. Results suggest that ecologically valid tests of musical ability in childhood should cover a wide range of skills and observable behaviours. © 2021 The Author(s).

The Music in Early Childhood Education: Comparative review of curricula Spanish autonomous communities,"The transfer of the Spanish State to the Autonomous Communities with full competences in education during the last two decades of the 20th century currently allows two different levels to be found where official curricula are developed: the national and the autonomous ones. This double conception is the starting point of this study where it is intended to delve into the differences and similarities of a specific curricular element, the contents. The purpose of this study is to establish the differences and similarities between the music content present in the curricula of the different Spanish autonomous communities and the Royal Decrees published that contain the minimum teachings for the second cycle of Early Childhood Education for the Spanish national framework in two different legislative context: LOGSE and LOE. With its own methodological design within the field of Comparative Education and using the CARMEN questionnaire based on the comparative analysis of curricular elements as the main research instrument. The results reveal that the presence of the musical contents in the different blocks there are starting differences regarding the national documents taken as a reference. Changes in the contents of the regional documents with respect to their national documents were more frequent for the LOGSE period. It has been verified that there is no influence of the political party present in order to establish a greater or lesser degree of similarity in the minimum teachings. Educational curricula are not used in Spain as an ideological tool at the service of the ideals of one political party or another as regards Music Education in the Early Childhood Education. © 2021 Univ Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED).

Wojciech Kętrzyński’s return to his Polish roots,"Wojciech Kętrzyński’s father (1838-1918), a Pole of Kashubian origin who served as a gendarme in Lec (Giżycko), never disavowed his Polish roots. However, Wojciech’s mother, a native German, naturally exerted a greater influence on her child through parenting. Wojciech grew up bilingual, speaking both German and the Masurian dialect. For decades, scientific literature repeatedly claimed that Kętrzyński had been Germanized under the influence of his family home, during his school years in Lec, and later in Potsdam and Rastembork (Kętrzyn). Having found out from his sister’s letter that their father had been born a Pole, Kętrzyński decided to adopt Polish nationality (Entschluss) only at the age of 18 (1856). However, the author’s studies revealed that the evolution of Kętrzyński’s national awareness was a much longer process. First of all, he never forgot about his father’s Polish ancestry, even in Potsdam. In Rastembork, Kętrzyński became a keen reader of Polish historical literature, and this influence was primarily responsible for his decision to acknowledge his Polish roots in 1856. In fact, a volume of poetry penned by Kętrzyński in his youth, entitled Aus dem Liederbuch eines Germanisierten (“From the Songbook of Someone Germanized”), clearly indicates that Kętrzyński had been indeed Germanized. The fact that the evolution of Kętrzyński’s Polish identity had been a slow process was confirmed by his close friends, including Lviv historian Władysław Semkowicz. © 2020 University of Warmia and Mazury.

The effectiveness of audio media for English learning based on scripted song at the fifth grade of elementary school,"This study aims at determining the effectiveness of audio media based on scripted song that was developed based on themes for the fifth-grade elementary school students. After validation by two experts on content and quality, the developed media was implemented in Public Elementary School 205/IV Jambi, which involved 25 students. The study design used a pre-post treatment design. The results of the study proved that the audio media is effective in increasing the fifth grade students’ English competence especially in listening and speaking It is shown by the average learning achievements of 6.69 that are categorized fair before the action to 8.32, which are categorized good after the action. Besides, the results of the questionnaire proved that all students (100%) showed a positive perception of the use of audio media based on scripted song They became more motivated to learn because through song, the learning became fun, interesting, and the learning material became more easily understood. © 2021, Ankara University.

"“They made neither a profession nor a commodity out of them”: printing, schoolbook trading and the Brothers of the Christian Schools in eighteenth-century France","“They made neither a profession nor a commodity out of them”: printing, schoolbook trading and the Brothers of the Christian Schools in eighteenth-century France From the seventeenth century onwards, there was an increase in the number of teaching communities in France taking on the management of small charitable schools for working-class girls and boys. These communities set out in their regulations the way they wanted the classes to be run. They recommended the collective lesson method, which presupposed that all pupils who were at the same level should have the same book in their hands. This practical constraint meant that different ways of organising the provision of books to pupils emerged among these communities. One community, the Brothers of the Christian Schools, stands out in particular for its highly integrated book system, which was set up by their founder, Jean-Baptiste de La Salle. It included a common corpus for all schools, contracts with printers and direct sales to pupils. This particular aspect of the Lasallian community’s history is the focus of this article. The first section considers how both the educationists who served as models for La Salle and other contemporary communities dealt with the question of books. In the Ecole Paroissiale (1654), Jacques de Batencour described the collective lesson method but did not expand on the supply of books, which could be found in the bookshops of the parish of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet. The Ursulines, whose schools were rapidly increasing in number, did not specify a corpus of common textbooks for the whole community, but their regulations stipulated that each school must stock up on books for resale at cost price to pupils. In actual fact, they made a small profit (20–30% of the book price) to fund book donations for the poorest pupils. This operating model could be found in many female communities, such as the Vatelottes de Toul and the Sisters of Ernemont in Normandy. In Lyon, Charles Démia (1637–1689) established a learning progression method based on the use of a small canon of books that he had part-written. He did not organise the provision of the books to the pupils, but the Office of Schools (Bureau des écoles) entered into contracts with local printers to ensure a plentiful supply of the necessary books. However, as school monitoring visits showed, it was difficult to make the teachers and families use the books listed in the Règlemens pour les écoles de la ville et diocèse de Lyon (regulations for schools in the city and diocese of Lyon) (1688). The teachers continued to use whatever syllabaries and children’s devotional books their pupils brought in, such as the Heures de Notre-Dame. When La Salle founded the Brothers of the Christian Schools, he had been partly inspired by the Lyon schools model. However, he took this a step further, writing all the educational materials himself so that they corresponded with the dual catechetical and literacy mission of his foundation. This heritage did not fossilise the Brothers’ pedagogical reflection during the eighteenth century. The Lasallian syllabary was contested very early on and was gradually replaced by a more classical form of syllabary combined with the common prayers. The collection of psalms used in the schools evolved in line with musical trends. Textbooks for grammar and arithmetic, which were produced in response to the needs of the urban middle classes, were added in the 1770s. La Salle combined his specification of this corpus with the commercial organisation that was lacking in the Démia schools (but present, for example, in the Ursuline schools), whereby the Brothers sold the books that the children were to use. Drawing on local archives, the second section of this article examines the many objections generated by this “school bookshop”. Booksellers were the main opponents of this system. They appealed against the unfair competition to the royal administration, since it was theoretically forbidden for non-booksellers to practise bookselling. There were also objections from schoolteachers, who tried to discredit the Brothers by accusing them not only of making a profit on the sale of school supplies but also of favouring children from the urban middle classes over the poor, who were the supposed focus of their mission. Finally, the families themselves opposed this system because they were unhappy about the forced purchases, which conflicted with the domestic recycling practices that prevailed where school supplies were concerned. The third section of this article highlights the major breakthrough that this community-run system for producing schoolbooks represented. Production was concentrated in the community’s three provincial capitals, namely Rouen and Avignon from the early eighteenth century onwards and Nancy from the 1770s onwards. In all three cases, the provincial capital was located in a centre that was very active in terms of publishing, thus facilitating a large-scale supply to the schools. This was not just a fortuitous coincidence, because the dynamics that drove the Christian schools were not unrelated to those that maintained the prosperity of the local printing houses. In these three “letterpress capitals”, the Brothers entered into contracts with the printers, negotiated prices and acquired real expertise in printing matters. Schools located in and around these cities could be easily equipped with the corpus of books specified by their founder. For schools further afield, it is possible that the corpus was adapted according to the titles available from local printers and booksellers, as shown for the schools in Reims, Montauban and Grenoble. Although Lasallian pedagogical practice did not always adhere fully to the plan set out by its founder and while the children did not always work through the entire corpus of La Salle’s books, his schools nevertheless became the models to be followed and imitated in the closing decades of the century. With their printing presses and their bookselling teachers, the Brothers’ schools thus marked a considerable milestone in the slow diffusion of the simultaneous method of teaching in small French schools right up to the nineteenth century. © 2019 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.",0
Bilingual language experience and children's social-emotional and behavioral skills: a cross-sectional study of Singapore preschoolers,"The current study examines the relationship between bilingual children's dual language experience (i.e. language input, language output and vocabulary proficiency), and their social-emotional and behavioral skills. Data were analysed from 805 Singaporean bilingual preschoolers (ages 4; 1–5; 8 years), who are learning English and either Mandarin (n = 551), Malay (n = 105), or Tamil, (n = 149). A parent questionnaire and standardized vocabulary tests were used to assess children's bilingual language environment and vocabulary knowledge. Children's social-emotional and behavioral skills were evaluated by teachers using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. A series of variables which might influence social-emotional and behavioral skills (e.g. gender, non-verbal IQ, SES, and emotion recognition) were controlled and mixed-effects models were used to conduct data analysis. Results demonstrated that children who had larger bilingual receptive vocabulary and had frequently spoken both languages for a longer time had better social-emotional and behavioral skills. Gender and emotion recognition ability were also found to be significantly related to children's social-emotional and behavioral skills. Such findings held true for children across different Mother Tongue language backgrounds. This suggests that a good language environment for bilingual children should be promoted not only for the sake of their early language development, but also because of the potential benefits to their social-emotional and behavioral skills. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0
Attempts at putting up intellectual and spiritual resistance to the occupying authorities in Hugo Raudsepp’s comedies from the 1940s,"In the 1940s, the totalitarian occupying regimes of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union implemented the strictest control and ideological guidance of intellectual and spiritual life of all time in Estonia. Essentially, the mechanisms and results of control are known. Cultural life was subjected to strict pre-censorship and post-publication censorship, and in the Soviet era also to thematic dictation. The intellectual and spiritual resistance of Estonians in those years, in other words their refusal to accept the ruling ideology, has been studied very little. The most widespread way of putting up intellectual and spiritual resistance was to remain silent, in other words to avoid creating works that were agreeable to the authorities. Selective silence, that is the selection of one’s points of emphasis, and splitting, in other words writing for oneself works that one keeps in one’s drawer while at the same time writing for publication in print, are also placed in this category. Recording actual history in diaries through the eyes of contemporaries of events, reading intellectually and spiritually enjoyable literature, and other such actions were ways of putting up intellectual and spiritual resistance. The main objective of this study is to ascertain in historical context the attempts to put up intellectual and spiritual resistance in the comedies from the 1940s by Hugo Raudsepp (1883–1952), one of the most outstanding Estonian playwrights of the 20th century. Ideologically speaking, dramatic literature was clearly one of the most vulnerable branches of literature. It was created for public presentation in theatres, after all, for which reason authors had to be particularly careful in their wording. On the other hand, plays provided both authors and directors with opportunities to conceal messages between the lines. For this reason, theatre became exceedingly popular in Estonia by the final decades of the Soviet era. The ridicule and mocking of the Soviet regime were especially enjoyed. The subjugation of Estonian intellectual and spiritual life to the ideological requirements of the occupying regime was launched at the time of pre-war Stalinism (1940–1941). Its aim was to rear Soviet-minded people who would help to justify, fortify and enhance the Soviet regime. The systematic control of the activities of creative persons and the working out of dictates and regulations were nevertheless not yet completed during the first year of Soviet rule. Many outstanding cultural figures remained silent or earned a living by translating texts. At that time, Hugo Raudsepp wrote the non-political novel Viimne eurooplane [The Last European], which is noteworthy to this day, while his plays from the period of independent Estonian statehood were not staged in theatres. Starting with the German occupation (1941–1944), the point of departure for Hugo Raudsepp was writing between the lines in his comedies in order to get both readers and theatregoers to think and to give them strength of soul. In 1943, he wrote the comedy Vaheliku vapustused [Inter-spatial Jolts], which has later been styled as a masterpiece. He concealed numerous signs between the lines of this play referring to the fate of a small people, in other words Estonia, between its great neighbouring powers the Soviet Union and Germany. Performances of this play were soon banned. Performances in theatres of all other plays by Hugo Raudsepp were similarly banned, with one exception. During post-war Stalinism in 1944–51, the sovietisation of Estonian cultural life resumed. Hugo Raudsepp did not initially write on topical Soviet themes, rather he sought subject matter from earlier times. His first play from that period entitled Rotid [Rats] (1946) was about the German occupation during the Second World War and it ridiculed the occupying Germans. Raudsepp also skilfully wove messages supporting Estonian cultural identity into the play. The play was staged in the Estonia Theatre but was soon banned. Raudsepp’s second play from that period, Tagatipu Tiisenoosen (1946), earned first prize at the state comedy competition in that same year. The action in the play was set in the period of Estonian National Awakening at the end of the 19th century. It ridiculed Baltic Germans and the behaviour of parvenu Estonians. Similarly to his previous play, he demonstrated nationalist mentality in this comedy by way of nationalist songs. It is noteworthy that by the summer of 1947, Tagatipu Tiisenoosen had also reached expatriate Estonians and it was staged with an altered title as the only Stalinist-era play from Soviet Estonia in Canada (1952), Australia (1954) and Sweden (1956). The thematic precepts imposed on Estonian writers and the mechanism for ensuring that those precepts were followed became even stricter starting in 1947. Raudsepp wrote his next 7 plays on required Soviet subject matter: post-war land reform (Tillereinu peremehed [The Owners of Tillereinu], 1947), monetary reform (Noorsulane Ilmar [Ilmar the Young Farmhand], 1948), kolkhozes (Küpsuseksam [Matriculation Exam] and Lasteaed [Kindergarten], 1949, Mineviku köidikuis [In the Fetters of the Past] (1950) and his so-called Viimane näidend [Last Play], 1950 or 1951), and the beginning of the Soviet regime in Estonia in 1940 (Pööripäevad Kikerpillis [Solstices in Kikerpill], 1949). Hugo Raudsepp skilfully wove words of wisdom for Estonians on surviving under foreign rule through the mouths of his characters, or discreetly laughed about Soviet reality in a way that the censors did not grasp. Post-war cultural policy culminated with the 8th Plenum of the Estonian Communist (Bolshevist) Party (EC(B)P) Central Committee on 21–26 March 1950, where among other things, the EC(B)P Central Committee Bureau was accused of allowing the exaltation of the superiority of Western European science and culture. Cultural figures were branded bourgeois nationalists and they faced serious ordeals. The fate of the great figure of Estonian dramatic literature was very harsh. Hugo Raudsepp was depicted as a ‘fascist henchman’ in 1950. He was expelled from the Estonian Writers’ Union and was deprived of his personal pension. He was arrested on 11 May 1951. Opposition to the Soviet regime was stressed in the charges presented to him. His play Vaheliku vapustused, which the German occupying regime had banned, and his only play that was allowed at that time, Lipud tormis [Flags in the Storm], were named as the primary evidence supporting the charges. Hugo Raudsepp was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the autumn of 1951. He hoped to the last possible moment that he would be allowed to serve his sentence in Estonia. Unfortunately, on 18 February 1952 he was sent by train from Tallinn to Narva and on 19 February on to Leningrad. From there his journey took him to Vjatka, Kirov and finally Irkutsk oblast. This great man’s health was poor, and he soon died on 15 September 1952. Very few new literary works appeared in the 1940s. The historical nadir is altogether seen in post-war book production in the era of Stalinism. Estonian theatre was similarly in a most difficult situation due to censorship, shortage of repertoire, scarcity of funding, and layoffs and sackings of theatre personnel. Nowadays the survival of theatre at the time, regardless of difficult times, is appreciated, and actors are recognised for preserving Estonian identity and uniting the people. Hugo Raudsepp’s role as a playwright in supporting intellectual and spiritual resistance to foreign authorities has to be recognised on the basis of his occupation-era comedies. Hugo Raudsepp was one of the most productive authors of his day, writing a total of 11 plays in 1943–51. According to the assessment of scholars of literature, he never once rose with these works to the leading-edge level of his previous works. It was impossible to create masterpieces that would become classics in that time of strict ideological precepts and the monitoring of their observance. Taking into consideration the extremely restricted creative conditions, his works were still masterpieces of their time. As Hugo Raudsepp’s oeuvre demonstrates, spirit still managed to cleverly trump power regardless of censorship and official precepts. The denunciation of Stalin’s personality cult in 1956 once again opened the door to the theatre for Hugo Raudsepp’s best comedies from Estonia’s era of independent statehood. The witticism and laughter of Hugo Raudsepp’s comedies gave people renewed strength of soul. © 2020 University of Tartu Press. All rights reserved.",0
Assessing master students’ competencies using rubrics: Lessons learned from future secondary education teachers,"The aim of this paper is to provide insights into the appropriateness of teaching-learning and evaluation processes using rubrics, for student self-assessments. We studied students enrolled on the Master’s in Secondary Education Teaching—Music Specialism course. In the Spanish secondary education system, music is seen as increasing equity and improving student performance in line with the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The training of new teachers and the ongoing professional development of the current teaching force are critical for improving the quality of education. We adopted an action-research approach and obtained feedback from the Masters’ students via questionnaires administered at the start and end of the process (pre-and post-test). Our results show that using rubrics as formative and shared assessment tools has a positive influence on students’ perceptions of their acquisition of both transversal and specific competencies, as well as demonstrating the utility of rubrics for their future professional practice. However, rubrics on their own are not sufficient to increase the facility for learning and awareness among students. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0
Exposures to EFL Reading in Primary School and Impact on Writing,"Literacy in English as a Foreign Language has not been taken into serious consideration in Indonesian primary schools. Even though English is not a compulsory subject in this level of school, the majority of elementary schools in urban areas in Bali start introducing the foreign language since Grade 3. This research aimed at establishing basic literacy skills in English language in primary schools through exposures to simple English reading activities. The exposures include reading with and without guidance from the teacher. 32 children of Grade 4 were involved in the ‘once a week reading in English program’, comprising reading aloud, shared reading, and related activities such as games and songs. The stories read in the classroom were then displayed on a reading corner board so that children could read at their convenient time. Data were collected through participatory observation, students’ writing, and anecdotal journal. The findings reveal that exposures to reading materials have a positive impact on children’s awareness of language use that positively influence their ability to write in English. Exposures to EFL reading should combine guided and unguided reading activities so children develop strategies to read and write in English. © 2020 Asian E F L Journal Press. All rights reserved.",0
The development of academic and nonacademic race stereotypes in African American adolescents,"The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine developmental change and gender differences in the Black-White race stereotype endorsement of African American adolescents. In Grades 7, 10, and 12, African American students (N = 563; 313 girls) reported their perceptions of the competence of Blacks and Whites in academic, music, and sports domains. Multilevel growth modeling (MLM) was used to assess change from Grade 7 to Grade 12. Separate models tested academic (English, math, science) and nonacademic (music and sports) stereotypes. Across time points, students reported higher competence for Whites than Blacks in English, math, and science and higher competence for Blacks in music and sports. Academic stereotype endorsement increased between Grades 7 and 10, and students' endorsement of music and sports stereotypes decreased over time. Girls endorsed race stereotypes favoring Whites in math and science more strongly than boys. Boys reported stronger sports stereotypes than girls. Results highlight the value of intersectional approaches to studying stereotypes, as factors linked to gender identity may play a role in Black youths' race stereotype endorsement. © 2020 American Psychological Association.",0
Multimedia Input and Bilingual Children’s Language Learning,"The current study seeks to explore the impact of multimedia input at home on bilingual children’s language outcomes. Two hundred and two Singaporean English-Mandarin kindergarteners’ multimedia experience (i.e., the resources and the amount of multimedia input) and conventional language exposure (e.g., language use with family members) were investigated with a parental questionnaire. A series of English and Mandarin tests were conducted to assess children’s proficiency (i.e., in receptive vocabulary, receptive grammar, verbal fluency) by standardized measures. Results demonstrated that the diversity of multimedia input is more important than the amount of multimedia input in promoting children’s Mandarin language maintenance, while controlling for children’s conventional language exposure, SES, and language aptitude. The number of multimedia sources is significantly and positively related to children’s general Mandarin proficiency. In contrast, English multimedia exposure at home exerts little impact on children’s general English proficiency. The findings indicate the unique contribution of multimedia diversity to children’s early heritage language maintenance. The strong social relevance of the study is discussed at the end of the paper. © Copyright © 2020 Sun and Yin.",0
Children aged 6 to 12 transport in Greater Jakarta,"In Indonesia, it is compulsory for children aged 7 to 12 years to attend primary school. However, some parents with 6 years old children enroll them in private primary school. Therefore, school transport becomes one of the most important parts of children mobility including in Greater Jakarta. Other activity on weekdays might include attending foreign languages courses, joining sports clubs, attending musical courses, etc. To support their mobility, parents prepare various options including private motorized vehicles, public transport, and pick-up/ drop-off services. This paper is intended to discuss the children readiness level to be transported by these three options. All answers were provided by the parents both for readiness of their children to be transported and their children personal qualities in terms of their self-reliance, liveliness & physical skill, emotion, decision making skill, and closeness with the parents. These five children personal qualities were then correlated with their readiness to be transported in three different ways. Pearson Correlation was conducted at 0.05 significant level between three children personal qualities and their readiness (both before and during the travel) to be transported. In general, emotion was the only children personal quality that was not related to readiness to be transported. © 2020 Polish Psychological Bulletin. All rights reserved.",0
The German Music@Home: Validation of a questionnaire measuring at home musical exposure and interaction of young children,"The present study introduces the German version of the original version of the Music@Home questionnaire developed in the UK, which systematically evaluates musical engagement in the home environment of young children. Two versions are available, an Infant version for children aged three to 23 months and a Preschool version for children aged two to five and a half years. For the present study, the original Music@Home questionnaire was translated from English into German and 656 caregivers completed the questionnaire online. A confirmatory factor analysis showed moderate to high fit indices for both versions, confirming the factor structure of the original questionnaire. Also, the reliability coefficients for the subscales (Parental beliefs, Child engagement with music, Parent initiation of singing, Parent initiation of music-making for the Infant version and Parental beliefs, Child engagement with music, Parent initiation of music behavior and Breadth of musical exposure for the Preschool version) ranged from moderate to high fits. Furthermore, the test-retest analysis (N = 392) revealed high correlations for the general factor and all subscales confirming their internal reliability. Additionally, we included language questionnaires for children of two and three years of age. Results showed that higher scores on the Music@Home questionnaire were moderately associated with better language skills in two-year-olds (N = 118). In sum, the study presents the validated German Music@Home questionnaire, which shows good psychometric properties. The two versions of the questionnaire are available for use in order to assess home musical engagement of young children, which could be of interest in many areas of developmental research. © 2020 Schaal et al.

The influence of postoperative environment on patient pain and satisfaction: a randomized trial,"Background: Improving the patient experience, controlling pain with nonopiate therapies, and preparing for value-based reimbursement are increasingly important foci for both physicians and hospitals. Objective: We aimed to determine whether the addition of music and a natural landscape image to postoperative hospital rooms would result in improved pain and satisfaction scores among inpatients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery. Study Design: This randomized controlled trial was approved by an Institutional Review Board. Eligible candidates were 18–85 years old, English speaking, and scheduled to undergo native tissue vaginal vault suspension for symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. Patients with history of a chronic pain or substance abuse were excluded. Subjects were advised that the purpose of the study was to assess the effect of changes to the hospital environment on patient experience but were blinded to their group and intervention details. Changes included a landscape image mounted to the wall and access to a speaker with preprogrammed music selections. The intervention group was instructed to listen to their preferred music for a minimum of 2 30-minute sessions postoperatively. The control group had a standard hospital room, without music or landscape. All patient rooms were private. The primary outcome was the visual analog scale for pain in the morning of postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes included narcotic use, likelihood to refer family to the same hospital facility, satisfaction with care and the hospital, and perception of a healing environment. A sample size of 43 subjects per arm was calculated to detect a difference of 10 mm in visual analog scale pain score. Results: A total of 133 subjects were enrolled; primary outcome data were available for 92 (46 per arm). The mean age was 63.8 (standard deviation, 9.5) years, median Charlson comorbidity score was 2 (min, 0; max, 7), and 94.6% of subjects were white. On postoperative day 1, median visual analog scale pain scores were low (28.8 mm [0, 86]; 24.5 mm [0, 81]) and did not differ between intervention and control, respectively (P=.57). Total morphine equivalents (P=.817) and nursing pain scores (P=.774) were also similar. However, the intervention group displayed a higher likelihood to refer family members to the hospital (98 mm (47, 100); 96 mm (65, 100); P=.037). At postoperative 2 weeks, the intervention group indicated higher satisfaction with their care (98 mm, (34, 100); 95 mm (42, 100); P=.032), the hospital (98 mm (71, 100); 94 mm (6, 100); P=.004), and the healing environment provided during their stay (98 mm; 92 mm (19, 100); P=.020) than those in the standard hospital rooms. Conclusion: In this randomized trial, we found music and landscape imagery did not substantially affect postoperative pain scores; however, they had a positive effect on the postoperative experience. Furthermore, this effect appeared to broaden 2 weeks after surgery. Given the importance of value-based care, interventions such as these should be emphasized to enhance patient satisfaction, quality scores, and overall well-being. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0
Beneficial Effects of Musicality on the Development of Productive Phonology Skills in Second Language Acquisition,"Previous studies show beneficial effects of musicality on the acquisition of a second language (L2). While most research focused on perceptual aspects, only few studies investigated the effects of musicality on productive phonology. The present study tested if musicality can predict productive phonological skills in L2 acquisition. Sixty-three students with no previous exposure to Arabic were asked to repeatedly listen to and immediately reproduce short sentences in standard Arabic. Before the sentence reproduction task, they completed an auditory discrimination task in three different between-subjects condition: attentive, in which participants were asked to discriminate phonological variations in the same Arabic sentence that they were asked to reproduce later; non-attentive, in which participants were asked to detect beeps in the same Arabic sentences without paying attention to their phonological content; and no-exposure, in which participants performed the discrimination task in another language (Serbian). The first, third and seventh reproductions of each participant were rated for intelligibility, accent, and syllabic errors by two independent evaluators, both native speakers of Arabic. Primary results showed that the intelligibility of the reproduced sentences was higher in participants with high musicality scores in the Advanced Measures of Music Audiation. Moreover, the intelligibility of sentences produced by highly musical participants improved more over time than the intelligibility of participants with lower musicality scores. Previous exposure to the Arabic sentence was beneficial in both the attentive and non-attentive conditions. Our results support the idea that musicality can have effects on productive skills even in the very first stages of L2 acquisition. © Copyright © 2020 Delogu and Zheng.",0
Song and infant-directed speech facilitate word learning,"Two separate lines of research have examined the influence of song and infant-directed speech (IDS-a speech register that includes some melodic features) on language learning, suggesting that the use of musical attributes in speech input can enhance language learning. However, the benefits of these two types of stimuli have never been directly compared. In this investigation, we compared the effects of song and IDS for immediate word learning and long-term memory of the learned words. This study examines whether the highly musical stimuli (i.e., song) would facilitate language learning more than the less musical stimuli (i.e., IDS). English-speaking adults were administered a word learning task, with Mandarin Chinese words presented in adult-directed speech (ADS), IDS, or song. Participants' word learning performance was assessed immediately after the word learning task (immediate word learning) and then 1 day later (long-term memory). Results showed that both song and IDS facilitated immediate word learning and long-term memory of the words; however, this facilitative effect did not differ between IDS and song, suggesting that the relationship between the degree of musicality and language learning performance is not linear. In addition, song and IDS were found to facilitate the word association process (mapping a label to its referent) rather than the word recognition process. Finally, participants' confidence in their answers might not differ among ADS, IDS, and sung words.",0
Media language preferences and mental illness stigma among Latinx adolescents,"Purpose: Media—a powerful influence on mental illness stigma—varies by language and culture. Nevertheless, recent meta-analyses have demonstrated scant attention to Spanish language media as well as historically low Latinx participation in mental illness anti-stigma intervention. To better inform how to improve equity in mental health service utilization, this study assessed how language preferences in mass media influence stigma among Latinx adolescents, compared to family language and social preferences. Methods: Sixth-graders self-identifying as Latinx self-completed assessments of mental illness knowledge/positive attitudes and desired separation from peers and adolescent vignette characters experiencing mental illness (N = 179; Texas, U.S., 2011–2012). Participants also responded to measures of language preferences (any Spanish versus only English) for consuming media (film/television, music/radio) and speaking with family (parents/grandparents), and social preferences for parties or social gatherings (Latinx versus Anglo persons). Linear regression models adjusting for student and household factors examined the associations between media and family language and social preferences on mental illness stigma. Results: Latinx adolescents preferring any Spanish versus English-only media reported less mental illness knowledge/positive attitudes and greater social separation from peers and vignette characters with a mental illness, net of all covariates. Family language and social preferences were not associated with any mental illness stigma outcomes. Conclusions: Spanish media preference is associated with greater stigma suggesting more stigmatization may exist in Spanish- versus English-media. Ensuring anti-stigma messaging in Spanish media may reduce disparities in mental illness stigma among Latinx adolescents. These findings have implications for populations with other non-English media preferences. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0
"She thinks in english, but she wants in mandarin: Differences in singaporean bilingual english-mandarin maternal mental-state-talk","Chinese-speaking parents are believed to use less cognitive mental-state-talk than their English-speaking counterparts on account of their cultural goals in socializing their children to follow an interdependence script. Here, we investigated bilingual English-Mandarin Singaporean mothers who associate different functions for each language as prescribed by their government: English for school and Mandarin for in-group contexts. English and Mandarin maternal mental-state-talk from bilingual English-Mandarin mothers with their toddlers was examined. Mothers produced more ''cognitive""terms in English than in Mandarin and more ''desire""terms in Mandarin than in English. We show that mental-state-talk differs between bilingual parents' languages, suggesting that mothers adjust their mental-state-talk to reflect the functions of each language. © 2020 by the authors.",0
The use of Voca-lens to enhance the students’ vocabulary repertoire,"Education has shifted to the digital era. The primary pupils whom known as the alpha generation, grow up with technology, were no longer passive learners. Information and communications technology (ICT) is used as teaching tool in which claims to help in dissemination of learning contents. English language educators play the role to bridge the gap between ICT and English language teaching in order to optimize its benefits in education field. This current study which employs mixed method triangulation design model is intended to (1) enhance the repertoire of vocabulary and (2) reading motivation among primary pupils. A total of 56 respondents were chosen from 3 schools in Song and Mukah. The quantitative data was collected from pre and post tests of reading comprehension achievement test to answer first research question. Quantitative data from semantic differential scale questionnaire which comprises of 20 items was analysed to answer the second research question. It was also justified by qualitative data from semi structured interview. The positive findings from the three instruments showed the effectiveness of Vocalens. The innovation of Vocalens could be further utilized in the lesson if the availability of devices and internet connection were enhanced. © 2020 AESS Publications. All Rights Reserved.",0
Thinking outside the box: Turkish EFL teachers’ perceptions of creativity,"Creativity is one of the essential 21st-century skills that need to be developed in students because we are living in an age that is ever-changing and unpredictable. Students should be encouraged to think outside the box not only through subjects like art, music, science, literature, etc. but also in educational settings like English as a foreign language (EFL) classes. Teachers certainly have the most significant role in fostering students’ creative thinking abilities by implementing creative teaching in their lessons. Thus, the aim of the study is to explore the perceptions of Turkish EFL teachers about creativity and their creative teaching practices. It was designed as a qualitative research; interviews were held to probe in-depth into their perceptions on creativity. In line with the aim of the study, the research questions were determined as follows: 1) What does creativity mean to Turkish EFL teachers? 2) What kind of creative teaching activities do Turkish EFL teachers utilize in their classrooms? 3) What are the factors affecting creative teaching and learning? As the instrument, an interview form was prepared to collect data by reviewing relevant literature and consulting the specialists’ views. The researchers conducted interviews with fifteen secondary school EFL teachers, chosen randomly. They participated in research from different schools voluntarily. The participants were selected regarding their schools’ socio-economic position, their experience, gender and age to prove a general perspective of creativity. The data obtained from the interviews were analyzed through qualitative content analysis. The findings have revealed that the majority of the teachers are not aware of the central philosophy of creativity, and they do not apply a creative approach in their teaching. However, it is indicated that they use several activities in their classrooms like brainstorming, games, snap-words, and storytelling to encourage creativity. It is emphasized that there are factors constraining creativity and their creative teaching practices such as content-heavy curriculum, exam-oriented education, students, limited course duration and technology. On the other hand, there are factors facilitating creativity, like teacher motivation, technology and students. It is worth noting that ‘technology’ and ‘students’ were addressed both as facilitating and constraining factors. This study explored the perceptions of Turkish EFL teachers about creativity and their creative teaching practices. It is hoped to contribute to the field with valuable results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
Teaching stress-timed rhythm of english at the japanese elementary school level: Focusing on the effects of using chants,"It is noted that suprasegmental features such as stress, rhythm and intonation are notoriously challenging for educators to teach. The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of learning English stress-timed rhythm using chants with Japanese elementary school children as a study subject. The goal is to see which effects this technique has on overall intelligibility. Using a quantitative research design in experimental conditions, arranged as a controlled field-experiment, the cause-and-effect factors of chants were used as a treatment on subjects to find any possible effects on intelligibility output thereafter. Using empirical procedures (gathered through voice-recording technology), this study made use of independent t-testing, Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficients, Gain Scores, Stepwise Multiple Regression and Tolerance Correlations to explore the dataset. In this paper, ninety-one elementary school children were instructed on English pronunciation. Sentence stress was visualized to promote awareness and understanding of the differences between the syllable-timed rhythm of Japanese and the stress-timed rhythm of English throughout the student body involved. Three different types of methods were utilized: 1) English rhythm swaying, 2) reciting aloud with rhythm, and 3) reciting aloud with music. Pre and Post instruction, recordings of students’ pronunciations were taken. Then, using a criteria compiled of measures of intelligibility, experienced native-level teachers of EFL evaluated the recorded data. The outcomes of the analysis suggest that explicit teaching of the prosodic features of pronunciation using chants has a significant effect on intelligibility. Even though sentence-level stress was focused in this study, there was a significant improvement in pronunciation skills and overall intelligibility was found to be effected more by segmental features when compared to sentence-level stress. This could be due to the fact that the young learners have a tendency to pay more attention to pronunciation than stress when they are asked to pronounce English phrases or sentences. © 2020 Asian E F L Journal Press.

"From Prussia with Love: Music at Uppingham School, 1853–1908","Music played little part in the education of British children before 1853 when Edward Thring was appointed headmaster of Uppingham Grammar School in the English Midlands. Thring created an innovative holistic curriculum for the two dozen boys of this rural boarding school and he appointed a musician as the third addition to his staff to form a teaching faculty of five; by the time of Thring’s death in 1887 and a school roll now three hundred, the full-time music team numbered six. Almost all came from Prussia: early appointments stayed only a year or two but later ones, including Paul David—""Music and Choir Master”—made Uppingham their permanent home. Over the course of four decades, David—a member of the Mendelssohn and Schumann circle, and friend of Brahms and Sterndale Bennett—raised music to a high level of distinction and a broad level of participation beyond all other schools and, through his lifelong friendship with Josef Joachim, he attracted many celebrated musicians to perform to and play alongside his boys. None of this, however, would have happened but for a chance meeting in Rome in 1852. © The Author(s) 2018.",0
The role and outcomes of music listening for women in childbirth: An integrative review,"Aim: To synthesise primary research on the role and use of music listening for women in childbirth. Design: Integrative review. Methods: Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) five-stage integrative review method was utilized to complete a systematic search of the literature. Studies were included if they were (a) peer-reviewed, (b) written in the English language, (c) published between 1 January 1979 and 5 April 2019 and (d) described the use of music listening during labour and birth. Studies were appraised for quality and methodological rigor using standardised assessment tools including the Critical Appraisal Skills Programmes (CASP) checklist for the qualitative studies and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for the quasi-experimental studies and randomised control trials. Data extrapolation, methodological quality assessment and Thematic Content Analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) were carried out. Findings: A total of 931 articles were retrieved and 24 papers were included in the review (12 randomized controlled trials, 9 quasi-experimental and 3 qualitative). The quality of the studies was moderately good overall. Two overarching themes emerged including ‘outcomes of using music in childbirth’ and, ‘music application during childbirth’. Within ‘outcomes of using music in childbirth’ four subthemes are described: ‘pain’, ‘anxiety’, ‘psychological supports’ and ‘progression of labour’. Within ‘music application during childbirth’ four themes are presented: ‘timing of the music application’, ‘type of music’, ‘birth preparation using music’ and ‘mode of music listening’. Conclusion and implications for practice: The findings indicate that music listening has a significant role to play for women in childbirth. This non-pharmacological intervention can reduce pain and anxiety while offering a multifaceted form of psychological support to alleviate stress and promote an increased sense of control in women during labour. However, further awareness is needed around the idiosyncratic nature of the music listening experience. © 2020",0
Transcription of Vietnamese Adults' and Children's Consonants by English-Speaking Speech-Language Pathologists,"Objective: To examine English-speaking speech-language pathologists' (SLPs) transcription of consonants in Vietnamese words and identification of correct/incorrect productions of Vietnamese children's speech. Participants and Methods: Twenty English-speaking SLPs completed three tasks. Task 1: Transcription of 22 English words using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Task 2: Transcription of 47 words spoken by Vietnamese adults. Task 3: Transcription of 94 Vietnamese words spoken by Vietnamese children and identification of correct/incorrect productions. Participants completed questionnaires exploring language proficiency, transcription skill, musicality and confidence with multilingual clients. Results: Task 1: Participants demonstrated good accuracy transcribing English words (M = 97.2%). Task 2: An average of 52.9% consonants were transcribed correctly (89.4% when Vietnamese-English common transcription errors were considered). Common transcription errors included voicing of plosives, place and syllable-final omission. Accuracy was higher on shared English and Vietnamese consonantal articulations (e.g.,/b/and/m/). Task 3: On average, SLPs correctly identified accuracy of 73.8% of Vietnamese children's productions and transcribed 69.2% consonants correctly (83.8% when Vietnamese-English common transcription errors were considered). Musicality was correlated with SLPs' accuracy of transcription. Conclusion: English-speaking SLPs have some skills transcribing Vietnamese adults and transcribing and identifying correct/incorrect productions of children's speech. SLPs may use knowledge of common transcription errors to support understanding of their transcription of speech. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.",0
Intrapersonal skills and music performance in elementary piano students in Spanish conservatories: Three case studies,"This study is based on the premise that emotional skills—comprised of an intrapersonal dimension and an interpersonal dimension—help to achieve personal balance, which in turn can enhance performance. Following from this premise, the improvement of music students’ emotional skills might have a positive effect on their musical performance. The recognized relationship between music and emotion therefore suggests that music education is a suitable context for developing emotional skills. The article examines the relationship between intrapersonal skills and the musical performance of elementary students studying the piano in a Spanish conservatory. The research was developed as an action research process and involved the study of three 10-year-old students. A set of activities were designed specifically for students attending the third course of piano studies; these activities were intended to develop students’ intrapersonal skills throughout the school year and were implemented in the subjects of piano and ensemble playing in parallel with the musical tasks. The relationship between intrapersonal skills and musical performance is investigated and discussed for each of the three cases. © The Author(s) 2019.",0
The Relationship Between L2 Phonological Processing and Early Musical Training in Adult Bilinguals,"Bilinguals who speak English as their second-learnt (L2), yet dominant language from a young age, have been previously shown to experience difficulties in adulthood when dealing with spoken English (i.e., phonological processing) compared to native monolinguals. The present study investigated whether the processing disadvantage in this group of bilinguals could be modulated by engagement in early musical training, a practice that, like phonological processing, requires the complex manipulation of sounds. To this end, performance on three English auditory processing tasks (phoneme deletion, spelling-to-dictation, and auditory comprehension) was measured in early L2-dominant bilingual and native English monolingual adults who had or had never received early musical training. The processing difficulties that were detected in bilingual adults without musical training were completely absent in those who had received formal musical training as children, such that performance was matched with their monolingual counterparts. The results indicate that early musical training has the potential to be an effective long-term intervention for individuals who experience weakness in phonological processing. © The Author(s) 2020.",0
Analyzing Singing Abilities and Language Skills during The Elementary School Years,"As part of the AIRS project examining children’s singing cross-culturally and developmentally, using the AIRS Test Battery of Singing Skills (ATBSS), we report results from testing 104 English children, aged between 4 and 9 years on three components. The results summarize a number of associations between singing and language skills, and children’s abilities to reproduce musical patterns. The findings indicate the variability in the singing skills of the youngest children, and distinctions between lyrical and verbal fluency. Concluding comments consider the significance and potential of the AIRS digital library for future research in this area. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",0
Lexical-Tonal Perception Development in Infancy,"The innate capacities and developmental mechanisms involved in infants’ acquisition of their native language are basic topics in speech perception development. Developmental trends regarding infants’ perceptions of phonetic segments have been well documented over the past decades; however, studies on the development of “lexical tones,” which represent a phonetic unit unique to tonal languages, have only begun to emerge in the last decade. This chapter reviews studies on tonal perception development in infants learning a tonal language (e.g., Mandarin and Cantonese) or a nontonal-language (e.g., English and Dutch). These studies have demonstrated that infants learning a nontonal-language are able to discriminate tonal contrasts at the age of 4–6 months, but they cannot easily distinguish the same tonal contrasts at the age of 9–12 months. Conversely, infants exposed to a tonal language exhibited superior ability to discriminate tonal contrasts at the age of approximately 12 months. The trend of lexical-tone learning is similar to that by which infants learn phonetic segments. Developmental factors for tonal perception include experience listening to the native language, the acoustic salience of lexical tones, statistical learning, musical tone exposure, and referential word learning. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",0
German dialects of the Tomsk and Novosibirsk regions (based on the open online archive of German dialects in Siberia),"The paper interprets the data from the open online archive of German dialects (https:// www.tomdeutsche.ru/dialects/). This work was started ten years ago in Tomsk by Prof. Z. M. Bogoslovskaya and her students. The archive provides the records of the native dialects and folklore of Russian Germans whose speech originates from different mother tongues and has different degrees of preservation. Archival materials were collected on the territory of Tomsk and Novosibirsk regions during linguistic expeditions of recent years. Many dialects of the upper German and middle German types appear to be mixed, containing (primarily in phonological terms) the features of different dialect systems, mixed as early as last century. These are secondary language formations that are exclusively spoken by older people. It is not the case in the German-Mennonite dialect (Plautdietsch), which is based on the Low German language substrate. This dialect has a higher degree of preservation and is spoken not only by older people but also by young people and children. The genre component of the collected samples of folklore and religious practices does not show much diversity. The archive contains only a few samples of songs, ditties, and jokes that old speakers can still perform in their native dialect. A special role is played by literary German - it is the language of liturgical practices, of prayers and spiritual singing. The paper presents a number of dialect material transcriptions. © 2020 Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Philology. All rights reserved.",0
Master in music teacher education: Analysis of programs from the perspective of the knowledge-based society and economy,"The goal of this article is to analyse the adequacy of the written programs offered by Spanish universities in relation to the training of High School music teachers to the demands of schools and music classrooms in the knowledge-based society and economy. To reach this goal, a comparative documentary analysis of the programs of 26 Masters that offer music teacher education in Spain is executed. The results both in a general way, describing denominations, competences, structures, and credits of the programs; as well as in a specific way, defining typologies in the musical modules and practical training are presented. The conclusion is drawn that certain programs promote the construction of fundamental capacities to respond to the knowledge-based society and economy, such as reflective collective thinking and interdisciplinarity, creative thinking and entrepreneurship, technological integration, and innovation, as well as sensitivity to social issues. Although currently this is not the most common university orientation, since music teacher programs are still focused on the adaptation and perpetuation of eminently academic models, it does offer a positive vision of a commitment to teacher training that is desirable for all university programs. © 2020 Universitat de Valencia, Faculty of Teaching.

Teacher’s strategies of managing classroom and students’ response: A case study,"The success and smoothness of education cannot be separated from a classroom management. In managing the classroom, a teacher usually places a physical environment, a psycho-social environment, manages and monitors classroom activities. The classroom management often makes the teacher feels frustrated, pessimistic, and gives up when s/he is teaching the students because s/he does not know how to apply good classroom management. There is an English teacher who is not graduated from an educational field but she is able to manage her class well. Her students come from various ethnic, socio-economic backgrounds and multi-level language skills. This study investigated how English teacher in Private Junior High School in Klaten Regency managed the classroom and how the students responded to the teacher’s strategies. Data collected through observation, field note and interview. An English teacher and eight students were involved. The data showed that the teacher had created a physical environment by providing classrooms that are clean, cool, and bright and arranged the students’ seats based on the classroom activities. In responding to the physical environment, most of students seemed comfortable. In creating a psycho-social environment, she made the rules of classroom, maintained good interactions, spoke clearly and sounds, guided and gave models the assignments, moved between students’ seats, made several attempts to motivate the students, and provided reinforcement and feedback as well. The teacher also organized the time and used the various techniques such as lecturing, questioning-answering, discussions, songs, games, individual and group work. In addition, she monitored the class activities well so that the students actively did the assignments. Meanwhile, the students enjoyed a variety of teaching techniques. © 2020, Ankara University.

A corpus linguistic perspective on contemporary German pop lyrics with the multi-layer annotated « songkorpus»,"Song lyrics can be considered as a text genre that has features of both written and spoken discourse, and potentially provides extensive linguistic and cultural information to scientists from various disciplines. However, pop songs play a rather subordinate role in empirical language research so far - most likely due to the absence of scientifically valid and sustainable resources. The present paper introduces a multiply annotated corpus of German lyrics as a publicly available basis for multidisciplinary research. The resource contains three types of data for the investigation and evaluation of quite distinct phenomena: TEI-compliant song lyrics as primary data, linguistically and literary motivated annotations, and extralinguistic metadata. It promotes empirically/statistically grounded analyses of genre-specific features, systemic-structural correlations and tendencies in the texts of contemporary pop music. The corpus has been stratified into thematic and author-specific archives; the paper presents some basic descriptive statistics, as well as the public online frontend with its built-in evaluation forms and live visualisations. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC",0
The language and non-language benefits of literature in foreign language education: An exploratory study of learners’ views,"Set against the backcloth of increasing recognition and attention to literature in foreign language education (FLE) globally, this article reports part of a large-scale study of 1,190 secondary-level learners’ views of the benefits of literature, as instantiated by short stories (ShS) and poems and songs (PS) in their English-as-a-foreign-language learning. An inventory of 27 items (13 language-related and 14 non-language-related) was compiled with reference to previous studies and curricular documents. The analyses compared the two modules through independent t-tests, as well as including an exploratory factor analysis to examine latent factors. Findings reveal a three factor structure and a slightly positive view of the benefits of literature. ShS were perceived to be generally more beneficial than PS, especially in the domains of generic skills and work/studies. There were benefits common to ShS and PS, which by extension, may be universal to literary texts at large. This study makes a theoretical contribution by unveiling the potential value of literature in FLE and the three underlying factors of its perceived benefits. Practically, the inventory can be used by foreign language (FL) teachers to measure students’ perceptions to inform their use of literature in FLE. © The Author(s) 2020.",0
Modelling Multiple Language Learning in a Developmental Cognitive Architecture,"In this work, we model multiple natural language learning in a developmental neuroscience-inspired architecture. The ANNABELL model (Artificial Neural Network with Adaptive Behaviour Exploited for Language Learning), is a large-scale neural network, however, unlike most deep learning methods that solve natural language processing (NLP) tasks, it does not represent an empirical engineering solution for specific NLP problems; rather, its organisation complies with findings from cognitive neuroscience, particularly the multi-compartment working memory models. The system is appropriately trained to understand the level of cognitive development required for language acquisition and the robustness achieved in learning simultaneously four languages, using a corpus of text-based exchanges of developmental complexity. The selected languages, Greek, Italian and Albanian, besides English, differ significantly in structure and complexity. Initially, the system was validated in each language alone and was then compared with the open-ended cumulative training, in which languages are learned jointly, prior to querying with random language at random order. We aimed to assess if the model could learn the languages together to the same degree of skill as learning each apart. Moreover, we explored the generalisation skill in multilingual context questions and the ability to elaborate a short text of preschool literature. We verified if the system could follow a dialogue coherently and cohesively, keeping track of its previous answers and recalling them in subsequent queries. The results show that the architecture developed broad language processing functionalities, with satisfactory performances in each language trained singularly, maintaining high accuracies when they are acquired cumulatively.

Musical text: An effective instrument in teaching language and culture,"Studying musical text effectively reinforces grammar structures and vocabulary taught in class while simultaneously developing cultural literacy, a critical component in second language acquisition. Musical text facilitates a multimodal learning experience as it combines the verbal and aural modes, and is often accompanied by the visual mode. In addition, studies have shown that there is a strong connection between music, visual mental imagery and memory, which is beneficial for language learning. What is unique to the study of musical text is that there is sound, and sound has meaning. In tone languages, a change in pitch changes word meaning, while intonation and phonology influence meaning in non-tone languages. Voice code, experiential meaning potential and provenance further assist in conveying the meaning of the text. Whether using music as a complement to reinforce topics introduced in traditionally structured language courses or as the basis for an entire syllabus of university level language study, the following case studies demonstrate that musical text can be a powerful instrument in enhancing language acquisition not only for children, but also in the context of higher education. © 2020 International Visual Literacy Association.",0
Games as STEAM learning enhancers. Application of traditional Jamaican games in Early Childhood and Primary Intercultural Education,"Background: Despite its social importance, the learning associated with STEAM thinking (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) we consider is not fully developed in classrooms. Objectives: This research proposes to promote STEAM skills through game-based learning.. Design: These were used to design an integrated educational proposal, called the Micro Play Project (MPL), following the principles of game-based learning and an intercultural approach focused on Ethnomathematics. Setting and Participants: This MPL was implemented in a Spanish school with small groups of students from Pre-school and Primary Education, dedicating three sessions to each of the four games, which were recorded on video. Data collection and analysis: Studying the Jamaican culture, we discovered that the game is a relevant cultural sign in Jamaica, we compiled and analyzed its traditional games, generating a catalog, from which we selected four games, for their potential to develop STEAM learning at school.Qualitative-interpretive research was carried out through a case study and content analysis, using a proprietary tool. Results: they are diverse skills, artistic, scientific and mathematical manifested when playing, such as: musical sense, detection of similarities, ability to turn, identification of shapes, estimation of distances, formulation of hypotheses and establishment of relationships by criteria, which have confirmed the didactic potential of these games, in an environment of ethnomathematical intercultural education. Conclusions: The validity of the MPL as a didactic method to develop STEAM learning is deduced from the results. We hope to strengthen and spread this method by making new elaborations and applications of MPL. © 2020 Lutheran University of Brazil. All rights reserved.",0
The Use of Music by Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease,"Pain is common and often severe in people with sickle cell disease (SCD), occurring as acute intermittent pain episodes called vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs), as well as chronic pain conditions including bone infarctions, avascular necrosis of joints, and neuropathic pain. Analgesics such as opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), and anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain, although often necessary to manage these types of pain, are associated with side effects. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as to listening to music and music therapy may reduce pain. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the use of music by adolescents and young adults with SCD was helpful, and if so, the types of music that helped, and how music helped them. A convenience sample of nine English-speaking inpatients ages 13 to 21 years, with SCD and at least two prior hospitalizations for VOE, took part in interviews with music therapists. Participants were asked open-ended questions about both pain and music. Participants identified that music was helpful for pain relief as well as for mood regulation, focusing attention during cognitive tasks such as homework, distraction, relaxation, and feeling understood or connected with others. Despite this, while hospitalized, participants reported that they did not tend to use music to help with pain. These findings support the use of both music medicine and music therapy as interventions for pain and distress in adolescents and young adults with SCD. © Copyright 2020 Creative Health Care Management.",0
Emergence of the distinction between “verbal” and “musical” in early childhood development,"The pattern of acquisition of speech - and music-related skills during early stages of human infancy provides insight into the origins of language and music. Indiscriminate until shortly after birth, babies start gradually developing acoustic features in their vocalizations, as well as accompanying behaviors that make it possible to distinguish their attempts to speak from their attempts to sing. Comparative analysis of tonal organization of children’s original (nonimitative) vocalizations in their developmental succession throughout the first 3 years of life casts light on several important acoustic features. These features play an important role in the separation of music skills from verbal skills and shaping the primordial music system the infant uses to address his/her musical needs. Much of the existing scholarship makes a fundamental error by interpreting the earliest forms of human speech and music in terms of “adult” state of their mastery, regarding children’s communication as a sort of “defective” imitation of adults’ models. Moreover, such models are significantly biased toward Western classical music and Indo-European languages, which despite their cultural importance in the modern world, nevertheless, constitute only a small fraction of typology of tonal musical and phonological verbal organization. A much more comprehensive approach toward children’s music and speech has been developed by Lev Vygotsky and his circle: Alexander Luria, Aleksei Leontyev, Alexander Zaporozhets, Peter Galperin, as well as Boris Teplov. They and their followers regarded children’s speech and music as reflecting a child’s own peculiar method of thinking. The Vygotskian approach shares much in common with that of Piaget and the neo-Piagetians, but offers an alternative framework for the explanation of the dichotomy between language and music-based on the methodology of intonation theory by Boleslav Yavorsky and Boris Asafyev. This theory was implemented in the State program of obligatory education within all territories of the former USSR; it had passed deep scrutiny throughout many years of administration over a massive population, which resulted in the creation of a special discipline of ear development that theoretically and practically dealt with the development of “musical hearing” as distinguished from “verbal hearing” throughout childhood. Unfortunately, much of this literature is unknown to Western developmental specialists. This chapter covers this gap, familiarizing English-speaking scholars with a unique perspective on early musical and verbal development by Soviet and modern Russian ear-training specialists, with special attention to the issue of absolute pitch. Advances in the methodology of intonational analysis have made it possible to adequately describe and more deeply understand the principles that govern the tonal organization of non-Western types of music-including those that are based on timbre rather than pitch. This approach can be effectively applied to the analysis of both ethnological and developmental data-to identify common patterns of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",0
The storytellers: Oral retelling of bilingual children struggling to read in English,"This chapter analyzes the outcomes of our Proof of Concept. Specifically I focus on whether amount of talk, lexical density, and episodic structure improves when bilingual children, who are struggling to read in English, are given the opportunity to retell stories in English. 22 oral retellings by 8 Singaporean students (6-7 years old) in the Learning Support Program (LSP) in two schools were analyzed. The eight bilingual students were part of a study in which their home language was used as a scaffold to teach vocabulary and enhance comprehension in English. Each child presented oral retellings in English of stories based on four books taught in class. The books used were those in the curriculum of the schools. No attempt was made by the research team to change the books in the curriculum. The 22 oral narratives were qualitatively analyzed for amount of talk, vocabulary density, and episodic structure. The task had a within-subject design in that we measured the multiple stories told by each child for improvement in narrative skills. The extremely variable results, which could be because of the diversity in types of texts used in both schools, emphasize the importance of case-based approach in qualitatively coding the oral retelling of young learners. The chapter offers an in-depth analysis of the oral retellings of one student who benefited most from translanguaging pedagogy and produced excellent oral narratives. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",0
The preferences and needs of electronic dictionary among junior high students in Jakarta,"Dictionary is a plausible companion for language students. Dictionary is one of the powerful media that enhance not only students’ vocabulary mastery but also other aspects of language. Different characteristics of the user will define the different needs of the dictionary. This is a preliminary study, which provides insights into the dictionary preference and needs of Junior High School students in Jakarta. For this purpose, the researcher used a questionnaire and followed by a focus group discussion. There were a total of 98 students randomly chosen from the three grade classrooms participated in giving responses to a survey. Then, the researcher conducted a focus group discussion with five teachers to confirm the result of the questionnaire. The findings revealed that most students prefer to use a bilingual online dictionary than a monolingual and offline dictionary. Students use a dictionary when they are working on the English task, communicating with friends in English class, and listening to English songs. The result of the study also shows that students looked up the dictionary just when they wanted to search for the equivalent words of the target language and paying less attention to other information. The study recommends that EFL teachers should use a dictionary that is suitable for the needs of the students. The research also suggests that teachers should conduct training on dictionary use in the teaching and learning process to raise students’ awareness of extensive vocabulary input provided in the dictionary. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

ICT and aicle as facilitators in bilingual education,"The enormous development of information and communication technologies (ITC) and the expansion of the Internet have sparked a real revolution for the world of music, providing resources for music educators of all levels. Therefore, bilingual teaching is using new methodologies such as CLIL-AICLE, which finds in ICT an excellent resource to improve teaching practice, promoting the development of digital competence in students, as well as learning a foreign language. We justify the use of this educational blog: My Musical corner, http://mymusicalconer.blogspot.com/, which deals with the use and implementation of teaching and multimedia resources on Music in English. The main objective being to achieve a more effective communication of music in English enabling the formative and socializing dimension in our students. This work is conceived through a practical, cooperative and student-centered methodology, with an active, collaborative and communicative design suitable for comprehensive education. The results demonstrate that it can be an extraordinary learning tool in the educational context, as it offers an effective, attractive and easily accessible means to enrich the Secondary Education curriculum and the activities developed in the bilingual music classroom. © 2020 Universidad Jaume I de Castellon.

Web-Based Learning for Enhancing CSL Learners’ Language Proficiency in Singapore,"In language learning, the cognitive development of second language learners is often higher than their language level. How to bridge the gap between the two is a topic worthy of further discussion. This paper will demo how to use collaborative technologies such as collaborative post-it, mind mapping and co-writing. It takes Singaporean primary five students in learning Chinese as an example. When applying the aforementioned methods, this paper shows how to design a teaching sequence among the three collaborative tools. While implementation, this paper also shows how to interact among teacher-students and students-students. The scaffolding instruction strategies will be provided to meet the CSL learners’ need. This paper helps language teachers to design web-based learning effectively using collaborative technologies and tools to enhance CSL learners’ both cognitive level and language proficiency. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0
"Selection into, and academic benefits from, arts-related courses in middle school among low-income, ethnically diverse youth.","It is critical for research on the effects of arts engagement to identify and carefully control for preexisting selection factors that differentiate those who do and do not get exposure to the arts. We prospectively followed a large and diverse sample of preschool children (n = 31,332; 61% Latino, 32% Black, 55% ELL, 81% free/reduced lunch) until they completed 6th, 7th, and/or 8th grade. School readiness was assessed during pre-K, and archival public-school data were collected in middle school. Overall, 40% of students took some kind of arts elective course (music, dance, drama, visual art) during middle school. Black students, males, students with disabilities, those previously retained, and those not English proficient had reduced odds of taking an arts class. Children with stronger school readiness skills at age 4 and stronger academics in 5th grade were more likely to enroll in arts-related courses. Importantly, controlling for prior variables associated with selection into the arts, including prior academic performance, students with exposure to an arts elective in middle school subsequently had significantly higher GPAs and math and reading scores, and decreased odds of school suspension, compared to students not exposed to the arts.

Cultural threads in three primary schools: Introducing a critical cosmopolitan frame,"This paper explores headteachers' and teachers' perceptions of foreign languages( FL) and cultural learning in three primary schools in areas of disadvantage in England. Drawing upon a new theoretical frame for primary languages, Critical Cosmopolitanism (Delanty, 2006; Beck and Sznaider, 2006) and The Grammar of Culture (Holliday, 2018), we argue that the grand narrative of a target language inhabited by a target culture is outdated and approaches to cultural learning in primary schools could lead the way. There is substantial evidence that most learners find language lessons fun, particularly activities such as songs, stories and intercultural events (Driscoll et al., 2004, 2014; Cable et al. 2010). The discourse on conditions for inclusive practice is less commonplace and little is known about FL learning in areas of high deprivation (Nikolov & Mihaljević Djigunović, 2011). Teachers and headteachers in this study were committed to cultural learning and staff adopted creative approaches to teaching. The findings, however, also indicate that traditional notions of a mono or homogenised national culture with associated stereotypes linger in teachers' framing of FL. There exists a need for a more personalised approach to cultural learning drawing upon children's own cultural experiences.

Design and validation of a music technology course for initial music teacher education based on the tpack framework and the project-based learning approach,"This project outlines a design for, and presents an evaluation and validation of, an information and communication technology (ICT) training course on an initial teacher education programme for pre-service music teachers at a Spanish University. The primary objective was to improve initial teacher education in music technology through a course design with two key components: (1) ww constructivist learning through collaborative projects (PBL) and (2) the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) integration framework. The course saw students carry out four real-life projects, three of which involved the elabora-tion of educational material through the exclusive use of musical technology, and one of which involved an ICT research project. Results were obtained through an end-product evaluation and a self-assessment questionnaire and indicated that the course was well received and highly valued by the participants. In their self-assess-ment responses, students spoke of the academic value of the course, a confidence in their own skills, their willingness to use ICTs in future teaching contexts, the importance of ICTs in their degree programme, the fact that the course surpassed their expectations in terms of achievement (a fact corroborated through data trian-gulation in the end-product evaluation) and the transferability of the knowledge acquired to the music classroom. Finally, they provided suggestions for potential improvements to the course. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article. English language.",0
Technology-Based Tools for English Literacy Intervention: Examining Intervention Grain Size and Individual Differences,"Technology plays an increasingly important role in educational practice, including interventions for struggling learners (Torgesen et al., 2010; de Souza et al., 2018). This study focuses on the efficacy of tablet-based applications (see Word Reading, Grapholearn, and an experimental word-level program) for the purpose of supplementing early English literacy intervention with primary grades 1 and 2 children. The children were identified for learning support programs within Singaporean schools, which follow a bilingual policy, meaning children were learning reading in English plus an additional language. One hundred forty-seven children across seven schools participated (Mean age = 6.66). Within learning support classrooms, triplets of students matched on basic reading skills were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) phoneme-level, (2) rime-level, or (3) word-level focused interventions. All groups performed reading skills activities on iPads, across two phases over a 14-week period. Assessments for word reading accuracy and fluency, pseudoword decoding accuracy and fluency, and spelling were administered at four time points, pre- and post-intervention. Additional baseline measures were taken to assess individual differences in phonological awareness, orthographic awareness, general cognitive ability, statistical learning, and bilingual vocabulary knowledge. Mixed model analysis was conducted on the pre- to post-test measures across the two phases of the intervention (focused on accuracy then fluency). All groups made gains across the different literacy measures, while the phoneme-level intervention showed an advantage over the rime-level intervention, but not the word-level intervention, for decoding. There were also moderating effects of individual differences on outcomes. The general pattern of results showed an advantage of the word-level intervention for those with poorer phonological awareness for reading fluency; and a phoneme-level intervention advantage for those with poorer statistical learning ability. Children’s bilingual group (English plus Mandarin, English plus Malay, or English plus Tamil) also showed differential effects of the type of intervention (e.g., phoneme- or word-level) on different outcome measures. These results, along with data collected from the tablets during the intervention, suggest the need to examine the interplay between different types of technology-based interventions and individual differences in learning profiles. © Copyright © 2019 O’Brien, Habib and Onnis.",0
Visual programming environment scratch in the study of the school subject “fundamentals of life safety”,"The aim of the work was to study the effectiveness of the implementing technology of Scratch lessons in the study of the school subject ""Fundamentals of life safety"" in secondary school. The authors used a natural comparative pedagogical experiment. Pedagogical experiment included three stages: ascertaining stage – initial (before experiment) control of knowledge, abilities and skills of the trainees; forming stage – application of new training forms, methods or technologies; and controlling stage – evaluation of the effectiveness of new training forms, methods or technologies based on the final (after the experiment) control of acquired knowledge and skills. The experiment was conducted in 2018-2019 academic years (from September to April) according to the programs of the 5th to 9th grades of secondary school based on the municipal autonomous educational institution ""Secondary school No. 12"" of Syktyvkar, Komi Republic. The experiment involved 431 pupils from 15 grades. Among them, 217 pupils were included in an experimental group, in which the study of the life safety basics was carried out using Scratch environment, while 214 pupils were included in the control group, where the study of the same subject was carried out without the use of Scratch environment. To assess the effectiveness of the implementation of Scratch lessons, the authors have identified the following indicators: the number of terms and concepts learned; the correctness of actions and their order in various household and emergency situations; and correct assessment of the consequences of decisions taken in various domestic and emergency situations. The pedagogical experiment revealed greater involvement in the educational process, as well as greater interest in the taught material among pupils of the experimental group, who manifested the presence of basic programming skills, higher level of logical thinking compared to the control group. In the experimental group, a tendency in increasing teamwork among pupils on their own initiative was noted. This research can be applied in pedagogical studies on the influence of simple programming environments on personal, metasubject and subject-based results of training. The Scratch program in a secondary school in different countries of the world is most often used in the study of computer science, mathematics, physics, and foreign languages, and more rarely in the study of literature, geography, ecology, history, and music. The originality of the study consists in the use of Scratch program when studying the life safety basics. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved.",0
Influence of singing english songs on vocabulary learning by senior school students in Guangzhou,"Considering the values of English songs as well as the fact that only a few studies applied English songs to help students learn English words but none of them investigated the effect of singing English songs to learn English vocabulary in secondary schools, this study, presents to exploring how singing English songs would influence senior secondary schools students’ learning effectiveness and interest in English vocabulary in Guangzhou, a developed city in mainland China. The data were collected from fifty participants in Guangzhou. The qualitative methods consisted of four interviews and there were four experiments with two scenarios utilized respectively. Paired Sample T Test in SPSS was applied to analyze the data from the pre-tests and post-tests. The results demonstrated that singing English songs can be beneficial to senior high school students’ learning effectiveness and interest in learning English vocabulary. As for the implications: singing English songs can be one of the scenarios to be introduced in practical English teaching and a well-equipped English teacher with musical abilities or knowledge is needed. © 2019 by the authors.",1
Beyond music: Emotional skills and its development in young adults in choirs and bands,"Latest studies point out the importance of emotional competencies in young people’s education. Music is closely linked to people’s personal development and the evidence suggests that there are differences in young people who participate in group music-making activities and young people who do not. In the present study we analysed the socioemotional profile of sample of Spanish adolescent musicians who sang in choirs or played in bands. A total of 660 adolescent musicians and 655 non-musicians participated in the study, which evaluated emotional competencies, life satisfaction, motivation to study and capacity of leadership. At the same time, an ad hoc questionnaire was also administered to the musicians to obtain their academic musical profile. The results of the study show statistically significant differences between musicians and non-musicians in all measured variables, and suggest that, in line with previous research, belonging to a musical ensemble, such as choirs and bands, is related with the development of many skills as well as self-perception. Furthermore, it promotes the development of socioemotional competencies, motivation and leadership. © The Author(s) 2019.",0
Folktales and printed translations across the Indian subcontinent: The travelling tales of Niret Guru,"Folktales from across the Indian subcontinent have various interpretations about the structure of ""niti"" (conduct) reflected in them. The Sanskrit term niti is also a part of the regular vocabulary of almost all the languages of the Indian subcontinent, including Hindi, Sinhala, Nepali, Bengali, Tamil, and Assamese (amidst others), and can be translated as morality, correct behavioral conduct, or the rules of conduct. The notion of niti is reflected across many genres of folklore, including fables, rhymes, poems or chhara, songs, ballads, myths, and legends. It is mostly expressed through the primary emotions of jest, wit or humor, anxiety, apprehension and fear, hatred and jealousy, and sadness. A popular storyline in the region and across almost all forms of folklore is that of the ""foolish"" teacher and his small group of followers. The original stories are centered around a teacher-Gooroo Noodle from the folktales of South India-which was written and published by Italian missionary in Chennai in the mid-eighteenth century. Within a few decades, the popularity of the Tamil book encouraged several translations. It was first translated into English by Benjamin Babington (1915), and, soon after, this led to translations into other regional languages of the region. Thus, it became Niret Gurur Kahini (The Story of Niret Guru) in Bengali and Mahadaenamutta Sinhala Katandara (The Stories of Mahadana Muththa) in Sinhala. Thus, this particular erudite teacher came to be known through his many names across the Indian subcontinent. He is known as Mahadana Muththa in Sri Lanka; Guru Paramartan, Gooroo Noodle, and Guru Simpleton across Southern and Southeastern India; and Niret Guru in and around and beyond Bengal in Eastern India. Having their origin in the folklore of Southern India, the set of stories travelled across the region and moved south and reached the shores of Sri Lanka. The stories also travelled north and moved through southeastern parts of the Indian subcontinent toward Eastern and Northeastern India. This is a story of a simpleton-a foolish teacher-who sets out to find a few students as he feels he has too much of knowledge to share. Thus, he manages to find five ardent and devoted students. The rest of the stories revolve around the many lessons that the Guru teaches these five followers; until one day, because of the foolishness of the students, the Guru dies. Thus, this ends the stories of the Guru and his disciples. These texts helped to create a platform of interaction between the literature of the dialects and many other mother tongues and the printed word of the English language. On the other hand, the initial text in Tamil and the subsequent prints in other regional languages also helped to initiate an important era of translations from the English language. At present, most of these versions are out of print, though the main stories live on through various forms of digital media, including animation shorts. The stories of Gooroo Noodle, Niret Guru, or Mahadana Muththa are still popular across time and media and methods of communication. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020. All rights reserved.",0
The relationship between multilingual raters’ language background and their perceptions of accentedness and comprehensibility of second language speech,"The purpose of this case study is twofold: it (1) explores multilingual raters’ judgements regarding the accentedness and comprehensibility of second language speech and (2) examines how the raters’ language backgrounds influence their judgements. In this study, six multilingual Singaporean raters judged the accentedness and comprehensibility of 50 unfamiliar accented speech samples produced by Japanese learners of English with different proficiency levels. In order to investigate rater judgement, the rating scores were subjected to a multifaceted Rasch analysis. A questionnaire and an interview elicited the raters’ retrospective reports on their language backgrounds at three time points in their life (when they were 5, 11, and 21 years old). The results suggested that the raters’ language backgrounds, notably the proficiency balance between multiple languages in early childhood, are related to their rating judgement. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0
Coding as a playground: Promoting positive learning experiences in childhood classrooms,"In recent years, there has been a push to introduce coding and computational thinking in early childhood education, and robotics is an excellent tool to achieve this. However, the integration of these fundamental skills into formal and official curriculums is still a challenge and educators needs pedagogical perspectives to properly integrate robotics, coding and computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. Thus, this study evaluates a “coding as a playground” experience in keeping with the Positive Technological Development (PTD)framework with the KIBO robotics kit, specially designed for young children. The research was conducted with preschool children aged 3–5 years old (N = 172)from three Spanish early childhood centers with different socio-economic characteristics and teachers of 16 classes. Results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). Furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. The teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. Through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",0
The impact of using music and songs on teaching EFL in China by non-native english teachers,"Learning English is a process that most Chinese people undergo as a requirement for their primary to tertiary education. This paper investigates the impact of incorporating music as a tool for teaching EFL in China by a non-native English teacher. There are many reasons for using music as a tool for teaching English; however, this paper also illustrates the psychological and educational benefits associated with the use of music in an EFL classroom environment. During the process of teaching English, unforeseen difficulties may occur and an experienced teacher by incorporating music might be able to deal with these difficulties to a certain degree. Emphasis is put on music being used as a means to solve and deal with practical problems that can occur. The research questions are: What are the possible reasons for using music in the classroom? What are the benefits of using music in the classroom? What problems in regards to teaching students English can be solved with the help of music? The main findings of the study are that: The use of music in the classroom can accelerate the relationship of a new teacher with students. Music can help in cases such as disruptive behavior during a lesson, help students memorize new language patterns, facilitate the assimilation of English grammar by students, give students the opportunity to relax after mastering a complex topic without departing from the topic of the lesson and help students learn the usage of new words. This paper puts forward that with the aid of music, we can make the learning English process both more interesting and exciting for students. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.",0
Adolescent Coping Strategies in the Emergency Department,"Objectives The objective of this study was to describe coping mechanisms used by adolescents during emergency treatment. Methods A convenience sample of adolescent patients (aged 12-18 years) was surveyed in our large (87,000 annual visits) urban academic pediatric emergency department (ED) with an adapted Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences survey. Parents were surveyed about their perceptions of their child's coping mechanisms. Participants were excluded if they were non-English speaking, in police custody, had altered mental status, or were hemodynamically unstable. Results Of the 123 adolescents approached, 93 participated (response rate, 76%) and 80 completed the survey (completion rate, 86%). Sixty percent were female, and the mean (SD) age was 15 (2) years. Most respondents were non-Hispanic black (62%). Adolescents presented for acute complaints (48%); chronic worsening problems (33%); and injury from an accident or assault (19%). While in the ED, 62% felt safe, 56% reported boredom, and 94% felt supported by their parents. Adolescents reported that listening to music (82%), sleeping (76%), and focusing on getting better (75%) would minimize their stress in the ED. A total of 50 parents completed the survey. There was 79% agreement between parents and adolescents regarding adolescents listening to music to cope in the ED. There was 72% agreement between parents and adolescents in regard to parental support. Conclusions In this urban ED, parental involvement and listening to music were the most common coping strategies adolescents used during an ED visit. Attempts to improve patient-centered care should address opportunities for parental support and mechanisms for adolescents to listen to music. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",0
A rapid review of barriers to oral healthcare for vulnerable people,"Introduction People from vulnerable groups have higher levels of untreated dental disease compared to the general population, yet often experience barriers to accessing care. Difficulties accessing oral healthcare services have been suggested as one of the pathways that contribute to oral health inequalities. Aim To conduct a rapid review of current literature related to barriers to oral healthcare for people from vulnerable groups. Methods Electronic searching u sing MEDLINE via Ovid, covering articles from 2007 to 2017, and limited to the English language. Publication types included primary and secondary evidence from peer-reviewed journals and reports. Results From a total of 536 records, 308 full-text articles were included in the final review. Barriers were summarised at the individual, organisational and policy levels. Common barriers across all vulnerable groups included lack of affordability, difficulties accessing care, lack of availability of appropriate care, and lack of public funding for specialised services. In addition, specific barriers were identified for certain groups. Potential solutions included the provision of training and information to patients and carers about oral health and accessing dental services, training dental professionals in caring for vulnerable groups, and better use of skill mix and guidance to ensure publicly-funded dental services are commissioned to meet the needs of vulnerable groups. Conclusion This rapid review identified barriers to dental care for vulnerable groups at individual, organisational and policy levels to inform policymakers and commissioners. © 2019, British Dental Association.",0
The mastery of Arabic language communication with communicative active method,"Purpose of Study: Arabic language proficiency, especially speech is one of the main goals of learning Arabic in secondary schools or religious boarding schools in Indonesia. Active Communicative Method (KAK) is one method that can help students master the Arabic speech. This study aims to find out how is the implementation of the KAK at Pondok Pesantren Wali Songo. It also aims to look at the problems encountered in the implementation of the KAK, KAK effect in mastering Arabic speech and designing learning methods that can be used as an alternative in learning Arabic. Methodology: This study is a qualitative case study through interviews, observations and document analysis involving 12 respondents. Results: The findings showed that the implementation process KAK there are two, namely in the classroom and outside the classroom through a variety of activities such as the addition of vocabulary and sentence, question and answer, problem-solving, etc., and involve various stakeholders such as students, peers, muharrikah al-Lughah, teacher and principals. The weakness of Arabic grammar (Nahwu & Sharaf) is one of the problems faced by the students and they also forgot to speak the Arabic language. Shame and fear of making mistakes are also a problem in the implementation of KAK. The findings also indicate that the use of KAK had a positive impact on learning the Arabic language, especially speech, adding vocabulary, sentences, and improve understanding of the scriptures in Arabic. Implications/Applications: This researcher proposed a framework of Arabic KAK based learning that can be used as an alternative to diversify methods of learning foreign languages either in Indonesia or Malaysia. © Marpuah and Sulton.",0
"The ""Manic pixie dream girl of the synth-pop world"" and her ""Baby doll lisp"": Grimes and the disabling logics of the feminization and infantilization of lisping","Audible in speech and song, electro-pop singer Grimes’s so-called “baby doll” lisp generates endless buzz online, ranging from light-hearted adoration, to infantilization, to sexual fetish and even to ableist, misogynist anti-fandom. This article uses the reception of her lisp to build an intersectional theory of lisping across its medical and socio-cultural constructions, bridging work in disability studies, dysfluency studies, voice studies, and popular music studies in the process. I situate the slippage between adoring, infantilizing, fetishistic, and violent characterizations of Grimes’s lisp as reflective of the infantilization of “communicative disorders” in speech language pathology, and the dysfunction associated with feminine coded-speech patterns (e.g. vocal fry and up talk) in the popular imaginary. Lisping is profitably understood as an audible form of “liminal” difference relative to visible physical disabilities (St. Pierre), and to certain ableist, gendered, and racialized conceptions of normative vocality. Ultimately, in the English-speaking world, the lisp is symbolically-coded feminine while exceeding the norms of female vocality, thereby giving rise to a polarizing set of associations that work against female authority and, by extension in Grimes’s case, female musical authorship. Grimes’s reception thus offers a valuable case study for interrogating how misogynist fantasies regarding femininity are thought localized in the female voice, and the symbolic ties between disability and femininity. © 2019 by the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, U.S. Branch (IASPM-US).

Fostering gender competence through music videos in foreign language education,"Popular culture surrounds adolescents on a daily basis. Watching music videos (MVs) is one of the ways in which they encounter the English language. But it is not only that. By consuming artefacts from popular culture such as MVs, learners of English are presented with specific images and identities of individuals, which can have an influence on their perception of themselves and their role in society - both in terms of their sex and gender. This contribution provides an outline of the potential of MVs for developing gender competence. This includes a theoretical outline of the development of gender competence consisting of four core elements that need to be considered when designing lesson sequences based on MVs. After a review of previous analyses of MVs dealing with gender issues, a test for analysing gender discrimination in MVs is presented. This is followed by practical suggestions that aim to provide educators with useful tools for designing lesson sequences and activities that aim to foster a critical analysis of gender issues in MVs. The underlying argument is that learners need to be equipped with critical media literacy with regard to their perception of gender constructions so as to achieve confidence and develop openness and tolerance towards different gender identities in their adolescent and adult life. © Peter Lang AG 2019.",0
Lyrics from popular songs and rhyme to enhance the ESL Learner’s Proficiency in English Language,"The recent winning of the Nobel Prize for literature by Bob Dylan, a songwriter and lyricist inspired the writing of this article. It has always been a dormant idea in my mind to use lyrics to get children interested in learning the English Language. The acknowledgement of lyrics as a form of literature reinforced my conviction of the power of the written and spoken Word and its effect on its listeners. Being an experienced teacher of English language I have always adopted an eclectic approach to the teaching of Language; deciding on the most suitable technique and applying the most appropriate methodology to achieve learner’s specific objectives, learning style and context. English language learning is a process that fits the method to the learner not the learner to the method. We should as teachers of language opt for new trends that are more eclectic and humanistic in nature, which deals with emotions in the mind of the learner. We can use technology and the audio linguicism to capture the attention of the learner. The teaching of English and the imbibing of a language should be inherently and predominantly communicative. The most innate fact underlying the mastery of a language is to make learning it an enjoyable experience. Language cannot be taught but should be imbibed. We the teachers of English should be the facilitators helping children imbibe the English Language. The doorway to a new enriching experience, the window to the world through which the learner can explore and express his or her innate dreams and desires. The importance of the spoken word is something that I have always reiterated in all my classes of training and language learning. We must focus on the need to teach it in a more creative manner through lyrics of popular rhymes and songs that not only touch the mind but also every aspect of the life of prospective learners. It is an enjoyable and fun-filled method of imbibing the nuances of a Language. Without a doubt, it transforms the uninterested student to an eager participant in the activity of learning and imbibing and enriching himself and herself. I am a believer in the Power of the Word and its capacity to transform something mundane to lofty heights. That has been my mission statement from the beginning of my English teaching career that has spanned around twenty-five years of my life. © BEIESP.",0
Pitched battles: Music and sound in Anglo-American and German newsreels of world war II,"The observation by Siegfried Kracauer, one of the leading sociologists of the twentieth century, that the Nazisweremore skilled than the Americans and British in the use of cinematic devices in newsreels for war propaganda purposes was thought-provoking in its day. It still prompts critical engagement with the texts under consideration, even as recent scholarship has adopted a more nuanced position with regard to the Nazi use of persuasive media. A comparative study of Anglo-American and German newsreels produced during the Second WorldWar,with an emphasis on their use of music and sound, both questions and extends Kracauer’s hypotheses within the sonic realm. Music continues to serve the function of adding an affective voice to images in news media, which still count war reportage as one of their primary audiovisual vehicles for persuasive purposes. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
Changing memorisation to high order thinking skills (HOTS) in foreign language acquisition,"Memorisation has always been seen as a lower order thinking skill (LOTS). However, in foreign language acquisition, memorisation is inevitable. This paper attempts to present and discuss a Case Study on acquiring Arabic vocabulary through memorisation with the aim to rethink memorisation process as a higher order thinking skill (HOTS). The study involved four purposively chosen Arabic language elementary school teachers. Two research questions were addressed: i) How is memorisation employed, and ii) Why is memorisation applied in foreign language acquisition? Data was gathered through in-depth interviews and triangulated with observations and document analysis. Findings show that the Arabic language teachers applied vocabulary memorisation as HOTS through the use of i) repetition, ii) flashcards, iii) ICT, iv) imagination, and v) nasheed (singing in Arabic language). While the rationale illuminated were for: i) long-term memory, ii) foundation to other cognitive verbs, and iii) interactive learning. It can therefore be concluded that memorisation has a higher level in the education hierarchy. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",0
"EFL learners’ speaking proficiency and its connection to emotional understanding, willingness to communicate and musical experience","One of the main reasons for studying a foreign language is communicating with others, but many students do not feel confidently enough when trying to develop their speaking skills. Among adolescents’ frequent activities are that of listening to music while paying attention to song lyrics. We hypothesize that these musical experiences could influence their speaking skills. The present study aims to consider different factors that could influence students’ speaking proficiency. Among these factors, students’ emotional understanding, their willingness to communicate in a FL and their musical experience are considered. One hundred and twenty-four students of English as a foreign language (EFL) in the fourth year of Secondary Education from three different high schools in Spain took part in the study. Oral data were collected through individual interviews and three scales were administered to measure the different factors. Students’ musical experience and emotional response to music were measured through The Absorption in Music Scale, their emotional understanding of verbal texts through The Situational Test of Emotional Understanding – Brief, and their willingness to communicate in the EFL class through Willingness to Communicate Scale. Although no direct connection was found between students’ musical experience and their speaking proficiency, results demonstrate that students with high emotional understanding show better speaking skills and that students with musical experience exhibited higher emotional understanding. We detected a significant positive connection between emotional understanding and all the five parameters considered to assess students’ speaking proficiency. The connection between willingness to communicate in the EFL class and students’ speaking skills is even greater. © The Author(s) 2019.",0
Music education in general education secondary schools in ostrava from the 1890s to 1945,"The study deals with the formation of music education in general education schools in Ostrava in the period from the 1890s to 1945. Music education was carried out within the framework of non-compulsory singing (it was only from 1943 that musical education was included among compulsory subjects), where it was mostly taught by so-called external pedagogues. The study gives a vivid picture of music education in four key general education secondary schools – at the matriculation gymnasium in Moravská Ostrava, Czechoslovak state grammar school in Moravská Ostrava, Municipal Grammar School in Přívoz and the Girls‘Lyceum / Girls‘Reform Grammar School in Slezská Ostrava. The Orchestra of Secondary School Students (Orchester deutscher Studenten der Ostrauer Mittelschulen), which was highly significant also for Czech students, had a special place in the context of contemporary music education activities among the Germans in Ostrava. © 2019 Masaryk University.

Entretien avec Jonathan Glover: Retour sur Questions de vie ou de mort,"A few months after the publication of the French translation of his book Causing Death and Saving Lives (in French Questions de vie ou de mort, Labor et fides, 2017), Jonathan Glover was kind enough to return to some of the theses defended in this book. In forty years, this work has become a classic of applied ethics in the English-speaking world. Glover tackled a series of questions involving the lives of men and women, including abortion, infanticide, suicide, euthanasia, the death penalty and war. We asked him here about the method he considers the best in moral philosophy, and returned to his criticism of certain dominant ideas at the time (doctrine of sacred life, the distinction between acts and omissions, the principle of double effect, etc.). Jonathan Glover also discusses some of the positions of his former students Peter Singer and Jeff McMahan. © 2019 University of Montreal. All rights reserved.",0
Are temporal and tonal musical skills related to phonological awareness and literacy skills? - Evidence from two cross-sectional studies with children from different age groups,"Temporal and spectral auditory processing abilities are required for efficient and unimpaired processing of speech and might thus be associated with the development of phonological and literacy skills in children. Indeed, studies with unselected children have found links between these basic auditory processing abilities and the development of phonological awareness, reading, and spelling. Additionally, associations between the processing of temporal or spectral/tonal information in music and phonological awareness/literacy have been reported, but findings concerning relations between music processing and spelling are rather sparse. To gain more insights into the specific, potentially age-dependent relevance of various temporal (e.g., rhythm, tempo) and tonal (e.g., pitch, melody) musical subdomains for phonological awareness and literacy, we adapted five music-processing tasks (three temporal, two tonal) for use with tablet computers and used them in two cross-sectional studies with German children from two age groups: Study 1 was conducted with preschool children (about 5 years of age; without formal reading and spelling instruction) and focused on associations between music processing and phonological awareness. In Study 2, third-graders (about 8 years of age) were investigated concerning relations between music processing, phonological awareness, reading comprehension, and spelling. In both studies, rhythm reproduction and pitch perception turned out to be significant predictors of phonological awareness in stepwise regression analyses. Although various associations between music processing and literacy were found for third-graders in Study 2, after phonological awareness was accounted for, only rhythm reproduction made a unique contribution to literacy skills, namely, to alphabetic spelling skills. Hence, both studies indicate that temporal (i.e., rhythm reproduction) and spectral/tonal (i.e., pitch perception) musical skills are distinctly and uniquely related to phonological awareness in children from different age groups (preschool vs. Grade 3). The finding that rhythm reproduction, an auditory temporal processing skill integrating perceptual and motor aspects of rhythm processing, was especially tightly linked to phonological awareness and literacy corroborates other findings on associations between rhythm processing and literacy development and is of interest from the viewpoint of current theories of developmental dyslexia. The potential relevance of our results for applied research concerning early diagnosis and training of literacy-related skills is discussed. © 2019 Steinbrink, Knigge, Mannhaupt, Sallat and Werkle.",0
"Games, rhymes, and wordplay of London children","This book presents a unique annotated collection of some 2000 playground games, rhymes, and wordplay of London children. It charts continuity and development in childlore at a time of major social and cultural change and offers a detailed snapshot of changes in the traditions and language of young people. Topics include: starting a game; counting-out rhymes; games (without songs); singing and chanting games; clapping, skipping, and ball bouncing games; school rhymes and parodies; teasing and taunting; traditional belief and practice; traditional wordplay; and a concluding miscellany. Recorded mainly in the 1980s by primary schoolteacher Nigel Kelsey, transcribed verbatim from the children’s own words, and accompanied by extensive commentaries and annotation, the book sets a wealth of new information in the wider historical and contemporary context of existing studies in Britain, Ireland, and other parts of the English-speaking world. This valuable new resource will open new avenues for research and be of particular interest to folklorists and linguists, as well as to those working across the full spectrum of social, cultural, and educational studies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019.",0
'There Must Be Something There That We Don't Know About': Massenet and Lucy Arbell,"Lucy Arbell (1878-1947) assumed an important position in Massenet's compositional process and output. Beginning with Ariane in 1906, he wrote principal or secondary roles for the singer in all of his operas, as well as the celebrated song cycle Expressions lyriques (1909-1911). Despite Massenet's admiration, the French contralto was received ambivalently by critics and she fell into oblivion soon after his death. For some, her talents as an actress could not make up for the mediocre quality of her voice. Drawing on unpublished and hitherto unknown archival documents, this article explores Arbell's career, which has been largely overlooked by scholars. I reveal how her career's evolution was intimately connected to the professional and sentimental relationship between singer and composer. Massenet notably wrote roles for her that included extensive use of spoken declamation, which sets them apart in the history of opera. Copyright © 2019 Cambridge University Press.",0
Children with high potential and difficulties: Contributions of clinical research,"We have been sensitized to children with high intellectual potential (HIP) having difficulties given the number of children consulting in our outpatient medico-psychological centres for scholastic problems (possibly leading to school failure), anxiety disorders or behavioral disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and in which a high intellectual potential was discovered during psychological assessments. It is the contrast, and more precisely the paradox, between the high intellectual potential of these children and their scholastic difficulties (including school failure), and the psychic suffering expressed by some of them, which led us to question, challenge and propose therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children. It is in this context that we created in December 2005 the CNAHP (National Center for Assistance to High Potential children and adolescents) which is a public centre integrated into the hospital-university department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rennes. It is noteworthy that not all children with HIP have difficulties, and children with school failure or behavioral problems are not always children with HIP. However, it is necessary not to minimize the problem raised by children with HIP with difficulties by ignoring its frequency or by considering that these children are “intelligent” enough to manage by themselves and do not need to be helped, whereas some of them can show school failure and even be de-scholarized. Indeed, based on the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) of an intellectual Quotient (IQ) above 130 (level corresponding to a statistical threshold), the frequency of children with HIP represents 2.3% of the population of schoolchildren aged 6 to 16. The frequency is therefore not so rare. However, it remains to be determined by French epidemiological studies what is the actual frequency of children with difficulties within a population of children with HIP. The analysis of the CNAHP research data from a clinical population (children with HIP consulting for difficulties) highlights that children with HIP can show major school problems (including school failure, defined here as having or foreseeing repetition of a grade), which corresponds to 7.5% of 611 children with HIP consulting at the CNAHP) and socioemotional problems (emotional regulation disorders) in relation to their high intellectual potential. In particular, anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric disorders observed in this population (40.5%) and were significantly associated with high verbal potential. This significant association requires further studies to avoid establishing a simplistic unidirectional and reductive linear cause-effect relationships. Indeed, a high verbal potential can elicit and/or reinforce anxiety-producing representations, but anxiety disorders may also lead to a defensive over investment of verbal language. The results are discussed in this article and suggest that scholastic and/or psychological difficulties encountered by some children with HIP can be related to their high intellectual potential. It is necessary to develop therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children from a better understanding, based on research results, of their possible difficulties but also cognitive abilities. Even when children with HIP have scholastic and/or psychological difficulties, some of their cognitive skills can be preserved contrary to appearances, with for example, as seen in the CNAHP results, excellent attentional capacities shown by cognitive tests contrasting with behavioral attention deficit reported by parents. These skills are important to identify as they are resources which support the therapeutic and educational project. It is probably through an articulation among professionals from national education, health and research, in alliance with the family (parents, child, and siblings), that advances will be made. In the same way that professionals have been interested in children with intellectual disabilities, it is important to be concerned by children with HIP and difficulties located at the other end of the continuum. It is a question of ethics which concerns both caregivers and teachers. It is also a societal issue that concerns all of us given that the expression of high intellectual and creative potential in children may be essential to the societal development of innovative strategies and each nation's future. Finally, the discussion can be extended to all children, independent of their potential. What we learn from children with HIP and difficulties can be applied to each child: it is important at family, school and societal levels to facilitate the expression of the potential of children, to value their skills, and to help them to remove possible inhibitions of their potential based on individualized projects. The acceptance of singularity and differences in children can contribute to tolerance and the development of creativity, in the interest of the subject and of society. © 2018 L'Encéphale, Paris",0
“I'll Show You How to Write My Name”: The Contribution of Naturalistic Sibling Teaching to the Home Literacy Environment,"Research on the home literacy environment has typically involved parents as teachers with little attention given to siblings’ roles in teaching each other. This study examines naturalistic language and literacy teaching by 39 sibling dyads, at two timepoints, when children were ages 2 and 4 (time 1; T1) and again at ages 4 and 6 (time 2; T2). Each family was observed for a total of six 90-minute sessions at both timepoints. First, all sibling-directed teaching sequences were identified, including instances of formal and informal teaching. Second, sequences were coded for evidence of language (i.e., vocabulary, book concepts, songs, phonological awareness) and literacy concepts (i.e., alphabetic principle, reading, writing, spelling). Over 40% of the T1 and T2 teaching sequences involved language and literacy concepts. Older siblings taught the majority of the time at T1 and T2; however, the number of sequences taught by younger siblings increased proportionally over time. Because siblings taught vocabulary concepts significantly most often at both T1 and T2, further analyses were conducted on vocabulary subcategories (i.e., expansion, discussing pictures, relaying word meaning, checking for listener understanding, second-language instruction). Significantly more teaching sequences involved expansion than other vocabulary subcategories at both timepoints. Finally, at T2, literacy concepts (i.e., writing, spelling) were taught significantly more than at T1. Our findings demonstrate that siblings are interested in teaching each other a variety of language and literacy concepts during naturalistic interactions in the home, indicating that siblings contribute to the richness of the home literacy environment. © 2017 International Literacy Association",0
"Silent reading fluency, musical aptitude and foreign language","Reading, and particularly silent reading, is a constant activity in our daily life and a basic tool for accessing knowledge. In the past two decades, there has been a proliferation of studies around the connections between music and reading skills, but most of these studies deal with native language and infants. The main objective of this article is to review the most relevant contributions that could establish a link between silent reading fluency and musical aptitude of adult learners of a foreign language. Lack of prosodic sensitivity involves deficiencies in accessing and comprehending a written text. Rhythmic and melodic features shared by both music and language become predictors of the reading process development, allowing musical interventions to have an influence and enhance learning, or becoming indicators of pre-existing individual differences. After having reviewed the existing literature, we conclude that, in order to determine the existence of a significative influence of musical aptitude in silent reading fluency of adult learners of a foreign language, more studies are needed collecting data of adults native and foreign language silent reading fluency, along with their musical aptitude, cognitive abilities and socio-economical context. © 2018 Tejuelo.

A tablet game to target dyslexia screening in pre-readers,"Using serious games to screen dyslexia has been a successful approach for English, German and Spanish. In a pilot study with a desktop game, we addressed pre-readers screening, that is, younger children who have not acquired reading or writing skills. Based on our results, we have redesigned the game content and new interactions with visual and musical cues. Hence, here we present a tablet game, DGames, which has the potential to predict dyslexia in pre-readers. This could contribute to around 10% of the population that is affected by dyslexia, as children will gain more time to learn to cope with the challenges of learning how to read and write. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",0
Children benefit from morphological relatedness independently of orthographic relatedness when they learn to spell new words,"We examined whether French children in Grades 3 and 5 (aged ∼ 8–11 years) benefit from morphological relatedness beyond orthographic relatedness in the implicit learning of new spellings. Children silently read stories that included two target nonwords. One nonword was in an opaque condition in that nothing in the story could justify the spelling of its final sound. The other nonword was in either a morphological condition (for children in the morphological group) or an orthographic condition (for children in the orthographic group). In the morphological condition, the final spelling of the target nonword was justified by two morphologically related nonwords. For example, coirardage, obtained by adding the suffix age to coirard, designates the coirard's song and justifies the final silent d of coirard. The orthographic condition included two nonwords that were orthographically but not morphologically related to the target. For example, the coirard's song was coirardume, obtained by adding ume, which is not a suffix, to coirard. Then, 30 min after reading the stories, children were asked to choose the correct spelling of each nonword from among three phonologically plausible alternatives (e.g., coirard, coirars, coirar). In the morphological group, both third and fifth graders more often selected the correct spellings for items presented in the morphological condition than for items presented in the opaque condition. In the orthographic group, the results were very similar in the opaque and orthographic conditions. The findings show that the benefit of morphological relatedness in the implicit learning of new spellings cannot be reduced to orthographic relatedness. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",0
Development of linguistic abilities in bilingual education through musical stories,"Bilingual education at the earlier stages of education is one of the main concerns of current governments and educative policies. This is resulting in the proliferation of new methodologies and educative proposals in order to obtain the best possible results. However, most of the time, teachers and educators focus on teaching linguistic elements in isolation. The aim of this chapter is to propose the use of musical tales in bilingual education in early childhood education as a tool for teachers and students to learn to communicate fluently in the foreign language. The use of music, literature, and drama in the same activity makes the perfect combination to help children learn a new language, since it improves aspects like vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and the communicative compentence in general. © 2018, IGI Global.

Towards language independent detection of dyslexia with a web-based game,"Detecting dyslexia is important because early intervention is nnkey to avoid the negative effects of dyslexia such as school failure. Most of the current approaches to detect dyslexia require expensive personnel (i.e. psychologists) or special hardware (i.e. eye trackers or MRI machines). Also, most of the methods can only be used when children are learning how to read but not before, necessarily delaying needed early intervention. In this work, we present a study with 178 participants speaking different languages (Spanish, German, English, and Catalan) with and without dyslexia using a web-based game built with musical and visual elements that are language independent. The study reveals eighth game measures with significant differences for Spanish children with and without dyslexia, which could be used in future work as a basis for language independent detection. A web-based application like this could have a major impact on children all over the world by easily screening them and suggest the help they need. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Using music technology to motivate foreign language learning,"Music is a fun and engaging form of entertainment and is often used by teachers to help students learn languages. In this paper, we describe how recent advances in music technology can be used to develop language learning applications that might help children, young adults, and adult learners grow their vocabularies, improve their pronunciation, and increase their cultural appreciation. We describe two apps that are under development: A karaoke app and a personalized radio app. Our goal is to provide teachers and students with new tools that are engaging, promote joyful learning, improve foreign language learning and mother tongue retention. © 2017 IEEE.",0
Adults recognize toddlers’ song renditions,"The present study explored the singing ability of toddlers 16 months to 3 years of age by examining North American adults’ ability to identify toddlers’ renditions of familiar tunes sung with foreign lyrics. After listening to each toddler’s song, half with familiar melodies and half with unfamiliar melodies, adults attempted to name the songs. Their identification was highly accurate, refuting the prevailing view that toddlers focus on words at the expense of tunes. The singing range of these non-English-speaking toddlers and that of their English-speaking counterparts approximated the pitch range of the target songs, which is inconsistent with the reportedly small singing range of toddlers. Toddlers’ apparent singing proficiency in the present context may stem from the use of home-based recordings and child-selected songs. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0
Teaching English to Young Learners Through Indonesian - Translated Songs,"As an international language, English is taught and learnt by almost all of the people in the world. In Indonesia for example, English has been introduced since the learners are studying at the elementary school. Even many of the Kindergarten Schools too, have already introduced this language to their students. However, we cannot deny that teaching foreign language is not such an easy thing due to the fact thatmany of the learners are not capable of speaking English very well although they have been learning it for more than ten years (Elementary: 6 years, Junior and Senior High School: 6 years). In line with this problem, this study aims at providing a solution by offering one teaching technique which seems to make the learners (especially young learners) enjoy learning through singing songs (Kasihani, 1999).Furthermore, Phillips(1995) said that young learners really enjoyed learning and singing songs with highly motivating. Based on those two researches andin efforts to make it easier in English language learning, especially to young learners, the writer translated the very common and popular Indonesian kid songs into English. Thesetranslated songswere then used to teach the students of Kindergarten up to Elementary ones of the first and second grade. This meant that before a teacher started to teach, s/he had to translate the Indonesian kid songsat first into English.Due to its popularity and familiarity, it was expected that this teaching technique would be more effective and efficient to apply especially to young learners. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",0
Teaching strategies of selected Filipino EFL teachers and its perceived effects to Thai students,"In Second Language Learning Acquisition (SLA) motivating strategies are important to increase the interest of the students, particularly in countries where English is not widely spoken or read. Thus, foreign teachers in English speaking countries are encouraged to work in countries such as Thailand, Japan, Korea and Saudi Arabia to mention some. In 2015 there were a total of 17,921 Filipino migrants. Most job networking sites like Ajarn.com, preferred Filipinos because they speak better English, and received much lower salaries compared to the so-called Native English Speakers. Filipino teachers in Thailand do not just teach English, they also teach Mathematics, Science and Social Studies. Some who are inclined to arts are also teaching elementary levels. Filipino teachers are in prestigious universities and in the deepest villages in Thailand. Despite cultural differences, the Filipinos are able to adapt well in the country. The four learning areas in EFL are the following: listening, speaking, writing and reading. As an EFL teacher, what are the problems you encountered in the identified areas of learning? What are the strategies employed by the Filipino teachers in these areas? What are the perceived effects of the strategies to the students? The aim of this study is to determine the Filipino teachers' strategies in overcoming the difficulties in teaching English and its perceived effects to the students. The study used quantitative and qualitative data to analyze the methods of the Filipino teachers in teaching English and other subjects to their students in all levels. The author used Google forms in collecting data for easier tabulation and interpretations of the study. The researchers also interviewed personally selected respondents for further clarifications of their strategies. The result of the study shows that the strategies commonly used by Filipino EFL teachers are playing English songs for listening, oral spelling for speaking, written spelling for writing, and silent reading. English songs, singing and Pictionary are also identified as effective methods in teaching EFL. © 2018 Asian E F L Journal Press. All Rights Reserved.",0
Correlation between musical aptitude and learning foreign languages: An epidemiological study in secondary school Italian students,"The aim of this study was to assess if a correlation exists between language learning skills and musical aptitude through the analysis of scholarly outcomes concerning the study of foreign languages and music. We enrolled 502 students from a secondary Italian school (10-14 years old), attending both traditional courses (2 hours/week of music classes scheduled) and special courses (six hours). For statistical analysis, we considered grades in English, French and Music. Our results showed a significant correlation between grades in the two foreign languages and in music, both in the traditional courses and in special courses, and better results in French than for special courses. These results are discussed and interpreted through the literature about neuroanatomical and physiological mechanisms of foreign language learning and music perception. © 2018, Pacini Editore S.p.A..

"Benefits of Measures to Promote Development in Language, Mathematics and Singing in Kindergardeners: Analysis of Data Collected at School Entrance Examination in the County of Biberach","Objectives To evaluate the benefits of implementing measures to promote skills in the areas of language, mathematics and singing in kindergardeners by statistical analysis of data collected during the school entrance examination (ESU) of 4-5-year-old children from the county of Biberach. Methods Study 1 employs multivariate regression analysis to analyse - in chronological order - the ESU data on 4 cohorts (2011-2014; n=7 148) of children of the Biberach county. Study 2 qualitatively compares identical data representative of the entire state of Baden-Württemberg (N=3×80 000) with the Biberach results. Study 3 focuses on the cohort 2014 in Biberach county (n=1 783) and employs logistical regression techniques to correlate curriculum content and child development. Results There are significant performance improvements in the Biberach population (2011-2014) in the development of language and early mathematics, as well as in visual comprehension and visuomotor skills, but not in the area of gross motor skills. Similar improvements are much more difficult to demonstrate for the entire state of Baden-Württemberg. The detailed analysis of the 2014 Biberach County data reveal that kindergardeners with increased exposure to mathematics will have a decreased risk of failure in early mathematics (OR 0.72) and grammar skills (OR 0.53-0.75). Children with speech impairment or children not fluent in German that had extra language tutorials, typically in small groups and 4 times a week for 30 min, still have a higher risk of failure in all developmental aspects, save gross motor skills (e. g. OR 3.32 in grammar skills, OR 3.08 for hyperactivity). Programs with emphasis on singing have little effect on the above data. The risk of failure in German language is high (OR 2.78) for those of non-German backgrounds, but less in visuomotor skills (OR 0.52) and hyperactivity (OR 0.51). Conclusions Statistical analyses show positive correlation of curriculum content and early child development for the kindergardens in Biberach county. The gains in performance are consistent with those reported from kindergardens known for pedagogical excellence. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",0
No. 355-Physiologic Basis of Pain in Labour and Delivery: An Evidence-Based Approach to its Management,"Objective: To review the evidence relating to nonpharmacological approaches in the management of pain during labour and delivery. To formulate recommendations for the usage of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management. Options: Nonpharmacological methods available for pain management during labour and delivery exist. These should be included in the counselling and care of women. Evidence: PubMed and Medline were searched for articles in French and English on subjects related to “breastfeeding,” “pain,” “epidural,” “anaesthesia,” “analgesia,” “labour,” “labor,” and combined with “gate control theory,” “alternative therapies,” “massage,” “position,” “mobility,” “TENS,” “bathing,” “DNIC,” “acupuncture,” “acupressure,” “sterile water injection,” “higher center,” “control mind,” “cognitive structuring,” “holistic health,” “complementary therapy(ies),” “breathing,” “relaxation,” “mental imagery,” “visualization,” “mind focusing,” “hypnosis,” “auto-hypnosis,” “sophrology,” “mind and body interventions,” “music,” “odors,” “biofeedback,” “Lamaze,” “Bonapace,” “prenatal training,” “gymnastic,” “chanting,” “haptonomy,” “environment,” “transcutaneous electrical stimulus-stimulation,” “antenatal education,” “support,” “continuous support,” “psychosocial support,” “psychosomatic medicine,” “supportive care,” “companion,” “intrapartum care,” “nurse,” “midwife(ves),” “father,” “doula,” “caregiver,” “ hormones,” “oxytocin,” “endorphin,” “prolactin,” “catecholamine,” “adrenaline,” and “noradrenaline” from 1990 to December 2015. Additional studies were identified by screening reference lists from selected studies and from expert suggestions. No language restrictions were applied. Validation methods: The quality of the evidence is rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice are ranked according to the method described in this report. Benefits, risks, and cost: The nonpharmacological method encourages an incremental approach to pain management that contributes to reduced interventions through optimal use of the woman's neurophysiologic and endocrine resources and a better understanding of the physiology of stress and pain during labour. Guideline update: The guideline will be reviewed 5 years after publication to decide whether all of part of the guideline should be updated. However, if important new evidence is published prior to the 5-year cycles, the review process may be accelerated for a more rapid update of some recommendations. Sponsors: This guideline was developed with resources funded by The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Summary Statements: 1. It is important that all health care professionals have a good understanding of pain in childbirth including its physiological and psychological management whether or not a person in labour also chooses pharmacological relief (III).2. A growing body of scientific literature supports the use of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management during childbirth due to their numerous benefits for the mother and child, including a reduction in the need for obstetrical interventions, labour augmentation, or Caesarean section (l).3. Suffering, as opposed to pain, occurs when a woman is unable to activate her own mechanisms for coping with pain, or when her own mechanisms are insufficient to deal with the situation (III).4. The Gate Control Theory mechanism, which consists of creating pleasant stimulations in the painful area between or during contractions is best achieved through ambulation, gentle massage, stroking, water, or vibrations (I).5. The Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (which consists of applying painful stimulations at any site on the body for the duration of each painful contraction) is best achieved through acupressure, sterile water injections, or deep massage (I).6. The Central Nervous System Control mechanism, which consists of deviating or focussing the woman's attention is best activated through labour support and the practice of yoga, relaxation, visualization, breathing, auto-hypnosis and cognitive restructuring (I).7. Continuous labour support, as part of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management during childbirth, reduces stress, fear, and anxiety, which in turn decreases the frequency of obstetrical interventions (I).8. Natural oxytocin is not only important for uterine contractions; it enhances a sense of calmness and reduces pain. Because synthetic oxytocin does not cross the blood-brain barrier in a significant manner, the analgesic and psychological effects on the mother of calmness and well-being are lost (II).9. Elevated endorphins in labour help reduce maternal stress and pain and may assist in newborn adaptations (II).10. Health care providers and the birthing environment can have a major impact on labour progress and experience by paying attention to and reducing a woman's stress level (I).11. Prolactin not only promotes breast milk production, it optimizes the mother's physiologic and behavioural responses in adapting to her role (II).12. Creating a calm, stress-free environment, encouraging women, and having a positive attitude where possible play an important role to stimulate the endogenous hormone production that promotes and supports the physiologic progress of labour (II).13. Neurophysiologic and hormonal mechanisms contribute to help women cope with the intensity of labour (l).Recommendations: 1. Health care providers should be familiar with the neurophysiological and hormonal mechanisms and related methods in physiological labour and birth (III-A).2. To help women cope with normal labour, nonpharmacological approaches are recommended as a safe first-line method for pain relief and should be continued throughout labour whether or not pharmacologic methods are used (I-A).3. To prevent suffering, health professionals should address the emotional component of pain (pain unpleasantness). This is most effectively achieved through support and nonpharmacological approaches to pain management.4. To develop support measures consistent with the wishes of women, health professionals should work with women and listen to their needs (III-A).5. To further reduce the need for obstetric interventions and avoid associated risks and side-effects, health professionals should provide continuous labour support with the addition of at least one other nonpharmacological pain modulating mechanism (I-A).6. Health professionals should, where possible, promote and support the physiological progress of labour, delivery, and the postpartum period trusting the woman's ability to work with her pain and encouraging her to rely on her ability to give birth (III-A).7. To enhance the endogenous hormone production that promotes and supports the physiologic process of labour, health care providers should reduce a woman's stress level by encouraging her and having a positive attitude where possible and by creating a calm, stress-free environment (I-A).8. Continuous labour support, as part of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management during childbirth for women should be promoted and provided for all women in labour (I-A).9. Health professionals should encourage parents and the people assisting them to prepare for the birth by learning about birth physiology and gaining skills in working with pain (III-A). © 2018 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada",0
"The pragmatic alliance of DEFA and Barrandov: Cultural transfer, popular cinema and Czechoslovak-east German co-productions, 1957-85","This article examines the cooperation that took place between the East German DEFA and Czechoslovakia’s Barrandov film studios, in terms of their coproductions and the recruitment of Czechoslovak talent to work on nominally East German productions. By analysing these ventures from their inception in 1957 onwards, I consider the conditions supervising the transfer of professional skills between the studios, especially during periods of intensive exchange: the mid- 1960s and the 1970s. I argue that DEFA utilized Barrandov-contracted talent to facilitate its production of commercially viable light entertainment. In the 1960s, ‘travelling filmmakers’ helped DEFA to launch a series of East Germanproduced musicals and Indianerfilme. In the 1970s, DEFA functionaries aimed to benefit from the creative input Czechoslovak scriptwriters, directors and producers brought to children’s films. I suggest the two periods in question were shaped by distinct sets of institutional, political and creative circumstances. The recruitment of individual Czechoslovak personnel in the earlier period enabled DEFA to train in-house talent. A decade later, purges enacted by the Czechoslovak Communist Party limited creative possibilities for this country’s film-makers, incentivizing a newfound desire to partner with a studio that Barrandov had previously deemed beneath it. © 2017 IAMHIST & Informa UK Limited.",0
Energizing students’ reading comprehension through multimodal texts,"Teaching and learning process is an essential aspect of a successful English teaching and learning. Reading skill is one of the language skills in English which gives a huge input to the learner. Nevertheless, it is mostly found that reading material and its exercises examine explicitly of what have been learned. Recently, multimodal texts become more popular in educational aspect especially the use of multimodal text in the teaching and learning reading. Multimodal text is a text that contains semiotic mode which covers gesture, visual image, document, layout, music, architectural design, etc. This study interviewed 10 Junior High School students and 1 English teacher regarding the use of multimodal text in reading class. The design of the study was a qualitative descriptive study which investigates the use of multimodal texts in teaching learning process in Indonesia compare to other countries. This study is expected to have a deeper insight and significant contribution for the English pedagogy. © 2018, Universitas Negeri Makassar- Faculty of Languages and Literature.

English Exposure and Vocabulary Proficiency at the Onset of English Instruction,"This chapter reports findings of a study that explores 4th grade students’ attitudes towards English and examines which contributing factors influence their motivation for learning English, specifically English vocabulary. The study then maps out students’ actual English vocabulary proficiency at the mandated onset of formal instruction, and after one to four years of formal instruction. The study is part of the author’s PhD study of over 400 4th graders in different compulsory schools throughout Iceland. Data was collected through surveys, interviews and receptive and productive vocabulary tests. Tests showed themselves to have internal and external validity and reliability. Results support previous assumptions of the extensive English proficiency of young learners, which exceeds curriculum goals for the 4th grade. However, onset of English instruction was not a strong factor in accounting for the learners’ lexical proficiency. The results show a strong relationship between proficiency and personal needs to use English to understand television programs and music lyrics, while using computers and speaking to foreigners. Further, these results suggest a disconnect between official curriculum goals and guidelines, including what is the most appropriate age to begin formal instruction and from the linguistic reality in which these children find themselves. Young children do not seem to equate English as a school subject with the English they use outside of school. The findings are that children’s language proficiency is acquired largely extramurally and motivated by a need to use English in their daily lives rather than within the school setting. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",0
Introduction,"Creativity lies at the heart of major shifts in the understanding of human culture and the human imaginative capacity. For Philip Sidney, writing during the English Renaissance, ‘[t]here is no art’ – in which category, it is important to note, he includes astronomy, geometry, mathematics, music, philosophy, law, grammar and medicine – ‘delivered unto mankind that has not the works of Nature for his principal object, without which they could not consist, and on which they so depend, as they become actors and players, as it were, of what Nature will have set forth’ (Sidney 2002, pp. 84–5); but he adds, crucially, that ‘Nature never set forth the earth in so rich tapestry as divers poets have done […]. Her world is brazen, the poets only deliver a golden’ (p. 85). For Sidney, it is poets – by which he means, in our terms, creative makers in a range of the arts – who best exemplify the human capacity to look beyond the material present and imagine new creative possibilities, in the process imitating ‘the inconceivable excellencies of God’. Two centuries later, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, writing at the height of the Romantic era, pushes this claim a significant stage further: The primary imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM. The secondary I consider as an echo of the former, coexisting with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still at all events it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead. (Coleridge 1985, p. 313) For Coleridge, what lifts the human imagination above the life of animals is its ability subjectively to represent, and thus (or then) to recreate, the world. In other words, mankind’s imaginative capacity has become commensurate with 2that of God the Creator – as grand a claim for human creativity as could readily be imagined in the early nineteenth century. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, David Amigoni and Gordon McMullan; individual chapters, the contributors.",0
Teaching master students of the direction «musical education» to conduct a scientific discussion in a foreign language,"Introduction. In modern education, against the backdrop of rapidly increasing processes of informatization and globalization as well as the requirements of specialists' mobility, one of the priorities is vocational-oriented education in foreign languages. It ensures the formation of students' ability to communicate in foreign languages in specific professional, business, scientific spheres and situations, taking into account the peculiarities of their future profession. The aims of this article are the following: to reveal the peculiarities of the organization of teaching foreign languages in the master's degree of a non-linguistic high school; to present effective methods, approaches, and techniques of working with master students of the direction of “Musical Education”. Methodology and research methods. In the process of the research, such theoretical scientific methods as analysis, synthesis, specification, and generalization were used. The experimental design of the present study was based on the concept of Lifelong Learning. The methods of interview, observation and testing were applied. Results and scientific novelty. The authors have developed a set of exercises for mastering the skills of conducting a scientific discussion by the master students of the direction “Music Education”.

Digital photos invite multisensory learning in literacy,"The author as teacher educator and her students as teacher candidates believe that social media can be used in almost any discipline to enhance teaching and learning. They conceptualized semiotics into early literacy by inviting children to bring photos in their iphones, talk about the stories in the photos, draw 4-6 pictures, and write one sentence below each picture. Semiotics is the study of signs like languages, arts, music, dance, drama which humans created to mediate the world. The purpose of this study are multifunctional: to develop the multisensory acquisition of five literacy skills in thinking, listening, speaking, writing and reading in a pleasant context. Both students from diversity and mainstream cultures acquire natural language for social functions. Based on research, most students of diversity need two years to develop the social language, while they need five years to obtain the academic language. Yet, this visual approach, in terms of photos, expedites the second language acquisition for social function towards academic success. © WMSCI 2018 - 22nd World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings.

"The Zurich corpus of vowel and voice quality, version 1.0","Existing databases of isolated vowel sounds or vowel sounds embedded in consonantal context generally document only limited variation of basic production parameters. Thus, concerning the possible variation range of vowel and voice quality-related sound characteristics, there is a lack of broad phenomenological and descriptive references that allow for a comprehensive understanding of vowel acoustics and for an evaluation of the extent to which corresponding existing approaches and models can be generalised. In order to contribute to the building up of such references, a novel database of vowel sounds that exceeds any existing collection by size and diversity of vocalic characteristics is presented here, comprised of c. 34 600 utterances of 70 speakers (46 nonprofessional speakers, children, women and men, and 24 professional actors/actresses and singers of straight theatre, contemporary singing, and European classical singing). The database focuses on sounds of the long Standard German vowels /i-y-e-ø-a-o-u/ produced with varying basic production parameters such as phonation type, vocal effort, fundamental frequency, vowel context and speaking or singing style. In addition, a read text and, for professionals, songs are also included. The database is accessible for scientific use, and further extensions are in progress. © 2018 International Speech Communication Association. All rights reserved.",0
"Manulex-MorphO, a database on French orthography taking morpho-phonograms into account","The consistency of grapheme-phoneme and phoneme-grapheme correspondences (GPhC-PhGC) is a key factor in learning to read and spell in an alphabetic writing system. It is therefore necessary to have statistics on these relationships in the written lexicon addressed to a child. Until now, these statistics were made independently of the morphology, which differentiates written from spoken French: most of inflectional morphemes are written but not pronounced (<s> in amis 'friends', tu chantes 'you sing', gris 'grey'); others are homophones but not homographs (<ais> and <ait> in chantais, chantait 'you-s/he sang'), which has a negative impact on learning to read and to spell. For these reasons, in Manulex-MorphO, we examined the contribution of morphology to the consistency of GPhC and PhGC. The article presents this database as well as potential uses in literacy programs. © 2018 Armand Colin. All Rights Reserved.",0
Hand-clapping to the rhythm of newly learned words improves l2 pronunciation: Evidence from Catalan and Chinese learners of French,"Previous research has shown that rhythmic training enhances phonological speech processing (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]). Yet little is known about whether rhythmic training can also help to improve pronunciation in a second language (but see [5, 6, 7]). This study tests the potential benefits of hand-clapping to the rhythm of newly learned French words for the acquisition of pronunciation patterns by Catalan children and Chinese adolescents. In two between-subjects experiments with a pretest and posttest design, participants either repeated words while clapping the rhythmic structure of words or only repeated the words. The French target words were very similar to their lexical counterparts in Catalan, whereas they differed completely from Chinese. Participants’ oral production before and after training was rated for accentedness by three French native speakers. Results showed a significant improvement for the clapping group among the Catalan participants, whereas only a near significant tendency appeared for the Chinese adolescents. Individual musical abilities did not interact significantly with the results in either experiments but working memory played a significant role in Chinese participants’ pronunciation. The results show that a short phonological training session based on highlighting the rhythmic structure of words seems to help improve pronunciation in a foreign language as long as there is little demand placed on semantic processing. © 2018, International Speech Communications Association.

Vowel space and f0 characteristics of infant-directed singing and speech,"When adults talk to infants, they dramatically change the prosodic and acoustic structure of speech. Recently, new insights have been gained on those changes, especially on the vocalic and temporal structure of speech which are described as being more variable than in adult conversations. In the present contribution, we examine formant and fundamental frequency characteristics of different infant-directed registers, notably infant-directed speech and singing, the latter not being investigated so far. We present data from 14 German-speaking mothers singing a playsong and reading a story to their 6 months old infants, or to the experimenter. Infant- and infantabsent versions of speech and song were compared on the formant characteristics of the primary vowel triangle (/i, a, u/) and on general fundamental frequency changes. Our results show that vowel space did not differ in infant- and infantabsent versions of speech and song. However, vowel dispersion, i.e., formant variability, was higher in both infantdirected song and speech than in infant-absent versions. Consistent with previous findings, f0 was higher in infantthan infant-absent versions of speech and song, with song showing generally higher f0. These results are discussed in light of current approaches to the variability of infant-directed registers, and their attractiveness to infants. © 2018, International Speech Communications Association.

The relationship between academic self-concept and professional interests of final grade primary school students,"In the eighth grade of primary school, students make their first decisions on further education and profession. These decisions are influenced by interests, as well as the assessments of one’s own competence in different domains of activity. The aim of this research is to determine the structure of the relationship between academic self-concept and professional interests. The sample of respondents is convenient and includes 286 eight-grade primary school students. For the purposes of the research, we constructed the instruments for the assessment of academic self-concept on the level of school subjects and professional interests, devised in accordance with the Holland’s RIASEC model. All scales had satisfactory psychometric properties. Using linear correlations and canonical correlation analysis, we attempted to determine whether the relationship between professional interests and academic self-concept suits the classification of school subjects according to Holland’s RIASEC themes. Linear correlations have partially confirmed the assumed relationships between the two constructs. Four pairs were extracted by the canonical correlation analysis, reflecting: 1) the global relationship between the two constructs; 2) the relationship of self-concept in foreign language, Serbian language and literature, art and music mostly with the artistic interest type, but also the social and conventional type; 3) the relationship of self-concept in biology, chemistry, but also history, with the investigative interest type; 4) for the most part, the relationship of self-concept in physical education and physics with the social and enterprising interest type. Although it has been confirmed that there is a positive relationship between the two constructs within Holland’s RIASEC themes, the assumed classification of school subjects depicts the relationships between the two sets of variables only in the simplified form. The contribution of this research is in enhancing the understanding of the relationship between the factors of educational and professional development. © 2018, Institute for Educational Research.

The significance of music in teaching Turkish,"The whole history of teaching foreign languages is, in a way, a search for the best methodologies of doing so. Methods of teaching can be seen as systems providing the optimal ways of getting basic knowledge of a foreign language for students. The existing wide variety of methods suggests the choice of those most efficient for particular individuals. Each of the methodologies used relies on a number of theoretical underpinnings. This article advances proposals on using music in teaching Turkish as a foreign language, based on the principles of suggestopedia - the psychology of positive teaching developed by G. Lozanov. It is claimed that suggestopedia helps students learn a foreign language 3 to 5 times faster than those who rely on traditional methods of study. Suggestopedia makes colloquial dialogues in a foreign language be pronounced and/or listened to in the same way as music, and music is used as a facilitating and motivating factor, without lyrics. However, teaching based on suggestopedia alone will not suffice, since in the classical form it is limited by adult audiences and small ones to boot. Other peculiarities of students and groups also have to be accounted for, such as their linguistic background: if their first language is a Turkic one, they can be expected to learn Turkish faster, since they are already familiar with the melodic mode of the language. It can nevertheless be postulated that the use of songs in language learning helps develop such skills as vocabulary, rules of grammar and correct pronunciation. Songs facilitate teaching new words, grammatical rules, learning direction, layout, numbers and demonstrative adjectives. This is both useful and interesting for all categories of learners, children as well as adults. © 2018 New Reaearch of Tuva. All rights reserved.",0
Developing local content syllabus for elementary school based on the English for young learners learning strategy to maintain Gorontalo cultures,"Local content is an elementary school subject that contains the Gorontalo language. It is continuously a concern of the government to maintain it. Unfortunately, the local content textbook used by the teachers seems monotonous and unattractive for both the teachers and the students. Based on the given questionnaire, the teachers generally indicated that the textbook was not colourful, the content was not attractive, and it was too tedious. Moreover, some teachers did not use any textbook but just browsed for material on the internet. This research intends to design a syllabus in the first year and to produce a textbook for local content subject in the second year by adapting the English for Young Learners learning strategy. The textbook is designed based on English language skills and language components. It utilizes songs, and games that encourage young learners to learn their native language. The content of the textbook describes about Gorontalo culture such as traditions and customs, historical sites, traditional foods and arts. This will lead the students to have two benefits in learning the Gorontalo language; they can learn their native language and Gorontalo culture at the same time. The study applies the Research and Development Method (Sugiyono, 2014, p. 297) to create the syllabus of local content with four main steps namely (1) identifying problems; (2) designing the syllabus; (3) validating the syllabus; (4) producing the product of syllabus. The syllabus as a main output of the study is expected to provide a new approach for both teachers and students by adapting the English for Young Learners learning strategies to the local content learning teaching process to maintain Gorontalo culture. © Asian EFL Journal 2018.",0
"Gendered household expectations: Neoliberal policies, graveyard shifts, and women’s responsibilities in Mumbai, India","In 1991, under the aegis of Manmohan Singh-the then finance minister of the Nationalist Congress Party (and subsequently the prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014)-the Indian state adopted neoliberal policies, resulting in reduced government spending on public institutions and infrastructure, and increased support to facilitate private development and foreign investment. As part of neoliberal restructuring, the state enacted policies to facilitate direct investment in call centers. India was a favored location for this sector, primarily because of a large English speaking and technically skilled workforce. Call centers prefer hiring women, stating that women are “naturally” docile and can nurture, making them well suited for this job. 1 Women constitute 51% of the workforce in call centers, 2 a higher gender ratio than any other jobs in the IT (information technology) sector in India. 3 The night shift required for such work also causes changes in domestic life, requiring female workers to alter strategies for social reproduction. 4 I conducted semi-structured interviews and participant observation to investigate how women adapt household responsibilities while working the night shift in call centers. From women’s narratives of their daily routines and life cycle, I gleaned implicit or explicit references to discourses of tradition and modernity that guided their choices. I identified trends that illustrate the nature of adaptations across my research participants. I find that several women justify their entry into a paid workforceparticularly jobs involving night shifts-through a household “crisis” narrative that necessitated this decision. For these women, as well as several others, entering the paid workforce does not reduce their sphere of household responsibility, often resulting in reduced hours of sleep to manage both. This continued gendering of social reproduction also transfers to an extended chain of dependence on other people, primarily female kin members, for services including childcare, cooking, and cleaning. Thus, traditional ideas of gendered household responsibility continue even as women play a significant role in the functioning of neoliberal modernization. This chapter contributes to feminist scholarship focusing on social reproduction, particularly demonstrating the centrality of “tradition” in continuing expectations for gendered responsibility even as women enter the “modern” workforce. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",0
Extramural exposure and language attainment: The examination of input-related variables in CLIL programmes,"This article documents the findings of a quantitative study to gauge the impact of CLIL and extramural exposure on foreign language attainment. The relationship between CLIL and input-related variables is examined from a double-fold perspective. First, it is determined if CLIL scenarios favour more extramural exposure to English (in the form of books and magazines, TV series and movies, the Internet and videogames, songs and private lessons). Then, we reveal if language outcomes are better by means of CLIL or Formal Instruction (FI) and how this varies according to type of school. Finally, we explore whether the language proficiency differential between the CLIL and the EFL groups can be ascribed to this extramural exposure or whether other variables (such as motivation, verbal intelligence, socioeconomic status, or the CLIL programme itself) account for the greatest proportion of variance. Ten public bilingual and charter schools (in Primary and Compulsory Secondary Education) in the autonomous community of Extremadura have taken part in the study, with a total of 156 CLIL learners and 162 EFL students. © 2018, Universidad de Granada.

Speaking a tone language enhances musical pitch perception in 3–5-year-olds,"Young children learn multiple cognitive skills concurrently (e.g., language and music). Evidence is limited as to whether and how learning in one domain affects that in another during early development. Here we assessed whether exposure to a tone language benefits musical pitch processing among 3–5-year-old children. More specifically, we compared the pitch perception of Chinese children who spoke a tone language (i.e., Mandarin) with English-speaking American children. We found that Mandarin-speaking children were more advanced at pitch processing than English-speaking children but both groups performed similarly on a control music task (timbre discrimination). The findings support the Pitch Generalization Hypothesis that tone languages drive attention to pitch in nonlinguistic contexts, and suggest that language learning benefits aspects of music perception in early development.

Out-of-school social activities among immigrant-origin children living in Ireland,"In recent years, the children of immigrants have become an integral part of the Irish national tapestry. This article sheds light on their social engagement outside the formal education system by exploring sports and cultural participation among the children of immigrants. Participating in sport, fitness and cultural pursuits provides children and young people with opportunities for enjoyment and social interaction and may ultimately strengthen community cohesion. In addition, cultural participation outside school has been found to enhance engagement and academic progress within school. The findings show that, at nine years of age, immigrant-origin children are less likely to take part in organised sports or structured cultural activities (such as music or dance classes) than their Irish peers. The participation gap is greater for those from non-English-speaking backgrounds and those whose families are from Eastern Europe, Africa or Asia. The gap between immigrant and Irish children’s leisure participation reduces over time, although involvement at nine has a notable influence on participation at 13 and involvement among Asian young people remains lower than among other groups. Lower self-reported popularity levels among immigrant-origin 13-year-olds are largely explained by lower levels of involvement in organised sports. The findings therefore have implications for ensuring the inclusion of immigrant children in out-of-school activities and for their integration more generally. © 2017, Economic and Social Studies.

Expository text comprehension in secondary school: for which readers does knowledge of connectives contribute the most?,"The present study examined whether knowledge of connectives contributes uniquely to expository text comprehension above and beyond reading fluency, general vocabulary knowledge and metacognitive knowledge. Furthermore, it was examined whether this contribution differs for readers with different language backgrounds or readers who vary in reading fluency, general vocabulary knowledge or metacognitive knowledge levels. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that knowledge of connectives explained individual differences in eighth graders' text comprehension (n = 171) on top of the variance accounted for by the control variables. Moreover, the contribution of knowledge of connectives to text comprehension depended on a reader's level of metacognitive knowledge: more metacognitive knowledge resulted in a larger association between knowledge of connectives and text comprehension. Reading fluency, vocabulary knowledge and language background did not interact with knowledge of connectives. Findings are interpreted in the context of the strategic use of connectives during expository text reading. What is already known about this topic? Connectives (words such as moreover, because and although) help the reader in establishing coherence between text parts. In primary school, for fifth graders, knowledge of connectives has been shown to be uniquely related to English text comprehension controlling for reading fluency and general vocabulary knowledge. For fifth graders, the relationship between knowledge of connectives and English text comprehension was higher for English-only students than for their peers who learned English as a second language. What this paper adds: The present study found that knowledge of connectives also has a unique relation with Dutch expository text comprehension for eighth graders above and beyond reading fluency, general vocabulary knowledge and metacognitive knowledge (about text structure and reading and writing strategies). The relationship between knowledge of connectives and text comprehension was not moderated by reading fluency, general vocabulary knowledge and language background (monolingual versus bilingual Dutch). Metacognitive knowledge did impact the relationship between knowledge of connectives and text comprehension: the higher the metacognitive knowledge, the higher the association between knowledge of connectives and text comprehension. Implications for theory, policy or practice Secondary school readers are assumed to benefit from knowing connectives because these words are frequent in expository texts and signal relationships that students may often not infer without the help of these devices (i.e., with the use of background knowledge). This seems to apply in particular for expository texts that are intended to convey new information and relationships to students (see also Singer & O'Connell,). We found a significant interaction between knowledge of connectives and metacognitive knowledge, which seems to indicate that knowing more connectives does not help much in improving expository text comprehension when metacognitive knowledge about text structure and reading strategies is low. This result suggests that it may be wise to couple instruction on the meaning of connectives with instruction about the structure of expository texts and ways to strategically deal with these texts. More specifically, besides instruction on the meaning of connectives, we advise teachers in secondary school to get students to understand the importance of connectives as markers of local and global coherence in texts, and to teach them how to strategically use connectives during reading.

Writing system modulates the association between sensitivity to acoustic cues in music and reading ability: Evidence from Chinese-English bilingual children,"Music and language share many attributes and a large body of evidence shows that sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is positively related to language development and even subsequent reading acquisition. However, such association was mainly found in alphabetic languages. What remains unclear is whether sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is associated with reading in Chinese, a morphosyllabic language. The present study aimed to answer this question by measuring music (i.e., musical metric perception and pitch discrimination), language (i.e., phonological awareness, lexical tone sensitivity), and reading abilities (i.e., word recognition) among 54 third-grade Chinese-English bilingual children. After controlling for age and non-verbal intelligence, we found that both musical metric perception and pitch discrimination accounted for unique variance of Chinese phonological awareness while pitch discrimination rather than musical metric perception predicted Chinese lexical tone sensitivity. More importantly, neither musical metric perception nor pitch discrimination was associated with Chinese reading. As for English, musical metric perception and pitch discrimination were correlated with both English phonological awareness and English reading. Furthermore, sensitivity to acoustic cues in music was associated with English reading through the mediation of English phonological awareness. The current findings indicate that the association between sensitivity to acoustic cues in music and reading may be modulated by writing systems. In Chinese, the mapping between orthography and phonology is not as transparent as in alphabetic languages such as English. Thus, this opaque mapping may alter the auditory perceptual sensitivity in music to Chinese reading. © 2017 Zhang, Meng, Wu and Zhou.",0
Using music to reduce anxiety among older adults in the emergency department: a randomized pilot study,"Background An emergency department (ED) visit may be distressing and anxiety-provoking for older adults (age > 65 years). No studies have specifically evaluated the effect of music listening on anxiety in older adults in the ED. Objective The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of music listening on anxiety levels in older ED patients. Design, Setting, Participants and Interventions This was a randomized pilot study in the geriatric ED of an urban academic tertiary medical center. This was a sample of English-speaking adults (age > 65 years) who were not deaf (n = 35). Subjects consented to participate and were randomized to receive up to 60 min of music listening with routine care, while the control group received routine care with no music. Subjects in the music treatment group received headphones and an electronic tablet with pre-downloaded music, and were allowed to choose from 5 selections. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was change in anxiety levels, measured by the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), at enrollment and 1 h later. Results A total of 35 participants were enrolled: 74% were female, 40% were white, and 40% were black; of these, 32 subjects completed the study protocol. When comparing control (n = 18) against intervention subjects (n = 17), there were no significant differences in enrollment STAI scores (43.00 ± 15.00 vs. 40.30 ± 12.80, P = 0.57). STAI scores 1 hour after enrollment (after the music intervention) were significantly reduced in the intervention subjects compared to the control subjects (with reduction of 10.00 ± 12.29 vs. 1.88 ± 7.97, P = 0.03). Conclusion These pilot results suggest that music listening may be an effective tool for reducing anxiety among older adults in the ED. © 2017 Journal of Integrative Medicine Editorial Office.

Mothers Consistently Alter Their Unique Vocal Fingerprints When Communicating with Infants,"The voice is the most direct link we have to others’ minds, allowing us to communicate using a rich variety of speech cues [1, 2]. This link is particularly critical early in life as parents draw infants into the structure of their environment using infant-directed speech (IDS), a communicative code with unique pitch and rhythmic characteristics relative to adult-directed speech (ADS) [3, 4]. To begin breaking into language, infants must discern subtle statistical differences about people and voices in order to direct their attention toward the most relevant signals. Here, we uncover a new defining feature of IDS: mothers significantly alter statistical properties of vocal timbre when speaking to their infants. Timbre, the tone color or unique quality of a sound, is a spectral fingerprint that helps us instantly identify and classify sound sources, such as individual people and musical instruments [5–7]. We recorded 24 mothers’ naturalistic speech while they interacted with their infants and with adult experimenters in their native language. Half of the participants were English speakers, and half were not. Using a support vector machine classifier, we found that mothers consistently shifted their timbre between ADS and IDS. Importantly, this shift was similar across languages, suggesting that such alterations of timbre may be universal. These findings have theoretical implications for understanding how infants tune in to their local communicative environments. Moreover, our classification algorithm for identifying infant-directed timbre has direct translational implications for speech recognition technology. Piazza et al. report a novel feature of motherese. When communicating with their infants, mothers shift the summary statistics of their vocal spectra, thereby altering their unique timbre fingerprints. This shift generalizes across a wide variety of languages and thus may be a universal form of communication with infants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0
"Art, science and magic: Music and math the classroom","Music1 and mathematics are two closely-related subjects as both enclose numbers, proportions, measurements, operations... Pythagoras was the first person to link them, and from that moment on, many questions have been asked and many research lines have been created in order to study how one affects the other. Also, music contributes many benefits for the cognitive development of the students, positively contributing to their integral education, as it plays a fundamental role in the acquisition and the strengthening of knowledge during the learning process. However, there are very few experiences and materials to work with it in an interdisciplinary manner within the school context, especially in Spain. In order to verify if music instruction or lessons benefit the study of mathematics, a research study was conducted on 68 4th-grade students enrolled in a Spanish primary school. A questionnaire, observations of many sessions and interviews given to three teachers were used for the gathering of data. The results gathered confirmed that musical training has a positive influence on academic performance of mathematics students. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",0
"""Interact and 'discover' the greek culture"": Using tablets and interactive video as tools for learning a second/foreign language","This study aimed at creating a digital learning environment with a focus on enhancing language skills in a second/ foreign language and developing cultural awareness. CLIL was used as a modern approach to teaching a second/ foreign language in synergy with technologies in order to create the digital context entitled ""a digital tour to Greece and Greek culture"" by using the web platform for courses named Learnworlds. The three basic characteristics of our project are: a) self-regulated learning within the classroom environment, b) the use of tablets in pairs c) the use of interactive video as a basic means of content delivery. For the purpose of the study, we designed ten thematic sections, related to the geographical and cultural characteristics of ten areas in Greece, providing 14 immigrant children (aged between eleven and twelve years old) with the opportunity to participate in a digital tour. During their 'tour,' the children, in pairs, would access the cultural elements of each geographical area through authentic texts, photographs, interactive videos, songs, dimensional representations, etc. They solved quizzes, crosswords, multiple structured activities, and they took part in communicative activities in a natural and playful interactive environment offering them opportunities to enhance the receptive and productive skills in the target language and develop awareness in the target culture. The evaluation of this project was carried out by using both formative and summative instruments, such as the researcher's diary, the think aloud process with the children as well as a satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the project. The results revealed children's great interest in the project, their active participation in the activities and their ability to interact and communicate effectively. Overall, they became familiar with the use of software; they enhanced their language skills and developed their cultural awareness, in an authentic, interactive and challenging learning environment. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Interweaving tapestries of culture and sexuality in the Caribbean,"This book brings together the most recent work of Caribbean psychologists in the English-speaking islands of Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad on gender and sexuality. The authors analyse the unique challenges posed by contradictions between cultural values and modern sexual expression in the region. They examine a broad range of topics such as conceptions of gender roles in primary school children, sexual behavior and emotional social intelligence in adolescents, and sexual identities and orientations in adults. Chapters cover issues including how women who have sex with women (WSWs) self-identify, the 'Lebenswelt' (life world) of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica, transsexual care and its psychological impact, the influence of music on sexuality, how intimacy is defined, as well as the relationship between identity formation and the fear of intimacy in Jamaica, and the practice of polyamory in Jamaica and Trinidad. This distinctive collection is the first of its kind, grounded in both qualitative and quantitative research. It presents a sophisticated comparative analyses of the cultures of the Anglophone Caribbean represented by Trinidad, Jamaica and Barbados to offer a broader discussions of intimacy and relationships. With practical implications for therapy, it will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners of gender and sexuality studies, psychology and culture. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.

An experience of the application of Augmented Reality to learn English in Infant Education,"The current study presents an educational experience using augmented reality technology aimed at improving vocabulary acquisition and grammatical structures in English while introducing curricular contents of emotional intelligence in a CLIL approach. The presented Didactic Unit incorporates Augmented Reality activities to encourage autonomous learning through exploration which also includes self-evaluation. The proposal incorporates images and audio to facilitate content learning and introduces phonetics from the Infant Education stage using narrations and songs. The evaluation that has taken place in six different classrooms points out a very positive acceptance of the methodology by students. In addition, the learning results have significantly improved, which may be, to some extent, related to the methodology used. © 2017 IEEE.",0
"Listen, do, repeat, understand and remember: Teaching English to very young children in Aceh","This qualitative study investigated the methods used in teaching English vocabulary to very young children (i.e. Toddlers) at a bilingual school in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Not much research has been published on teaching English to toddlers in the EFL context; therefore, this research is important as the results can become additional input to L2 teachers who teach very young children because by understanding their conditions of learners, teachers can help them reach their full potential as language learners. An observation sheet and a set of interview questions were used to collect data from an English teacher. There was only one teacher who became the participant because the school under study is thus far the only school that provides an English learning environment for children as young as toddlers in the city of Banda Aceh. The class was observed for three class meetings. The results showed that of the four teaching methods observed, the most commonly employed method was Total Physical Response (TPR), followed by Natural Approach (NA), Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and Suggestopedia (SG) as the least. Furthermore, based on the interview with the teacher, it was indicated that TPR and NA were more appropriate for teaching the toddlers English vocabulary. Through TPR, the very young children demonstrated their understanding of commands by responding with simple answers or gestures. In NA, they were situated in a natural environment and not prompted to speak until they felt ready to do so. Additionally, the teacher used no specific textbooks because music, pictures, and authentic materials procured an immense role in supporting the activities in the classroom. © Urmia University Press. 2017.",0
After a hundred years: The Afrikaans of the first language commission,"After a hundred years the Afrikaans of the first Taalkommissie (Language Commission) of 1917 differs radically from the Afrikaans that is covered by the rules contained in the eleventh issue of the Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls (Afrikaans Word List and Spelling Rules) (AWS 11). These differences will in future probably become even greater. The Afrikaans that before 1917 had run its natural course towards becoming the written form, was passed over and a Dutchified Afrikaans was standardised. How did this happen? Circumstances beyond the control of the Afrikaans linguistic community resulted in the standardisation of Afrikaans in 1917. The change in government in Britain in 1905 gave rise to a series of reactions which in 1910 resulted in Unification in South Africa. In the new constitution of the time, English was no longer retained as the only official language but recognition was given to two languages: English and Dutch. Dutch, which then unexpectedly became one of the two official languages of the Union of South Africa, could be accommodated culturally in the Zuid-Afrikaanse Akademie voor Taal, Letteren en Kunst (the South African Academy for Language, Literature and Art) (hereafter referred to as ""the Academy""), which was founded in 1909. The language of the Academy was Dutch (in terms of the draft statute). At the founding meeting of the Academy it was proposed that Afrikaans be one of the languages of the Academy. This proposal was not accepted and Afrikaans was perforce included in article 2 of the founding charter with the explanation that it was included with Dutch. The Academy inter alia strove to promote the teaching of Dutch (""'t onderwys van 't Holland"") (article 3). Afrikaans was not recognised in the Constitution of the Union or in the Statute of the Academy as an independent language, even though it was the language spoken in the largest area in South Africa during the nineteenth century, by more people than either Dutch or English. Various groupings of Afrikaans-speakers wrote Afrikaans in different ways: in the Bo-Kaap as a religious language (with an adapted Arabic and Malay orthography), in Genadendal, in the Paarl, where middle-class Farming Afrikaans was written - a variety that was customarily used during the nineteenth century and was significantly influenced by Khoi Afrikaans - at mission stations and by newspaper editors and entertainment entrepreneurs. How to standardise these various ways in which Afrikaans was written? This was still music of the future. C.J. Langenhoven in 1914 convinced three of the four Provincial Councils to introduce Afrikaans on the first levels at primary schools, and he undertook to obtain the support of the Academy for this. The Academy had a stated educational responsibility in respect of Dutch. C.J. Langenhoven lay claim to this, but he did so on behalf of Afrikaans. The 1914 annual meeting of the Academy supported C.J. Langenhoven's plan with Afrikaans as language of education and appointed a commission to take care of the writing and spelling of Afrikaans. The use by the pro-Dutch Zuid-AfrikaanscheTaalbond (South African Language Association) of the Simplified Dutch Spelling (""VHS"") dominated language education (except for English) in South Africa from 1904.The pro-Afrikaans Afrikaanse Taalvereniging (Afrikaans Language Society) (""ATV"") also to a large extent used the VHS spelling system. The Academy's spelling commission was compromised by agreements that C.J. Langenhoven and his supporters had made with the Taalbond and the ATV before the 1909 Annual Meeting so as to obtain their cooperation in order to carry through his education plan, and they had to adhere to the current Dutch writing conventions during the compilation of AWS1, which agreement was protected in a Principle until 1992. These spelling concessions by C.J. Langenhoven resulted in Dutchified written Afrikaans. Afrikaans-speakers continued to speak their different types of Afrikaans, which differed in many respects from the written Standard Afrikaans, and which were increasingly influenced by it. The language of Afrikaans dialects, particularly with a basis of Khoi and Malay, was quite different from Dutch. The Afrikaans of these varieties differed significantly from Standard Afrikaans and was kept out of the standard variety, inter alia on the basis that it was not ""customary"" or ""civilised"". Language Commissions, from AWS 3, continued ""Afrikaansifications"" in the Word Lists, but the consequences of the 1914 Dutchification are still to be found in the spelling of Afrikaans. And AWS 11, after a 100 years? For the first time, after a full century has elapsed, the Preface to AWS 11 confirms that the different varieties of Afrikaans form part of Standard Afrikaans and that the Language Commission encourages the development and use thereof, and that in the long run it may change and modify Standard Afrikaans.",0
Technology enhanced instruction: An example of english language learning in the context of peace,"Early childhood quality education is a cornerstone in educational development. Many countries have started to develop their own preschool educational system in accordance with the European Union Standards, where learning English language and using technology are prerequisites. In this research, the peace context was used as a mediator for learning the English language. The study aimed to reveal the impact of learning through technology in the English language. It was conducted on five-year-old children (n = 18( in one class where the English language was the core subject. The acquisition of knowledge depended on in-class gamification activities and home activities. Each participant received an educational DVD to use at home that included all the materials for learning, such as words, songs, videos, and short films about peace in English. All materials were selected in according with the ""fair use policy"" for educational purposes. The research process included an initial interview (checklist) in which content analyses were made. In addition, assessment software was developed based on the required analysis to explain statistical findings. © Authors.",0
Hierarchical organization in the temporal structure of infant-direct speech and song,"Caregivers alter the temporal structure of their utterances when talking and singing to infants compared with adult communication. The present study tested whether temporal variability in infant-directed registers serves to emphasize the hierarchical temporal structure of speech. Fifteen German-speaking mothers sang a play song and told a story to their 6-months-old infants, or to an adult. Recordings were analyzed using a recently developed method that determines the degree of nested clustering of temporal events in speech. Events were defined as peaks in the amplitude envelope, and clusters of various sizes related to periods of acoustic speech energy at varying timescales. Infant-directed speech and song clearly showed greater event clustering compared with adult-directed registers, at multiple timescales of hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. We discuss the relation of this newly discovered acoustic property to temporal variability in linguistic units and its potential implications for parent-infant communication and infants learning the hierarchical structures of speech and language. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0
"The language of empire: Myths and metaphors of popular imperialism, 1880-1918","The debate about the Empire dealt in idealism and morality, and both sides employed the language of feeling, and frequently argued their case in dramatic terms. This book opposes two sides of the Empire, first, as it was presented to the public in Britain, and second, as it was experienced or imagined by its subjects abroad. British imperialism was nurtured by such upper middle-class institutions as the public schools, the wardrooms and officers' messes, and the conservative press. The attitudes of 1916 can best be recovered through a reconstruction of a poetics of popular imperialism. The case-study of Rhodesia demonstrates the almost instant application of myth and sign to a contemporary imperial crisis. Rudyard Kipling was acknowledged throughout the English-speaking world not only as a wonderful teller of stories but as the 'singer of Greater Britain', or, as 'the Laureate of Empire'. In the last two decades of the nineteenth century, the Empire gained a beachhead in the classroom, particularly in the coupling of geography and history. The Island Story underlined that stories of heroic soldiers and 'fights for the flag' were easier for teachers to present to children than lessons in morality, or abstractions about liberty and responsible government. The Education Act of 1870 had created a need for standard readers in schools; readers designed to teach boys and girls to be useful citizens. The Indian Mutiny was the supreme test of the imperial conscience, a measure of the morality of the 'master-nation'. © Manchester University Press 1994. All rights reserved.",0
Translanguaging approach to TESOL in Taiwan,"Informed by the concepts of multiliteracy and multimodality, the term ""translanguaging"" (García & Li, 2014) highlights the changing nature of language in action in a reality in which linguistic symbols and resources from multiple languages are utilized together with other meaning-carrying modes such as gestures, texts, pictures, and songs. The rationale for a translanguaging approach in ELT stems from the changing roles of a language teacher, from providing linguistic knowledge and skills to building learners' self-learning capacity, learner agency and L2 identities. Instead of passively memorizing linguistic rules, self-learning learners play with newly-acquired linguistic resources to merge them into their existing personal repertoire and linguistic identities. This paper discusses the viability of a translanguaging approach in TESOL in Taiwanese contexts. The background and rationale for the need of translanguaging is first presented. After expounding the concept of translanguaging and how it differs from code-mixing, the benefits, limitations, and potentials of the translanguaging approach are addressed. We then use an example of translanguaging practices in an EFL classroom in a rural junior high school in Taiwan to illustrate the potentials of translanguaging pedagogy for developing learner agency and identities.",0
The Ashgate research companion to Japanese music,"Music is a frequently neglected aspect of Japanese culture. It is in fact a highly problematic area, as the Japanese actively introduced Western music into their modern education system in the Meiji period (1868-1911), creating westernized melodies and instrumental instruction for Japanese children from kindergarten upwards. As a result, most Japanese now have a far greater familiarity with Western (or westernized) music than with traditional Japanese music. Traditional or classical Japanese music has become somewhat ghettoized, often known and practised only by small groups of people in social structures which have survived since the pre-modern era. Such marginalization of Japanese music is one of the less recognized costs of Japan's modernization. On the other hand, music in its westernized and modernized forms has an extremely important place in Japanese culture and society, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, for example, being so widely known and performed that it is arguably part of contemporary Japanese popular and mass culture. Japan has become a world leader in the mass production of Western musical instruments and in innovative methodologies of music education (Yamaha and Suzuki). More recently, the Japanese craze of karaoke as a musical entertainment and as musical hardware has made an impact on the leisure and popular culture of many countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas. This is the first book to cover in detail all genres including court music, Buddhist chant, theatre music, chamber ensemble music and folk music, as well as contemporary music and the connections between music and society in various periods. The book is a collaborative effort, involving both Japanese and English speaking authors, and was conceived by the editors to form a balanced approach that comprehensively treats the full range of Japanese musical culture. © Alison McQueen Tokita, David W.

The fluid infusion of musical culture: embodied experiences in a grade one classroom,"Children’s daily, embodied music experiences are integral to how children live and function in the world. Growing out of a line of work focusing on the interplay between elementary children’s daily experiences of music, both in- and out-of-school and the impact on elementary music education curriculum, this research is nested within the theoretical discourses of experience, children’s musical culture, and children’s agency. Building upon this work, findings from a two-phase, 6-month inquiry, situated in an urban, Canadian, Grade 1 French Immersion classroom, draw upon the tools of ethnography and narrative inquiry, with the intention of deepening understandings of how informal music-making and sound function in children’s lives. Phase one findings highlight: (1) the frequency and spontaneity of children’s daily music experiences, both in- and out-of-school, (2) the nature of how music and sound function fluidly in a variety of contexts as integral to children’s experience, and (3) the power of musical behaviours in assisting young children to acquire French vocabulary and literacy skills. Important considerations for teacher education include: the necessity of creating space in elementary curriculum to engage children in music-making, integrating and infusing the Arts fluidly across the curriculum, and encouraging children autonomy in their musical engagement. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0
From childhood to chivalry: The education of the English kings and aristocracy 1066-1530,"Originally published in 1984, this is a study of the kings and the aristocracy who ruled England between the Conquest and the Reformation. Not, as usual, about their adult lives, but how they became the people they were through childhood and education. The first such study of its kind, it follows noble boys and girls from birth through the care of their nurses, masters and mistresses, until they left home for further training in noble households, monasteries and universities. The author examines the theories and treatises on noble education, again for the first time. The rest of the book broadens into a wide cultural survey as Dr Orme describes the skills and ideas which noble children learnt. He explains how they mastered speech and literacy; worship and behaviour; dancing, music and applied art; athletics and training for war. This part of the study is a handbook of noble pursuits in medieval times. In his final chapter the author considers the nature of noble education in the middles ages, and examines how and whether it changed at the Renaissance. Nicholas Orme has written a comprehensive study, spanning 450 years of English history and making a major contribution to social and cultural history, as well as the history of education. His book will be invaluable to historians and medievalists of all disciplines, and essential reading from those who study the Renaissance. © 1984 Nicholas Orme.",0
"Après-propos anthony decasper, explorer of a new psychology of intimate intentions in understanding","Forty years ago, Tony DeCasper developed a new psychology of childhood, which would transform scientific understanding of motives we share. By adapting an operant method to study the initiative of the infant seeking experience, he clarified how human actions are generated in measures of time in the mind. His method offered the newborn the opportunity to direct the sensations of their sucking movements to select experiences. He proved the fetus could learn the mother's voice and appreciate the rhythms and melodies of her movements. With colleagues in the University of Carolina and in Paris he explored for the musical dynamics and emotions of narratives in shared life that animate learning of speech and language, and other cultural skills. With French colleagues, he recorded changes in heartbeat to detect the emotions of a fetus, and to show their enjoyment of songs and rhymes recited by the mother. Inspired by the courage and imagination of Tony's life in science, we believe that the aesthetic and moral evaluations of human experience are an essential part of our autopoeitic nature, not only products of acquired reasoning and symbolic representation. © NecPlus.

From minstrel to courtier- the royal musique de chambre and courtly ideals in sixteenth-century France,"So where does this leave the aristocratic practitioner a Ia Castiglione who had emerged aronnd the tum of the sixteenth century, whose accomplishments were now professionalized and usurped by a group of specialists? The answer to this question is not simple; early modern French people fonnd themselves divided on just this point. Thomas Pelletier, writing in 1604 on the topic of noble education, explains: Lute playing is counted among the skills that a gentleman should learn. And there are some fathers who believe that their sons have learned nothing of worth if they have not acquired that accomplishment. There are others who, on the contrary, do not think it so necessary or honorable that they would wish their child to spend half the time necessary to gain even a passable abihty on the instrument … If it is rejoindered that the lute makes them seen and honored in company, I hold that on the contrary it rather makes them scorned, because a gentleman of a truly good family should take pleasure from others without serving to give them pleasure himself. 17 Clearly the stigma attached to the figure of the performing musician had persisted despite the gains in status that particular kinds of musical activity had made over the previous hnndred years. A better tide for this study thus may be Minstrel and Courtier: for by the end of sixteenth century the chamber musicians of the French royal household combined elements of both of these figures, joined in a new type of royal servant whose activities were integral to the functioning of the early modern court. © Sean Gallagher 2013.",0
The first English (EFL) lesson: Initial settings or the emergence of a playful classroom culture,"This discourse-based micro-ethnographic study scrutinizes the various forms of play that are a recurrent and salient feature of a first English (EFL) lesson in a Dutch secondary school context. In the first part of the lesson collective speaking formats associated with cultural games and routines in early L1-acquisition overwhelmingly have the floor. All-class chorusing, rhymes and chants create affordances for off-record and intermittent participation modes in peer-scaffolded speaking and whispering slots. They mediate the transition from (over)hearer to (co)speaker and allow learners to find their voice in the new language - on the basis of self-selection. Individual student voices (even disrespectful ones) are also dialogically modeled by the teacher for taskrelated 'serious' business in playful asides in the shared L1 metalanguage (duallanguage teaching strategies). Cued by prosodic shifts, rhythmic variation and other multimodal/semiotic behavioral features, these complex footing changes (Goffman 1979) and (re)framing practices are taken up by individual learners towards the end of the lesson. In the context of an IRF sequence that elicits formulaic phrases in the L2, they spontaneously create virtual identities and playful speaking roles for themselves. Instances of play may, however, present interpretive problems for next speakers. Since play is by definition parasitic on other templates or interactional norms, the challenge is to reflect online created ambiguities in the models we develop to articulate discourse complexity in multiparty classroom floors. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter, Inc., Boston/Berlin.

Warrior culture,"Throughout the antebellum period, a warrior spirit animated American culture, and the skill and bravery of heroic individuals, as opposed to professional armies, gained public attention and fame. As Marcus Cunliffe has pointed out, between 1775 and 1865, the martial spirit in America was “warlike but unmilitary” and had a long foreground: “For several generations of colonial settlers, fighting and bloodshed were inescapable. The French, the Spanish and the Indians were real enemies, as a hundred American communities could testify … By the end of the Revolutionary War nearly every town of any size in the colonies had been attacked or occupied, or both, by the British. The Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War and a score of campaigns against the Indians kept alive the traditions of belligerence.” These traditions became infused with a heightened romanticism in the wake of the Revolution, due to the enormous popularity of the writings of Sir Walter Scott. As the publisher Samuel Goodrich recalled, “Everybody read these works; everybody - the refined and the simple - shared in the delightful dreams which seemed to transport them to remote ages and distant climes, and made them live and breathe in the presence of the stern Covenanters of Scotland, the gallant bowmen of Sherwood Forest, or even the Crusaders in Palestine!"" Books, periodicals, illustrations, paintings, sculptures, and songs all represented the martial exploits of men such as George Washington, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Andrew Jackson, and even William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, in terms of the chivalric ideal, despite the emergent democracy of the new nation. Almost all American writers of the antebellum period were influenced by Scott, most notably the historical novelists Cooper, Hawthorne, and Simms. His appeal extended to women authors as well, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, who as a girl memorized passages from Scott, and as an adult read his books to her children and servants. Margaret Fuller likewise became enamored with Scott at an early age, and in 1849, as she watched Garibaldi lancers galloping through Rome during the revolution there, she told her New-York Tribune readers: “I longed for Sir Walter Scott to be on earth again, and see them; all are light, athletic, resolute figures, many of the forms of the finest manly beauty of the South, all sparkling with its genius and ennobled by the resolute spirit, ready to dare, to do, to die.” © Cambridge University Press 2017.",0
Toys and communication: An introduction,"This chapter is an overview of Toys and Communication and introduces some of the themes raised in the book’s additional 15 chapters. The first section borrows from Sutton-Smith’s (Ambiguity of play, Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, 1997) ‘rhetorics of play’ to position toys in the global media market, in institutions including school and family, and in relation to other forms of play, such as games and videogames. Toys and their meanings in play can be seen as aspects of communication and the transmission of culture. Giving and receiving toys reflects and imparts cultural practices and beliefs. Some forms of play, such as parent-child play or block play, are directly related to language and communication skills. Amanda Gummer reviews theory and research on toys, play and language development. Particular toys are homologous with particular types of speech and action. Miniature toy versions of everyday objects stimulate related play themes and the scaffolding of language skills. Musical toys appear to promote spatial reasoning, memory, math, and language. Miniature cooking sets develop a child’s sense of comfort, home, and set the stage for lifelong food preferences. Four anthropological chapters show the interplay between culture, toy-making, and play in rural India, Morocco, 1930s pre-war Germany, and Greece during the German occupation. Three chapters describe ways in which play influences toy design and design influences play. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.",0

The vocative chant and beyond: German calling melodies under routine and urgent contexts,"This paper investigates calling melodies produced by 21 Standard German native speakers on a discourse completion task across two contexts: (i) routine context?calling a child from afar to come in for dinner; (ii) urgent context?calling a child from afar for a chastising. The intent of this investigation is to bring attention to other calling melodies found in German beside the vocative chant and to give an insight to their acoustic profile. Three major melodies were identified in the two contexts: vocative chant (100% of routine context productions), urgent call (100% of male urgent context productions, 52.2% female productions), and stern call (47.8% female urgent context productions). A subsequent quantitative analysis was carried out on these calls across these parameters: (i) tonal scaling at tonal landmarks; (ii) proportional alignment of selected tonal landmarks with respect to the stressed or last vowel; and (iii) amplitude (integral and RMS) and (iv) duration of the stressed vowel, stressed syllable, and word. The resulting data were analyzed using a linear mixed model approach. The results point to significant differences in the contours produced in the aforementioned parameters. We also proposed a phonological description of the contours in the framework of Autosegmental-Metrical Phonology. Copyright © 2017 ISCA.",0
Technology in music education in england and across europe,"In this chapter, adopting an autobiographical perspective, I reflect upon the use of music technology within English school classrooms during the last 50 years. The chapter illustrates that this has become so important-particularly for creative work-that formal music technology examination syllabi for older students now exist alongside courses that focus on “traditional” music skills. The chapter also discusses the less positive position of information communications technology within the music curricula for primary school children and secondary students aged 11-14, and offers thoughts on the future of music technology within the English education system. As a backdrop to the discussion the chapter presents a short reflection on music technological developments in society during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The chapter also includes the perspectives of music educators from a wide range of European countries, during the period 2008-2011, on the position of music technology within their own educational contexts. © Oxford University Press 2017.",0
Sephardic poetry for children: From oral tradition to contemporary lullabies,"Poetry for children is a literary genre with its own characteristics, both in the form and in the content, which plays an important social role in all cultures. Firstly, we propose an analysis of the main characteristics of poetry for children in the Sephardic oral tradition. The second part of the article is devoted to the study of the lullabies and nursery rhymes composed by two contemporary authors, Beatriz Mazliah and Ada Gattegno Saltiel, who write poetry for children in Judeo-Spanish in a moment when this language is close to extinction. The question asked is what the cultural significance of writing poetry for children in a language which is no longer spoken by children is.",0
Contacts and cooperation between German musicology and the French Society of Musicology in the 1920s,"This paper addresses the contacts between the Sociétéfrançaise de musicologie and German musicologists in the nineteen-twenties, as well as the coverage of French musicological research in German periodicals of that time. The reception of French musicology in Germany after the First World War was complicated by the political and institutional situation, as Germans had only restricted access to international organizations. Nevertheless, in its early years, the SFM accepted members from both Germany and Austria (primarily in 1926 and 1929) and established contacts with libraries as well as with some German-speaking scholars, most of whom were in the early stages of their careers. A growing interest in French research can be observed in the German musicological periodicals (e.g. Zeitschrift fur Musikwissenschaft, Die Musik, Signale fur die musikalische Welt), even though competition between the two nations remains a dominant theme. At major international musicological conferences organized by the Union musicologique and by the Société internationale de musicologie, the relationship between both Germany and France was explicitly addressed, and the hope for closer international collaboration was expressed; in particular, the activities of such scholars as Prunières, Pirro, and Tiersot, were reported upon. In the later nineteen-twenties, articles by German musicologists attempted to analyze what appeared to be the methodological differences between the allegedly historico-philological style as it was practiced in France, and the humanities-driven approach as it was practiced in Germany, even though this opposition, not only national, is in fact a rather more general feature of musicology itself.",0
The contribution of world literature's rhymes to Foreign language acquisition,"Children are more motivated and stimulated in the foreign language classroom when authentic materials (rhymes, songs, realia) are used. Authentic materials increase the children's level of involvement and concentration. Exposing students to such language forms will enable them to cope with genuine interaction, whether it is inside or outside the classroom. There is an important reason is that rhymes make up a powerful means of teaching English at primary ages. With help of rhymes the lexical aspect of communication is formed. Rhymes make it possible for students to learn appropriate set of words, which later might be constructed into simple sentences. Rhymes are useful to enlarge the vocabulary background of children, to develop pupils' listening and speaking skills. Also they show many aspects of the culture of each society as they occur in all phases of our life, from birth to death. Since they play an important role in the process of learning and using our mother tongue, they are also quite important in the learning of foreign language, and especially for young learners. Along this article, we aim to describe the importance of using rhymes in the teaching of English as a foreign language at a primary level. © Serials Publications.",0
Some benefits of proverbs and sayings in foreign language classes,"Long observed are the wisdom and spirit of people appearing in their proverbs and sayings, myths, legends, fairytales and folk songs. Therefore, the knowledge of proverbs and sayings helps promote better understanding of the thoughtway and character of the folk. Proverbs and sayings represent a national cultural heritage and are a favoured material for learning in a foreign language class. They give students primary information about grammar, syntax and phraseology, and information about the culture of the target language country. In addition, they make speech lively and eloquent. The paper presents some practical recommendations and exercises on the use of proverbs and saying in a foreign language class.",0
Papilian'S anatomy: - Celebrating six decades -,"Victor Papilian was born an artist, during high school he studied music in order to become a violinist in two professional orchestras in Bucharest. Later on he enrolled in the school of medicine, being immediately attracted by anatomy. After graduating, with a briliant dissertation, he became a member of the faculty and continued to teach in his preferred field. His masters, Gh. Marinescu and Victor Babes, proposed him for the position of professor at the newly established Faculty of Medicine of Cluj. Here he reorganized the department radically, created an anatomy museum and edited the first dissection handbook and the first Romanian anatomy (descriptive and topographic) treatise, both books received with great appreciation. He received the Romanian Academy Prize. His knowledge and skills gained him a well deserved reputation and he created a prestigious school of anatomy. He published over 250 scientific papers in national and international journals, ranging from morphology to functional, pathological and anthropological topics. He founded the Society of Anthropology, with its own newsletter; he was elected as a member of the French Society of Anatomy. In parallel he had a rich artistic and cultural activity as writer and playwright: he was president of the Transylvanian Writers' Society, editor of a literary review, director of the Cluj theater and opera, leader of a book club and founder of a symphony orchestra.",0
Training early literacy related skills: To which degree does a musical training contribute to phonological awareness development?,"Well-developed phonological awareness skills are a core prerequisite for early literacy development. Although effective phonological awareness training programs exist, children at risk often do not reach similar levels of phonological awareness after the intervention as children with normally developed skills. Based on theoretical considerations and first promising results the present study explores effects of an early musical training in combination with a conventional phonological training in children with weak phonological awareness skills. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design and measurements across a period of 2 years, we tested the effects of two interventions: a consecutive combination of a musical and a phonological training and a phonological training alone. The design made it possible to disentangle effects of the musical training alone as well the effects of its combination with the phonological training. The outcome measures of these groups were compared with the control group with multivariate analyses, controlling for a number of background variables. The sample included N = 424 German-speaking children aged 4-5 years at the beginning of the study. We found a positive relationship between musical abilities and phonological awareness. Yet, whereas the well-established phonological training produced the expected effects, adding a musical training did not contribute significantly to phonological awareness development. Training effects were partly dependent on the initial level of phonological awareness. Possible reasons for the lack of training effects in the musical part of the combination condition as well as practical implications for early literacy education are discussed. © 2016 Kempert, Götz, Blatter, Tibken, Artelt, Schneider and Stanat.",0
Foreign accentedness revisited: Canadian and Singaporean raters’ perception of Japanese-accented English,"The current study examined how two groups of native speakers – monolingual Canadians and multilingual Singaporeans – differentially perceive foreign accentedness in spontaneous second language (L2) speech. The Singaporean raters, who had exposure to various models of English and also spoke multiple L2s on a daily basis, demonstrated more lenient accent scores than the Canadian raters, who used North American English as their primary language of communication. Both of them used a similar processing strategy to make such accentedness judgements – drawing exclusively on the phonological aspects of L2 speech without taking into account the appropriate/complex use of L2 lexicogrammar. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0
"Short-term music training enhances complex, distributed neural communication during music and linguistic tasks","Musical training is frequently associated with benefits to linguistic abilities, and recent focus has been placed on possible benefits of bilingualism to lifelong executive functions; however, the neural mechanisms for such effects are unclear. The aim of this study was to gain better understanding of the wholebrain functional effects of music and second-language training that could support such previously observed cognitive transfer effects. We conducted a 28-day longitudinal study of monolingual English-speaking 4- to 6-year-old children randomly selected to receive daily music or French language training, excluding weekends. Children completed passive EEG music note and French vowel auditory oddball detection tasks before and after training. Brain signal complexity was measured on source waveforms at multiple temporal scales as an index of neural information processing and network communication load. Comparing pretraining with posttraining, musical training was associated with increased EEG complexity at coarse temporal scales during the music and French vowel tasks in widely distributed cortical regions. Conversely, very minimal decreases in complexity at fine scales and trends toward coarse-scale increases were displayed after French training during the tasks. Spectral analysis failed to distinguish between training types and found overall theta (3.5–7.5 Hz) power increases after all training forms, with spatially fewer decreases in power at higher frequencies (>10 Hz). These findings demonstrate that musical training increased diversity of brain network states to support domain-specific music skill acquisition and music-to-language transfer effects. © 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0
Supporting Young Children's Oral Language and Writing Development: Teachers' and Early Childhood Educators' Goals and Practices,"THIS PAPER REPORTS ON interview research involving 36 primary teachers and early childhood educators from northern communities in four Canadian provinces. Interview responses show that participants support young children's oral language by creating meaningful contexts to use language for a variety of purposes. They use repetition and provide contextual information when teaching vocabulary through songs, rhymes, visuals and dramatic play. Those who teach indigenous and French Immersion students identify a need to learn more about bridging children's home and school cultures and languages. Although participants value writing as a social practice, their teaching focuses on supporting children's fine motor development and understandings about concepts about print. Given the importance of oral and written language to children's learning, our research has potential to bring needed attention to professional development needs in these two important areas. © 2016 Early Childhood Australia Inc.",0
"""the Good Start Method for English"" or how to support development, prevent and treat risk of dyslexia in children learning English as a second language","Children with developmental dyslexia and at its risk have difficulties in the acquisition of foreign languages, especially non-transparent English. The problems of such pupils concern various aspects of the language system but in particular relate to the ability to read and spell. The research literature dedicated to effective preventative methods and dyslexia treatment suggests that both children with dyslexia and at its risk need phonological awareness training and multi-sensory learning. It is also known that prevention and early treatment is more effective than therapeutic intervention used in older students. Experts in foreign language acquisition recommend that children have contact with longer oral texts and live language (e.g., poems and songs). A recently-published report on the methods of English language teaching in Polish primary schools shows that the lessons conducted there do not realise the majority of the aforementioned recommendations. As a consequence, they do not serve any pupils including those with dyslexia and at its risk. A method which meets most of the demands mentioned above is ""The Good Start Method for English"". It is a new program of teaching the English language designed for five to seven-year-olds, which at the same time ensures support for the psychomotor development of children, leading to acceleration in learning progress. © Polish Academy of Sciences, Committee for Psychological Sciences 2016.",0
Kurt Blaukopf on music sociology - an anthology: 2nd unrevised edition,"This anthology contains seven texts by Kurt Blaukopf (1914-1999) that exemplify the sociological and epistemological position of this pioneer of Austrian music sociology. Blaukopf's efforts were aimed at a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach and analysis of music as a cultural phenomenon and as social practice. The primary aim of this anthology is to make Blaukopf's work better known in the English-speaking world. It offers the interested reader a fruitful analysis of the relation between music sociology and its sister disciplines, e.g. musicology, a solid analysis in terms of the philosophy of science on the possibilities and limits of music sociology, and a highly topical discussion about the significance of intrinsic artistic aspects in music sociology. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Frankfurt am Main 2012 2nd unrevised Edition 2016.

Temporal variability in sung productions of adolescents who stutter,"Singing has long been used as a technique to enhance and reeducate temporal aspects of articulation in speech disorders. In the present study, differences in temporal structure of sung versus spoken speech were investigated in stuttering. In particular, the question was examined if singing helps to reduce VOT variability of voiceless plosives, which would indicate enhanced temporal coordination of oral and laryngeal processes. Eight German adolescents who stutter and eight typically fluent peers repeatedly spoke and sang a simple German congratulation formula in which a disyllabic target word (e.g., /'ki:ta/) was repeated five times. Every trial, the first syllable of the word was varied starting equally often with one of the three voiceless German stops /p/, /t/, /k/. Acoustic analyses showed that mean VOT and stop gap duration reduced during singing compared to speaking while mean vowel and utterance duration was prolonged in singing in both groups. Importantly, adolescents who stutter significantly reduced VOT variability (measured as the Coefficient of Variation) during sung productions compared to speaking in word-initial stressed positions while the control group showed a slight increase in VOT variability. However, in unstressed syllables, VOT variability increased in both adolescents who do and do not stutter from speech to song. In addition, vowel and utterance durational variability decreased in both groups, yet, adolescents who stutter were still more variable in utterance duration independent of the form of vocalization. These findings shed new light on how singing alters temporal structure and in particular, the coordination of laryngeal-oral timing in stuttering. Future perspectives for investigating how rhythmic aspects could aid the management of fluent speech in stuttering are discussed. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to describe (1) current perspectives on singing and its effects on articulation and fluency in stuttering and (2) acoustic parameters such as VOT variability which indicate the efficiency of control and coordination of laryngeal-oral movements. They will understand and be able to discuss (3) how singing reduces temporal variability in the productions of adolescents who do and do not stutter and 4) how this is linked to altered articulatory patterns in singing as well as to its rhythmic structure. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",0
Exaggeration of language-specific rhythms in English and French children's songs,"The available evidence indicates that the music of a culture reflects the speech rhythm of the prevailing language. The normalized pairwise variability index (nPVI) is a measure of durational contrast between successive events that can be applied to vowels in speech and to notes in music. Music-language parallels may have implications for the acquisition of language and music, but it is unclear whether native-language rhythms are reflected in children's songs. In general, children's songs exhibit greater rhythmic regularity than adults' songs, in line with their caregiving goals and frequent coordination with rhythmic movement. Accordingly, one might expect lower nPVI values (i.e., lower variability) for such songs regardless of culture. In addition to their caregiving goals, children's songs may serve an intuitive didactic function by modeling culturally relevant content and structure for music and language. One might therefore expect pronounced rhythmic parallels between children's songs and language of origin. To evaluate these predictions, we analyzed a corpus of 269 English and French songs from folk and children's music anthologies. As in prior work, nPVI values were significantly higher for English than for French children's songs. For folk songs (i.e., songs not for children), the difference in nPVI for English and French songs was small and in the expected direction but non-significant. We subsequently collected ratings from American and French monolingual and bilingual adults, who rated their familiarity with each song, how much they liked it, and whether or not they thought it was a children's song. Listeners gave higher familiarity and liking ratings to songs from their own culture, and they gave higher familiarity and preference ratings to children's songs than to other songs. Although higher child-directedness ratings were given to children's than to folk songs, French listeners drove this effect, and their ratings were uniquely predicted by nPVI. Together, these findings suggest that language-based rhythmic structures are evident in children's songs, and that listeners expect exaggerated language-based rhythms in children's songs. The implications of these findings for enculturation processes and for the acquisition of music and language are discussed. © 2016 Hannon, Lévêque, Nave and Trehub.",0
An exploration of rhythmic grouping of speech sequences by french-and german-learning infants,"Rhythm in music and speech can be characterized by a constellation of several acoustic cues. Individually, these cues have different effects on rhythmic perception: sequences of sounds alternating in duration are perceived as short-long pairs (weak-strong/iambic pattern), whereas sequences of sounds alternating in intensity or pitch are perceived as loud-soft, or high-low pairs (strong-weak/trochaic pattern). This perceptual bias—called the Iambic-Trochaic Law (ITL)–has been claimed to be an universal property of the auditory system applying in both the music and the language domains. Recent studies have shown that language experience can modulate the effects of the ITL on rhythmic perception of both speech and non-speech sequences in adults, and of non-speech sequences in 7.5-month-old infants. The goal of the present study was to explore whether language experience also modulates infants’ grouping of speech. To do so, we presented sequences of syllables to monolingual French- and German-learning 7.5-month-olds. Using the Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP), we examined whether they were able to perceive a rhythmic structure in sequences of syllables that alternated in duration, pitch, or intensity. Our findings show that both French- and German-learning infants perceived a rhythmic structure when it was cued by duration or pitch but not intensity. Our findings also show differences in how these infants use duration and pitch cues to group syllable sequences, suggesting that pitch cues were the easier ones to use. Moreover, performance did not differ across languages, failing to reveal early language effects on rhythmic perception. These results contribute to our understanding of the origin of rhythmic perception and perceptual mechanisms shared across music and speech, which may bootstrap language acquisition. © 2016 Abboub, Boll-Avetisyan, Bhatara, Höhle and Nazzi.",0
Expanding approaches to teaching for diversity and justice in K-12 education: Fostering global citizenship across the content areas,"Educators today must be able to respond to the needs of an increasingly diverse student body and to teach all students the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for civic participation in a globalized, pluralist society. While state departments of education and national teacher organizations have begun to adopt global awareness in their teaching standards and evaluation tools, there is a need for educators to understand what globally competent teachers actually do in classrooms across subject areas and grade levels. This qualitative, multiple case study explores the signature pedagogies (Shulman, 2005) of 10 in-service teachers in one southeastern state who teach for global competence in math, music, science, English, social studies, and language classes across elementary, middle, and high schools. We found three signature pedagogies that characterized globally competent teaching practices across participants: 1) intentional integration of global topics and multiple perspectives into and across the standard curriculum; 2) ongoing authentic engagement with global issues; and 3) connecting teachers’ global experiences, students’ global experiences, and the curriculum. These signature pedagogies provide visions of possibility for concrete practices teachers can adapt to infuse global citizenship education into their own contexts and for policies that school districts and teacher education programs can consider in preparing and supporting teachers in this work. © 2016, Arizona State University.

"Musical, audio-visual, poetic, and narrative input: A longitudinal case study of French-English bilingual first language acquisition","The chapter explores evidence that children treat the linguistic material in nursery rhymes, songs, stories, and children's television programmes as part of their linguistic repertoire, and readily quote it and deploy it in regular conversation. The data is taken from a longitudinal case study of the French-English bilingual first language acquisition of four siblings living in France. A set of criteria for the profiling of data examples serves to support intuitive judgements identifying items from these sources of input in the children's language production. The criteria enable the classification of four kinds of productive use of phrases from input (verbatim quote, verbatim borrowing, verbatim repetition, and adapted reuse) and three types of response to the ongoing communicative situation (response to the wording of the preceding utterance(s), response to the conversational context, response to the thematic context). The chapter includes a discussion of the way these sources of input may contribute to the process of language acquisition, language representation in the mind, and language use in interaction. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter Inc.

Effects of short-term music and second-language training on executive control,"Separate lines of research have identified enhanced performance on nonverbal executive control (EC) tasks for bilinguals and those with music training, but little is known about the relation between them in terms of the specificity of the effects of each experience or the degree of exposure necessary to induce these changes. Using an intervention design, the current study pseudorandomly assigned 57 4- to 6-year-old children (matched on age, maternal education, and cognitive scores) to a 20-day training program offering instruction in either music or conversational French. The test battery consisted of verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring EC. All children improved on these tasks following training with some training-specific differences. No changes were observed on background or working memory measures after either training, ruling out simple practice effects. Children in both groups had better scores on the most challenging condition of a grammaticality sentence judgment task in which it was necessary to ignore conflict introduced through misleading semantic content. Children in both training groups also showed better accuracy on the easier condition of a nonverbal visual search task at post-test, but children in the French training group also showed significant improvement on the more challenging condition of this task. These results are discussed in terms of emergent EC benefits of language and music training. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",0
Examples of practice: an intercultural approach to translate Romanian children’s folklore into Spanish,"Due to the great number of Romanian pupils in Spanish public school, the local administration organises extra-curricular Romanian courses in order to preserve the Romanian language and culture. This is a way to contribute to build and consolidate a bicultural and bilingual profile of the young people. Besides, it is also an opportunity to align with plurilingual and pluricultural competence established by The Common European Framework of References for Languages (2002). Based on the premise that “children's literature is an intercultural instrument”, I choose as corpus the Romanian children's folklore represented by games, formula-songs, recital-stories, household words, incantations, riddles and lullabies to translate into Spanish. After the translations, Romanian children had to find similarities and differences between the Romanian and Spanish children's songs, in order to augment the knowledge about both cultures. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0
Border studies and hemispheric studies: Rethinking America,"One of the most long-standing myths in American cultural history is the myth of the Frontier. The conflict between settlers and Indians, between “civilization” and “savagery” as well as the association of the Frontier with “empty” spaces providing unlimited opportunity and adventure was romanticized in countless dime novel Westerns and films. Frederick Jackson Turner, in his lecture on “The Significance of the Frontier in American History” in 1893, perpetuated this myth, arguing that the Frontier and Western expansion were crucially important for the creation of American values such as democracy and individualism (see Chapter 6). Especially the idea of an “empty” West had long been opposed by those population groups who had lived in the region before it was settled in the process of US-American expansionism, predominantly Mexican Americans and Native Americans. Beginning in the 1970s, scholars of Mexican and Native American history began to unearth texts and artifacts that documented the complex history and culture of the region, including the history of the 2, 000 miles long border between the United States and Mexico and the territories north and south of this border. Their critical voices were joined by those of historians and literary critics such as Patricia Limerick andAnnette Kolodny who pointed out the limitations of the Frontier myth and argued for a revised conception of the Frontier as a “meeting ground” (Limerick 269) or a space of “ongoing first encounters” (Kolodny 13) and for the necessity to incorporate the voices and perspectives marginalized by Turner. Border Studies emerged from this critical engagement with the Frontier myth and from the awareness that people living at the USMexican border - today the most densely populated border space worldwide and the site of a considerable theoretical and cultural production - are often rooted transnationally and at the intersection of different cultures, languages, ethnic, and racial groups. In his 1996 movie Lone Star, film director John Sayles presents us with a contemporary view of the border at the turn to the twenty-first century. The movie opens as two men find human bones and a weathered sheriff’s star in a dusty desert landscape. The scene is set in Frontera, Texas, a fictional border town, and the bones belong to Charlie Wade, a notoriously cruel and racist sheriff who ruled Frontera in the 1950s before he disappeared one day as did ten thousand dollars from the county funds. When Frontera’s current sheriff Sam Deeds arrives on the scene, it becomes clear that a crime needs to be solved. Although, as Kimberly Sultze (20) has pointed out, all important compo- nents for a Western are there - desert scenery, a dead man, a crime, and a sheriff willing to resolve it - something is amiss right from the start. Instead of a spectacular mythic landscape typical of classic Westerns - such as Monument Valley in a John Ford film - the camera lingers at low angle, giving us a view of cacti and shrubbery. One of the two men wears a polo shirt and shorts and reads out plant names from a book - he is a nature lover; the second man, a collector of old metals, wears headphones and a metal detector. These two unheroic figures are then joined by Sheriff Sam Deeds who does not even carry a weapon. The camera does not look up to him, presenting him as a largerthan-life figure, but rather invites the viewer to look down on him as he is shown crouching on the ground looking for pieces of evidence. Viewers also need to listen closely to what the characters are saying - another feature untypical of a classic Western where voices are usually very clear. And while in most Western movies we have only a few central characters, Sayles’s film presents us with over fifty different characters, some of whom only appear in one or two scenes. This is sometimes confusing, as we do not know immediately what the function of some of these characters and what they say for the plotline is. Moreover, the film includes many flashbacks that shed a light on episodes several decades previous to the current events, without clear cinematic signals that it is moving back in time. The element of confusion created by these cinematic strategies is of course intended, conveying a sense of the interrelations of past and present and of the complexity of Frontera’s border history. An indicator of this complexity is the Spanish name of the place, which points to the fact that the territory - Texas - used to be Mexican before its incorporation into the United States in 1845. The movie - unlike manyWesterns - presents us with a view of the town’s history that gives a voice to the people who call the border home. However, this history is not presented to us in one piece. It emerges gradually in the course of Sheriff Deeds’s investigation of the murder case and has to be assembled from information he gathers from the townspeople - little fragments of memory, hearsay, casual remarks - and old documents. In the course of the movie it becomes clear that there are a multitude of stories in Frontera. But not all of these stories are equally accepted. Some linger unexplored and invisible beneath the “offcial” version of Frontera’s history, some are present only as rumors, some are publicly denied. The movie unravels Frontera’s history on several levels, as characters in the movie explore the history of the town or their own history and that of their parents. The image that emerges sheds a light not only on the events surrounding the death of Charlie Wade, but also on the many boundaries that fracture the community of this town - boundaries of “race, "" class, language, and historical perspective. In a scene at the beginning of the film, high school teachers and parents are engaged in a heated discussion about which version of history is to be taught to the children and how far the textbook version should be followed. Some of the parents and teachers are Anglo-Americans, but at least half of them are of Mexican American descent. While some parents argue that the winners of history should decide about this, and that the textbook version should be taught because it reflects the “winners’"" viewpoint, others point out that the majority of inhabitants of Frontera are Mexican Americans, Blacks, and Native Americans and that their children have a right to learn about alternative versions. While one Anglo teacher thinks that the tolerance for difference should only apply to food and music, another suggests that it is important to present a more inclusive picture. What becomes clear in this scene as in the entire film is that the issues at stake at the border are centrally issues that are also at stake in the nation - or, as Chicano critic José David Saldívar put it in a seminal book in 1997, that “border matters” for the nation. Critically interrogating traditional narratives of “American” identity and national paradigms of culture that proclaim a monocultural and monolithic version of history, and that have regarded the border region as peripheral and negligible, Saldívar argues that the transnational culture of the borderlands constitutes a social space in which new imaginaries, hybrid cultures, and theoretical productions emerge. In Lone Star, Texas operates for Sayles as a microcosm of America, as he himself has stated: “One of the reasons I chose Texas for this thing is because the state of Texas has a compressed history that is like a metaphor for the history of the United States” (Smith 232). One of the plotlines in Lone Star circles around sheriff Deeds’s father, the legendary Buddy Deeds who replaced Charlie Wade as sheriff after Wade’s disappearance. Offcial town lore still presents Buddy Deeds as a hero and benefactor of the town. After the remains of Charlie Wade have been found, Buddy Deeds becomes a prime suspect as he had opposed Wade early on. Most of Frontera’s citizens do not want to believe he is a murderer, unlike his son Sam who has resented his father ever since he broke up Sam’s high school love relationship with a Mexican American girl, Pilar. Sam, who left town as a young man and has only recently returned to Frontera, becomes the main driving force in trying to uncover the mystery about Charlie Wade’s disappearance. He assumes his father to have been a racist like his predecessor, but after listening to the stories told him by different people in town, he needs to revise his image of his father. As it turns out, Buddy Deeds was not the murderer of Charlie Wade, and he was respected in town because, while he used politics to foster his own personal interests and that of his friends, these friends were Black, Anglo, and Mexican Americans alike. It is significant how borders are presented in the movie. While some pro- tagonists (like former Sheriff Charlie Wade) try to keep borders clear and definite - especially those that demarcate “race” and class hierarchies - the unraveling plot makes clear that these borders have always been permeable, if only unoffcially. This becomes visible in the plotline that concerns the story of Sam’s high school girlfriend Pilar and her parents, Mercedes Cruz and her husband Eladio who was killed by Charlie Wade while trying to bring Mexican friends of his across the border. While Pilar, now a teacher at the local high school, tries to convey to her students a more accurate version of history than the textbook presents, her mother Mercedes, a successful local businesswoman, advocates an assimilationist stance, prohibiting her employees from speaking Spanish at work and calling the police when she sees people trying to cross the Rio Grande from Mexico to the United States. In a later flashback however, it becomes clear that Mercedes herself came to the United States as an undocumented immigrant and that she is denying her own history. Moreover, as it turns out, she was conducting an affair with Sam’s father Buddy Deeds after her husband’s death, and Pilar is actually not Eladio’s daughter, but Buddy Deeds’s, and thus Sam Deeds’s half-sister. This detail is found out by Sam after he has resumed his romantic relationship with Pilar and as he investigates the murder case. In one scene Sam crosses the border into Mexico to question a former friend of Eladio Cruz, a local tire dealer in Ciudad León. As the tire dealer makes clear to him, for many Mexican Americans the border at the time of Charlie Wade’s rule was just a “line in the dust, "" an arbitrary boundary drawn by those in power after the occupation of Mexico in 1848. In his narrative, Eladio Cruz died because he was “giving some friends of his a lift in his camión one day - but because he’s on one side of this invisible line and not the other, they got to hide in the back like criminals.” For Charlie Wade, Eladio Cruz was committing a transgression, and the ensuing violence indicates the power hierarchies in place at that border. John Sayles’s Lone Star was a commercial success and an Oscar nominee (for best screenplay). This is quite remarkable if we consider how provocative the movie is not only in its revision of border history, but even more in its depiction of an incestuous relationship that takes the issue of borders and border-crossing on yet a different level. After Sam has told Pilar what he has found out - that they are siblings - they decide to ignore the incest taboo and stay together. As Kim Magowan has convincingly argued, “Sayles combines incest, society’s most ubiquitous taboo, with miscegenation in ways that simultaneously nod to cultural tradition and break from it” (20). Interracial relationships for a long time in American history were outlawed and yet practiced, especially in the American South by slave owners who sexually exploited their female “property.” While Sayles moves the scene from the binary racial setting of the slavery South to the realm of the Texas border region, it becomes clear that the taboo of racial mixture played an important role in the history of Frontera, even if it was often transgressed. Interracial relationships are a frequent phenomenon in the Frontera community, generating much of its population. If the miscegenation taboo has been ignored, Sayles seems to argue, it might be possible to choose to ignore the incest taboo, too. Since both taboos are cultural constructions they are both negotiable (Magowan 22). As we can see in this reading of the movie, the concept of the border refers not only to a geographical location but is also used metaphorically to interrogate boundaries between culturally constructed categories such as “race” or ethnicity. An author who has famously addressed constructions of gender and sexuality as well as spirituality in her use of the term “border” is Chicana writer Gloria Anzaldúa. © 2016 Antj Dallmann, Eva Boesenberg and Martin Klepper.",0
"The use of anglicisms in Spanish television commercials of cosmetics, hygiene and personal care products","This paper analyses the use of English in Spanish television commercials, since no scientifi c studies have been carried out so far in this fi eld. Although there are a few similar studies of print media, our review of the literature has shown some gaps in the research on Anglicisms used in advertising. English seems to be widely present in television commercials in Spain for different reasons. Marketing and cost-saving strategies of multinational companies together with the prestige of the English language and Anglo-American culture in Spain are some of the primary causes. In our study, we have focused on a corpus of pure Anglicisms (English words which have not been adapted to Spanish) and pseudo-Anglicisms (terms that do not exist in English, though they are similar to English words), found in commercials related to cosmetics, hygiene and personal care products, as part of the research project ""Globalisation and Impact of the Anglo-American Culture on Spain"". Five hundred and thirty one commercials of the three main private national television channels in Spain (Tele5, Antena3, LaSexta) and children's Disney Channel (Spain) were compiled in 2013. The results confi rm a considerable presence of pure Anglicisms, English-Spanish code switching, pseudo-Anglicisms and Anglo-American imagery and music in the advertising of products related to cosmetics, hygiene and personal care on Spanish television. Consequently, the link of these products to the prestige of the English-speaking world is reinforced.",0
‘Don’t waste the waste’: Dumpster dinners among garbage gourmands,"On a Wednesday night in May 2012, Janet, a 45-year-old high school Spanish teacher, and Jonathan, a 25-year-old self-described anarchist and fulltime activist, are washing and cutting courgettes in the kitchen of a cosy apartment in Queens, New York. As they work, they chat amicably about how best to prepare the vegetable stir fry and debate over whether the meal should be vegan. Around them, ten other people are helping with the preparation. This scene is reminiscent of the classic American potluck, where each participant brings a dish to share or ingredients to prepare with the others, except for one key difference: the night before, all of the food being prepared had been at the bottom of 50-litre dark plastic trash bags, placed on the pavement and destined for the landﬁll. This meal started where other meals usually end: disposal. Janet and Jonathan are part of a group of ‘freegans’ in New York City. Freegans are people who adopt the practice of eating from the garbage as part of a ‘total boycott’ of an economic system they see as wasteful, exploitative, and unsustainable.1 They call this Wednesday night’s event a ‘freegan feast’: a meal where all the ingredients – except for some spices and cooking oil – have been ‘dumpster-dived’ outside of commercial establishments. Although dumpster-diving for food, clothing, or other household items has a long history as a survival strategy for the poor and marginalised, an increasing number of groups and individuals around the Western world use voluntary waste recovery as a form of political action (see Nguyen, Chen, & Mukherjee, 2014; Barnard, 2011; Gross, 2009; Edwards & Mercer, 2007). Across the Atlantic in the summer of 2013, Adrien and Marine, a haphazardly dressed and eccentric-looking young couple sharing an apartment in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, have also organised a free meal in their community garden. Marine is a part-time French tutor, while Adrien works – ironically enough – for a gastronomic guidebook. He puts his knowledge of French culinary culture to good use, preparing a barbecue that brings together a diverse group from the neighbourhood around food that has been almost entirely rescued from the trash. The pair have been dumpster-diving for fouryears and, as they stated on an advertisement posted in March 2013 for a room in their shared apartment, ‘Nine-tenths of our food comes from rescue!’2 They represent a growing trend of dumpster-divers who recover waste for reasons that vary from sustainability to amusement or thrift, particularly in response to the economic downturn in 2008 (Guillard & Roux, 2014; Brosius, Fernandez, & Cherrier, 2013; Carolsfeld & Erikson, 2013; Fernandez, Brittain, & Bennett, 2011; see also Cappellini, Marilli, & Parsons, Chapter 4). Drawing on practice theories, which underline the importance of the material dimensions of everyday life (Røpke, 2009; Shove, Trentmann, & Wilk, 2009; Warde, 2005), we show how certain objects – such as discarded food – can reshape human action in surprising ways. By analysing dumpsterdived meals as a ‘compound practice’ (Warde, 2013), breaking it down into the ‘sub-practices’ or acquiring, preparing, eating, and disposing of discarded food, we reveal the contradictions between the political and ethical meanings and the ‘doings’ (Magaudda, 2011) of this practice (see Canniford & Bradshaw, Chapter 17). As we ﬁnd, ‘dumpster dinners’, free from the usual economic pressures of purchasing food, are still shaped by different cultural and social rules about how foods should be separated or combined, peeled or not-peeled, discarded or preserved. These expectations and habits at times block dumpster-divers from realising their purported commitments to reduce waste. These tensions are invisible in existing studies of dumpster-diving as a form of ethical consumption which focuses primarily, or solely, on the acquisition of wasted goods and not their subsequent trajectory (Guillard & Roux, 2014; Carolsfeld & Erikson, 2013; Edwards & Mercer, 2007; see also Närvänen, Mesiranta, & Hukkanen, Chapter 15). At a time when various public policies and activist movements aim to encourage ethical or sustainable consumption, analyses such as this are vital for showing how such changes must focus on complete systems of practices – whether from acquisition to disposal or disposal to consumption – and the way they interact with and constrain one another. We base our analysis on ethnographic observations of the activist network freegan.info in New York City from 2007 to 2012 and of Disco Soupe – a movement founded in 2012 that organises public cooking events that use discarded ingredients in order to ‘raise awareness’ on food waste in a musical and ‘festive’ atmosphere3 – in Paris from 2013 to 2014. In addition to our participation in these groups, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 dumpster-divers in the US and nine in France. These data are complemented by ongoing, embodied participation in dumpster-diving by both authors between 2009 and 2014. © 2016 Benedetta Cappellini, David Marshall and Elizabeth Parsons.

Language and folklore of ethnic Tuvans in Mongolia in Tuvan electronic databases,"Dialects of Tuvan language outside Tuva have reached a critical point, with the number of their elderly speakers plummeting and those from the younger generations facing problems due to language policies in the countries they live in. For ethnic Tuvans in Mongolia, this is a topical issue as well. In this article, we attempted to systematize the linguistic heritage of Mongolian Tuvans in order to prepare it for integration into the existing electronic corpora of Tuvan language. As the language spoken by Mongolian Tuvans is a dialect, there is no need for a separate project for it. A large contribution to studying the language and culture of Mongolian Tuvans has been made by the German scholar E. Taube. The heritage of Mongolian Tuvans is a mix of published and unpublished pieces in various genres performed by a number of prominent narrators. It is also paramount to include into the collection the works of Mongolia's best-known Tuvan writer Chinagiyn Galsan, Honored Writer of Tuva, laureate of a number of high-profile literary and public awards in Germany. Also of high importance are the works of Puntsag Dariyn, diplomat and author of a Tuvan-Spanish-English dictionary (2013). A special place in the electronic databases should belong to dialect materials as they appear in daily broadcasts in Tuvan on state TV channel Mongolia 2; in publications by researchers at Tuva Institute for the Humanities (with G. Zolbayar as a participant); Tuvan textbooks compiled by the teachers at Tsengel Tuvan primary school; archives of the ethnolinguistic expeditions made by the department of Tuvan philology and general linguistics at Tuvan State University since the 1990s. Another recommended addition to the dialect corpus is ""The Dictionary of Altai Dialect of Tuvan Language"" - a collaborative project by scholars at Tuvan State University and their Mongolian Tuvan postgraduate students. The multimedia corpus might also include audio and video recordings made by scholars from TuvSU during their expeditions. A special focus should be made on the song 'Men Tyva Men' (I am Tuvan) written by Tsengel Tuvans Bayan-Sagaan Ookei and later reworked by Tuvan musicians and singers into the national anthem of the Republic of Tuva (2011). © 2016 New Reaearch of Tuva.

"Salâh birsel's ""şingir mingir"" words -idioms","Vocabulary, in general meaning, means all of the words in a language. In special meaning, it means all of the words that an individual knows. Expand of a language's vocabulary depends on its being used in science, art and philosophy. For this reason scholars, poets and writers are pioneers of people who develop the narrative possibilities of a language. The primary way of improving the personal vocabulary is reading. The statement by German philosopher Wittgenstein ""The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."" expresses clearly the importance of vocabulary and personal vocabulary. This article focuses on the 30 idioms that Salâh Birsel brought into Turkish vocabulary by his book named Boğaziçi Şingir Mingir. This book is one of the 100 Basic Worksrecommended by the Ministry of Education for high school students. It is a text displaying the author's (Birsel) language ability by numerous examples. He has many characteristics as an essayist, poet, and special historian. But one of his titles is the language worker. In this study, the documentary screening method is used. The idioms which have been determined by this method from the book show how the writer is successful about bringing in new words and idioms to Turkish vocabulary by using different technics like derivation, composition, and collection.",0

The contribution of classical music given outdoor to improve Indonesian high school students' ability in descriptive text writing,"Some students find it difficult to write in English since they have to find the right vocabulary, use the correct grammar, and state their opinions and others. Therefore, the researchers tried to observe the effectiveness of Classical Music Given Outdoor (CMGO). The objectives of the study are: (1) to determine whether there is significant difference in producing descriptive text between students who are taught using CMGO and those who are taught using traditional method, (2) to find out how well CMGO gives contribution to students' ability in descriptive text writing. It was an experimental research with 205 students of six Senior High Schools in Semarang city, Central Java, Indonesia. The participants were divided into the experimental and control groups. The data were collected by the test, journal and observation. The result of the research showed that the application of CMGO actually gave contribution in improving students' skills to produce descriptive texts. The posttest mean of the experimental group was higher (from 60.27 to 65.20) than the control group (from 60.86 to 62.31). The t-value for two posttest means was 1.982 and the critical value at α = 5 % was 1.97. It means that there was a significant difference of students' skills in producing descriptive text between experimental group and control group. Furthermore, the students' journals and the teachers' observation showed that the experimental groups were more excited than the control groups.",0

Analysis of the uses of languages (indigenous and non-indigenous) among Toba/Qom and Mbýa children from Argentina drawing on experience at play,"In view of their bilingualism, these communities adopt specific strategies to everyday language use. This paper addresses the development of communication skills in less dominant languages in bilingual children from Argentina's indigenous communities (Toba/Qom and Mbyá). In particular, we set out to emphasize how certain recreational practices have impacted on use of less dominant languages among children in these groups (Toba/Qom in the first case, and Spanish in the second). The article is organized into five sections. It begins with a brief contextualization of the sociolinguistic situation of the languages spoken in the empirical referents analysed, to facilitate understanding of the importance and singularity of the case studies presented. We go on to develop the methodology supporting our research and finally consider the selected theoretical framework regarding the anthropology of childhood, while revisiting a number of anthropological contributions to studies on play and language. We also refer to the Toba/Qom and Mbyá definitions of childhood and analyse games and language use among children.",0
Issue in bilingualism: English-Chinese code-switching past and present,"Code-switching (CS) is a common linguistic phenomenon found in almost any bilingual or multilingual community. This phenomenon means alternation between two or more sets of linguistic codes in a person's utterance during a conversation. Such alternation is not only found in adults' talk but also among conversations of young children. In the past, many studies on CS had strong reservations over this phenomenon as some researchers viewed it as a manifestation of his incompetence or fusion in the two languages. This is still perceived by some language purists and language educators today (Goh and Zhao. CS in the classroom: A taboo norm. SingTeach, Issue 9. http://?singteach.?nie.?edu.?sg/?issue09-ideas01/?, 2007). On the other hand, CS is viewed positively by other researchers (Poplack, Linguistics 18:581 618, 1980; Genesee et al. Talking with strangers: A study of bilingual children's communicative competence. Applied Psycholinguistics, 17(4), 427-442, 1996, Genesee. Bilingual first language acquisition: Exploring the limits of the language faculty. In M. McGroarty (Ed.), 21st annual review of applied linguistics (pp. 153-168). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001). They have shown that CS consistently adheres to certain linguistic patterns and this means that CS is not a result of confusion or incompetence. Moreover, some research has revealed that children used CS for various communicative purposes, like showing intimacy to interlocutors or differentiating interlocutors, who speak different languages, etc. (Al-Khatib 2003; Genesee 1993, 2002; (Genesee et al.

Development and main topics of psychological giftedness research: A scientometric study of publications between 1980 and 2014,"This study presents quantitative scientometric results on the development and main focus of publications on giftedness in the fields of psychology from German-speaking countries (PSYNDEX) and Anglo-American countries (PsycINFO) published between 1980 and 2014. In comparison with the literature on mental retardation/intellectual developmental disorders, the quantity of publications on giftedness (PSYNDEX: 1,066; PsycINFO: 8,572) amounts to one fifth. Both databases show a peak of publications in the 1980s and, again, a steady increase in publication numbers since the year 2000. For PSYNDEX, 38% of the publications refer to empirical studies with the quantity being rather stable since 2000. By contrast, 54% of the PsycINFO publications refer to empirical studies on giftedness and their number shows a steady increase since 2000. Approximately 80% of all publications refer to giftedness in school age (6-17 years old), while preschool age and adulthood are rarely studied. Publications focus mainly on giftedness in general cognitive, scholastic, mathematical, athletic, and musical ability while creative, verbal, nonverbal, or figural-spatial abilities are rarely studied. The implications of the results for research on giftedness are discussed. © 2016 Hogrefe Verlag.",0
The Impact of Sexual Media on Second Language Vocabulary Retrieval,"Both Islam and Christianity warn their adherents not to view or to display obscene matter. Aside from religious consequences in the afterlife for such behavior, this study was conducted to determine if viewing sexual media has a detrimental effect in earthly life. Adolescents (n = 64) 17–22 years were exposed to two types of visual stimuli containing sexual or neutral content for 30 min. The participants, seated in rooms with comfortable chairs and provided with snacks, were shown a selection of 18 German words via a PowerPoint slideshow, which included a picture, an audio recording, and the written form of each word. The experimental group, which was exposed to arousing visual stimuli with mild sexual content (movie trailers, music video clips, and TV commercials), remembered significantly fewer words than the control group, which viewed a nature documentary without sexual content. T-test scores revealed that exposure to sexually arousing media impaired memory for second language (L2) vocabulary. Apart from leading to dire consequences in the hereafter, the results of the study demonstrate that viewing obscene material also causes harm in this life. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0
Investigating vocabulary teaching modules for preschoolers: The first phase of a design experiment,"Extensive research is being done to look into low literacy levels in English among Malaysian students. It has been reported that one of the reasons Malaysian learners have low English literacy skills is due to them having limited vocabulary (Normazidah Che Musa, Lie, & Azman, 2012) which should be addressed as early as during their early childhood years. Research shows that there are many ways to incorporate this in early childhood lessons including through song, show-and-tell and spelling (SSTS). However, to date, there have been very few studies conducted to see how these tools are being incorporated in Malaysian preschools. Hence, this study aims to investigate the problems faced by preschool teachers in implementing these three tools in their lessons, and the children's feedback towards the learning approach. The findings of this study reveal that the teachers find the effort to integrate the tools time consuming, while the children find it hard to stay focused on the lesson. It is suggested that the three vocabulary instruction tools be integrated through animation video. © Peter Lang AG, International Academic Publishers, Bern 2016. All rights reserved.

EFL oral communication teaching practices: A close look at university teachers and A2 students’ perspectives in Thailand and a critical eye from Serbia,"This paper aimed to reexamine current EFL oral communication teaching practices from the perspectives of teachers and A2 students at two universities, namely Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Thailand and University of Novi Sad (UNS), Serbia. The main objectives were: (1) to analyze current practices from the perspectives of teachers and students, (2) to identify real problems encountered by teachers and students attempting to embrace Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) to improve oral English communication, and (3) propose practical solutions for classroom practices to improve the majority of students’ oral proficiency from the elementary level.     The findings were that oral English communication classes at PSU continue to embrace CLT and that the majority of Thai A2 students were frequently engaged in group activities rather than in individual and teacher-centered tasks. There was reliance on unrealistic, scripted role plays. Unlike the Serbian students, Thai students apparently needed to acquire more independent skills, become less passive learners, and interact more spontaneously in the target language. Other problems at PSU included mixed ability classes. Recommendations are placement tests, choices of more advanced elective courses, rigorous enforcement of upper enrollment limit, a balance between group and individual communicative tasks, and replacement of scripted with non-scripted role plays. © 2014, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

"Multimedia in learning english as a foreign language as preferred by German, Spanish, and Spanish teenagers","This paper presents the findings of a small-scale study investigating the preferences of German, Spanish, and Spanish teenage English as a foreign language (EFL) learners concerning their use of multimedia, such as Skype, Facebook, YouTube, e-mails, and TV-programmes in learning English. A group of 88 respondents was requested to complete an on-line questionnaire in order to specify how often some selected types of multimedia are used by adolescents in their autonomous EFL learning, and to determine their views on the extent to which some selected multimedia affect the development of their language skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) and their English pronunciation. The outcomes confirm culture-specific preferences and provide some interesting insights into adolescents’ favourable tools for autonomous EFL learning which are invaluable for language teachers, researchers, and course designers. The results also show that the respondents view watching films and listening to music as very influential in improving their listening skills. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0
The issue of Kaaps: Afrikaans teaching at school needs a more inclusive approach,"The universal context that this paper builds on relates to the theme of language as a form of cultural identity and the role it plays in education. The question that guides this research, is whether one variety of the Afrikaans language - referred to as Kaaps1 - is owned by its speakers in such a way that it not only underpins the individual and collective identities of those Afrikaans-speaking people classified as Coloured2 and marginalised by poverty, location and race, but it could also contribute to the successful delivery of the school curriculum in those schools attended mainly by the Coloured population. A socio-historical perspective on the history of the Kaaps language since the early 1600s is reflected in a literature review, providing a backdrop to the current status of Kaaps among the coloured community; its rivalry with standard Afrikaans; the influence of Kaaps on its speakers' perception of their own identity; whether the CAPS3 makes provision for the teaching of Kaaps, and if so to what extent the language is used in South African schools. From the earliest days of South African history political decisions were taken to ensure that White and Coloured and Black people lived apart from one another. The racial label ""Coloured"" inflicted deep wounds and created a lot of bitterness. Because Coloureds in the Cape lived apart from their fellow Afrikaans speakers for such a long time, the respective language communities also grew further apart: Kaaps eventually developed alongside Standard Afrikaans. The earliest manifestations of Kaaps were recorded before Jan van Riebeeck set foot at the Cape on behalf of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1652. At a time when most Afrikaners in Cape Town were becoming anglicised, Muslims played a large role in developing Kaaps. Despite the Dutch origins and lyrics of Cape Muslim music, this cultural contribution was never acknowledged and very little of it was documented. The logical deduction following from these observations is that the ""Coloured voice"" simply could not be part of the canon of Afrikaans literature, because the Afrikaans spoken by most Coloured people (Kaaps) was regarded as a deviation from Standard Afrikaans. Most Coloured scholars are of the opinion that Standard Afrikaans does not represent the total language community of Afrikaans speakers. Yet the process of standardisation continued to deny the creole nature of Afrikaans, and the language was purified by the elimination of Khoi, Malay and slave influences. Another point of concern is that Kaaps is often disparagingly referred to as a joke language, thus conveying a stigma around the language. For many white speakers of Afrikaans the standard version of the language is part of their identity and defines who and what they are. It is no different for Coloured speakers of Afrikaans, but they are less outspoken about it. Against this background, the place of Coloured poets and writers who wrote in Afrikaans has always been controversial. After 1994 schools were no longer separated and today integrated schools are a common phenomenon. But the legacy of apartheid education is still evident, for example, in the level of literacy in the Coloured and Black communities, which is much lower than that in the White communities. This is the result of years of non-development of language proficiency among Coloured people, because Kaaps was dismissed as sub-standard. This led to bitterness because children who grew up with Kaaps had to learn in Standard Afrikaans and the prescribed textbooks portrayed a different world to the one in which they lived. A core aspect in the delivery of the curriculum is how knowledge is conveyed and constructed. Hence, several attempts were made to advance the recognition of Kaaps because the role of language is critically important in the successful delivery of the curriculum. Before learners can master a subject, they first need to overcome the barrier of the language of instruction. The result is that learners who speak Kaaps under-achieve in the national assessment tests because they are assessed in Standard Afrikaans. It should also be determined whether or not the new CAPS curriculum allows for Kaaps to be taught at school. According to the CAPS (DoBE 2012:4) the curriculum is an all inclusive document that guarantees learners the right to knowledge, skills and values irrespective of their socioeconomic background. At the same time schools must be sensitive to issues such as diversity, language and race. The whole approach of CAPS is based on social transformation and human rights whilst teaching learners to appreciate our indigenous knowledge systems. Within this context it is clear that there is nothing that prohibits schools from acknowledging Kaaps in the curriculum. It is widely recognized that learning through the mother tongue is the most effective form of learning with the best results (Alexander 1997, Heugh 2006). If this is true for English, Afrikaans, isiXhosa and all the other indigenous languages, the same argument holds true for Kaaps. It is against this background that this study calls for a better representation of Kaaps in the school curriculum. © Sabinet 2016.",0
"Motivation to study music in Australian schools: The impact of music learning, gender, and socio-economic status","This study extends an eight-country mapping exercise (McPherson & O'Neill, 2010; see Research Studies in Music Education issues 2010-2011) to include students' motivation to study music within the Australian context. It sought to determine whether music learners (students learning an instrument or voice), might be more motivated to study academic subjects at school, and whether gender and socio-economic status (SES) affected student motivation to learn music at school. A total of 2,727 students from grades 5 to 12 completed a questionnaire based on Eccles and Wigfield's expectancy-value framework. Data collected included: ratings of competence beliefs, interest, importance, usefulness and difficulty for music, English, maths, and science; indications of whether the students were currently learning a musical instrument or voice (music learners); and whether they would like to if given the opportunity. There was an overall significant decline in competence beliefs, interest, importance, and usefulness across the school years, in contrast with increased task difficulty ratings across the school years. Music learners reported significantly higher competence beliefs, interest, importance, usefulness, and less task difficulty than non-music learners. This advantage applied across all school grades for music, competence beliefs for English in upper primary and lower secondary school grades, and for maths in lower secondary grades. Although females reported music as more important and useful than males, their competence beliefs and task difficulty ratings were equivalent. Music was considered slightly less interesting for females than for males. The value of music as a subject declined significantly for upper SES students from upper primary to lower secondary schools. The greatest number of participants (40.8%) who expressed a desire to learn a musical instrument came from the lower SES category in upper primary school. This is an important result in the Australian context, indicating that this may be a positive time to recruit learners. This study provides new information regarding the relationship between motivation and desire to learn a musical instrument across school grades, gender, and socio-economic factors. © SEMPRE.",0
A hypothesis on improving foreign accents by optimizing variability in vocal learning brain circuits,"Rapid vocal motor learning is observed when acquiring a language in early childhood, or learning to speak another language later in life. Accurate pronunciation is one of the hardest things for late learners to master and they are almost always left with a non-native accent. Here, I propose a novel hypothesis that this accent could be improved by optimizing variability in vocal learning brain circuits during learning. Much of the neurobiology of human vocal motor learning has been inferred from studies on songbirds. Jarvis (2004) proposed the hypothesis that as in songbirds there are two pathways in humans: one for learning speech (the striatal vocal learning pathway), and one for production of previously learnt speech (the motor pathway). Learning new motor sequences necessary for accurate non-native pronunciation is challenging and I argue that in late learners of a foreign language the vocal learning pathway becomes inactive prematurely. The motor pathway is engaged once again and learners maintain their original native motor patterns for producing speech, resulting in speaking with a foreign accent. Further, I argue that variability in neural activity within vocal motor circuitry generates vocal variability that supports accurate non-native pronunciation. Recent theoretical and experimental work on motor learning suggests that variability in the motor movement is necessary for the development of expertise. I propose that there is little trial-by-trial variability when using the motor pathway. When using the vocal learning pathway variability gradually increases, reflecting an exploratory phase in which learners try out different ways of pronouncing words, before decreasing and stabilizing once the “best” performance has been identified. The hypothesis proposed here could be tested using behavioral interventions that optimize variability and engage the vocal learning pathway for longer, with the prediction that this would allow learners to develop new motor patterns that result in more native-like pronunciation. © 2015 Simmonds.",0
Leadership education for English language learners as transformative pedagogy,"This qualitative case study investigates the transformative power of a leadership course designed for immigrant secondary school students learning English as an additional language with a social justice orientation. Course projects allowed the students to get involved in tutoring, present at a conference on intercultural education, deliver equity presentations and role model presentation skills for their peers by discussing topics such as Canadian culture, showcase their talents from their L1 cultures and give advice on how to integrate into the school and to lead activities to create school spirit by sharing music from their culture, running a ‘thank your teacher’ campaign, or taking the lead with an international humanitarian cause. The teacher’s plans and notes, course assignments, video footage of students presenting a conference workshop and monthly feedback forms were the data that allowed us to understand how transformative pedagogy was enacted by the teacher and experienced by the students in one Canadian secondary school with a very diverse student population. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",0
Brecht for children: Shaping the ideal GDR citizen through opera education,"East German music educators developed new children's operas on the model of Brechtian Lehrstücke to teach critical, ""dialectical"" thinking, a skill they considered essential for young socialists. This essay examines how the operas offered an alternative political education to the GDR's official program of state-loyal patriotism and explores the conflicts that arose when Brecht's theories of gestus and estrangement came into contact with the fairy tale tradition long thought to be the center of German children's culture.

"Characteristic tonality in the balletti of Gastoldi, Morley, and Hassler","In 1595 Thomas Morley published The First Booke of Balletts, a collection of ""Italian madrigals Englished."" Rather than writing English words for unaltered Italian works as his predecessors had done, Morley created original compositions loosely modeled on Italian works. Analysis of Morley's balletts reveals four primary ""Englishing"" techniques. First, Morley establishes and confirms tonic more thoroughly than the Italians do. Second, the dominant chord plays a larger role in Morley's balletts, often yielding predictive statement-response phrase structures. Third, Morley uses pre-dominant chords at cadences (yielding tonic-pre-dominant-dominant-tonic syntax) more regularly than his models do. Finally, in the rare instances that he chooses models without periodic phrase structure, Morley introduces periodicity. Morley's recompositions contribute to the tonal sound that, historically, scholars have identified with the English madrigal. To situate this repertoire in relation to repertoires we more commonly identify as tonal, this article introduces the notion of characteristic tonality, an inclusive concept that provides a vocabulary for analyzing and distinguishing among repertoires with tonal features. To demonstrate the utility of characteristic tonality, the article concludes by comparing the tonal language of German-texted balletts by Hans Leo Hassler with those of Morley and his Italian models. These three repertoires manifest tonal characteristics in richly multifaceted ways; points of contact between them provide insight into precise agents of musical change around the turn of the seventeenth century. © 2015 by Yale University.",0
Tone-language speakers show hemispheric specialization and differential cortical processing of contour and interval cues for pitch,"Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that the neural coding of pitch is modulated by language experience and the linguistic relevance of the auditory input; both rightward and leftward asymmetries have been observed in the hemispheric specialization for pitch. In music, pitch is encoded using two primary features: contour (patterns of rises and falls) and interval (frequency separation between tones) cues. Recent evoked potential studies demonstrate that these ""global"" (contour) and ""local"" (interval) aspects of pitch are processed automatically (but bilaterally) in trained musicians. Here, we examined whether alternate forms of pitch expertise, namely, tone-language experience (i.e., Chinese), influence the early detection of contour and intervallic deviations within ongoing pitch sequences. Neuroelectric mismatch negativity (MMN) potentials were recorded in Chinese speakers and English-speaking nonmusicians in response to continuous pitch sequences with occasional global or local deviations in the ongoing melodic stream. This paradigm allowed us to explore potential cross-language differences in the hemispheric weighting for contour and interval processing of pitch. Chinese speakers showed differential pitch encoding between hemispheres not observed in English listeners; Chinese MMNs revealed a rightward bias for contour processing but a leftward hemispheric laterality for interval processing. In contrast, no asymmetries were observed in the English group. Collectively, our findings suggest tone-language experience sensitizes auditory brain mechanisms for the detection of subtle global/local pitch changes in the ongoing auditory stream and exaggerates functional asymmetries in pitch processing between cerebral hemispheres. © 2015 IBRO.",0
"MARGUERITE de VALOIS, REINE de NAVARRE (1553-1615): PATRONESS and PERFORMER","This essay studies the role played by Marguerite de Valois in the cultural life of the French court from early childhood until her death in 1615. Trained to perform in public, Marguerite acquired languages and diplomatic skills, and cultivated music and dancing in particular. Her passion for dancing and the energy and mastery she displayed in performance is traced through the testimony of contemporary records (French, Italian and English), through her own recollections, and through a discussion of her patronage of musicians, poets and dancers. © © Cambridge University Press 2015.",0
The efficacy of singing in foreign-language learning,"This study extends the popular notion that memory for text can be supported by song to foreign-language learning. Singing can be intrinsically motivating, attention focusing, and simply enjoyable for learners of all ages. The melodic and rhythmic context of song enhances recall of native text; however, there is limited evidence that these benefits extend to foreign text. In this study, Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian children learned a novel English passage for 2 weeks. Children in a sung condition learned the passage as a song and children in the spoken condition learned the passage as an oral poem. Children were tested on their ability to recall the passage verbatim, pronounce English vowel sounds, and translate target terms from English to Spanish. As predicted, children in the sung condition outperformed children in the spoken condition in all three domains. The song advantage persevered after a 6-month delay. Findings have important implications for foreign language instruction. © Society for Education, Music, and Psychology Research.",1
A situational analysis of persons with disabilities in jamaica and trinidad and tobago: Education and employment policy imperatives,"Jamaica and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago are independent English Speaking Caribbean countries, known as birthplaces for reggae and calypso music, the world's fastest man Usain Bolt, and the Steel Pan. Both are accorded the status of countries of high human development in terms of life expectancy, educational attainment and income by the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Report (2014). The post-independence development strides of both countries however have not equitably improved the socio-economic conditions of persons with disabilities compared to their counterparts without disabilities. Quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed using primary and secondary data analyses to unearth the distinct socio-economic vulnerabilities faced by working-age persons with disability for whom the right to development remains marginally realized. The main barriers that bolster exclusion and cyclical poverty traps for persons with disabilities are distilled through an examination of the socio-cultural environment, education and training, and employment. Recommendations are forwarded to inform practical legislative, policy and program development in the twenty-first century for the Caribbean. The recommendations provide a critical framework to advance the enforcement of the national disability policies in existence and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.

"Afrikaners is Plesierig! Voëlvry Music, Anti-apartheid Identities and Rockey Street Nightclubs in Yeoville (Johannesburg), 1980s–90s","In the 1980s, Afrikaans-speaking young South Africans increasingly disassociated themselves from the dominant institutions, i.e., the Calvinist church, the state and the parental generation. Their oppositional ideas could be partly conveyed through Voëlvry, rock-punkish music at the time labelled ‘Boerepunk’ and ‘Alternative Afrikaans Music Movement’, which lasted for a short span of time, between the 1980s and the early 1990s. Voëlvry contributed to some extent to changing the widespread images of Afrikaners as inherently conformist. Drawing on novel oral sources, newspapers and secondary literature, this article argues that Yeoville (Johannesburg) – Rockey Street in particular – as a space of cross-cultural interaction facilitated the expression and popularisation of anti-apartheid identities through music. Two popular nightclubs on Rockey Street were Rumours, a jazz club started in 1979, and the Black Sun. Rumours became the central meeting place for the Anglophone Yeoville residents and habitués, while the Afrikaans-speaking Voëlvry fans rotated around the latter. The different spaces chosen, along with the diverse types of music produced and consumed, hint at the existence of lines of division and issues of contention among the English- and Afrikaans-speaking counterculture white South Africans. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd on behalf of the University of Witwatersrand.",0
Word production inconsistency of Singaporean-English-speaking adolescents with Down Syndrome,"Background The nature of speech disorders in individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) remains controversial despite various explanations put forth in the literature to account for the observed speech profiles. A high level of word production inconsistency in children with DS has led researchers to query whether the inconsistency continues into adolescence, and if the inconsistency stems from inconsistent phonological disorder (IPD) or childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). Of the studies that have been published, most suggest that the speech profile of individuals with DS is delayed, while a few recent studies suggest a combination of delayed and disordered patterns. However, no studies have explored the nature of word production inconsistency in this population, and the relationship between word production inconsistency, receptive vocabulary and severity of speech disorder. Aims To investigate in a pilot study the extent of word production inconsistency in adolescents with DS and to examine the correlations between word production inconsistency, measures of receptive vocabulary, severity of speech disorder and oromotor skills in adolescents with DS. Methods & Procedures The participants were 32 native speakers of Singaporean-English adolescents, comprising 16 participants with DS and 16 typically developing (TD) participants. The participants completed a battery of standardized speech and language assessments, including The Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) assessment. Results from each test were correlated to determine relationships. Qualitative analyses were also carried out on all the data collected. Outcomes & Results In this study, seven out of 16 participants with DS scored above 40% on word production inconsistency, a diagnostic criterion for IPD. In addition, all participants with DS performed poorly on the oromotor assessment of DEAP. The overall speech profile observed did not exactly correspond with the cluster symptoms observed in children with IPD or CAS. Conclusions & Implications Word production inconsistency is a noticeable feature in the speech of individuals with DS. In addition, the speech profiles of individuals with DS consist of atypical and unusual errors alongside developmental errors. Significant correlations were found between the measures investigated, suggesting that speech disorder in DS is multifactorial. The results from this study will help to improve differential diagnosis of speech disorders and individualized treatment plans in the population with DS. © 2015 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists.",0
Teaching English in early childhood education: Materials and resources,"Numerous existing resources both on the market and on the internet for the teaching of English in early childhood education urge the need to know how to properly select them as regards the priority objectives of this educational level: the holistic training of students in their cognitive, psychomotor and social skills. The aim of this article is to offer a theoretical review of existing materials in the light of the essential contents for teaching very young learners, the pre-reading skills, and their connection with melodies and rhythm. An active teaching method is described based on the distribution of the classroom into working corners and on general principles such as the priority of listening comprehension and action-based learning. Involving all the senses and adding playful elements help to develop young learners&#39; self-confidence and their pronunciation ability. Special emphasis is given to ICT in early ages and to the contribution of multimodal teaching through the selection of music-visual interaction formats specially designed for the learning of foreign languages in early childhood education.",0
A study on improving the listening skills of lower level high school students focused on the pop song hunminglish pronunciation (PSHP) practice in South Korea,"This study aims to improve the listening skills of 254 Korean high school students, who mostly have a lower level of achievement in English through the Pop Song Hunminglish Pronunciation (PSHP) practice. The researcher will investigate the effectiveness with before and after surveys and national English listening tests. The data for analyzing results from March through December in 2014 have been collected from , before and after questionnaires and national English listening tests. The results from this study indicate that English pop songs increased students' interest and motivation levels. This increase has turned out to be about two times greater in scores after 10 months. Therefore it is desirable that more English teachers should use more English pop song materials to improve students' listening skills through building interest and motivation. © 2015 International Information Institute.",1
Early adolescents' emotional perceptions and engagement with popular music activities in everyday life,"This study explored young female and male adolescents' engagement with everyday activities involving popular music and their corresponding emotional perceptions. Sixty-six Grade 8 students (37 females, 29 males), aged 13-14 years from mostly White, English-speaking middle-class families near an urban centre in Western Canada completed a list of daily activities that involved popular music and corresponding personal meanings. Responses were coded according to emergent themes including emotional/value, physical, social/cultural, cognitive/competence and moral/spiritual experiences. Content analyses of personal music definitions showed that for all adolescents, a greater number of youth referred to popular music as an emotional or spiritual experience as compared to a cognitive/competence and physical experiences. Implications for gender-inclusive and developmentally appropriate education are discussed. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",0
Perception of everyday sounds: A developmental study of a free sorting task,"Objectives The analysis of categorization of everyday sounds is a crucial aspect of the perception of our surrounding world. However, it constitutes a poorly explored domain in developmental studies. The aim of our study was to understand the nature and the logic of the construction of auditory cognitive categories for natural sounds during development. We have developed an original approach based on a free sorting task (FST). Indeed, categorization is fundamental for structuring the world and cognitive skills related to, without having any need of the use of language. Our project explored the ability of children to structure their acoustic world, and to investigate how such structuration matures during normal development. We hypothesized that age affects the listening strategy and the category decision, as well as the number and the content of individual categories. Design Eighty-two French children (6-9 years), 20 teenagers (12-13 years), and 24 young adults participated in the study. Perception and categorization of everyday sounds was assessed based on a FST composed of 18 different sounds belonging to three a priori categories: non-linguistic human vocalizations, environmental sounds, and musical instruments. Results Children listened to the sounds more times than older participants, built significantly more classes than adults, and used a different strategy of classification. We can thus conclude that there is an age effect on how the participants accomplished the task. Analysis of the auditory categorization performed by 6-year-old children showed that this age constitutes a pivotal stage, in agreement with the progressive change from a non-logical reasoning based mainly on perceptive representations to the logical reasoning used by older children. In conclusion, our results suggest that the processing of auditory object categorization develops through different stages, while the intrinsic basis of the classification of sounds is already present in childhood. © 2015 Ai et al.",0
How learning a musical instrument affects the development of skills,"Despite numerous studies on skill development, we know little about the effects of extracurricular music activities on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. This study examines how music training during childhood and youth affects the development of cognitive skills, school grades, personality, time use and ambition using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our findings suggest that adolescents with music training have better school grades, are more conscientious, open and ambitious. These effects are stronger among adolescents from lower socio-economic status. In order to address the non-random selection into playing music, we take into account detailed information on the child and its parents, which may determine both the decision to pursue music lessons and educational outcomes. While lacking truly exogenous variations in music activities, our results are robust to a large range of sensitivity tests. We thereby approach causality better than previous observational studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",0
Children literature based program for developing EFL primary pupils’ life skills and language learning strategies,"This study examines the effectiveness of a proposed English language program based on integrating two forms of children literature, mainly short stories and songs, in developing the needed life skills and language learning strategies of primary school students. Besides, it emphasized the importance of providing EFL fifth year primary students with activities and opportunities to raise their awareness of their learning, as it helped students understand how to plan, monitor and evaluate their learning. The study targeted ten life skills distributed under four main categories: cognitive, personal, social and linguistic skills. Ninety fifth grade primary students participated in the present study. Five instruments were used: the needed life skills and language learning strategies checklists, a criterion for selecting the stories and songs, the pre/post life skills measures (situation test, questionnaire, oral interpersonal communication test), language learning strategies questionnaire and the students’ satisfaction/dissatisfaction questionnaire. The program was taught over a period of two months (two sessions per week). Data collected were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methodology. Qualitative methods were used to assess students’ development over the 8 weeks. Results revealed that life skills and language learning strategies can be taught effectively through the medium of children literature. As a whole, this study contributed to the ESL/EFL field by providing information about the importance of skill building for life at young age and that fundamental changes needed for language instruction. Furthermore, the study presents a detailed teaching strategy for teaching life skills through children literature. © 2015 Canadian Center of Science and Education. All rights reserved.",0

A Yankee scholar in coastal South Carolina: William Francis Allen's civil war journals,"New Englander William Allen (1830-1889) is mostly known today as the lead editor of the 1867 anthology Slave Songs of the United States, the earliest published collection of Negro spirituals, and as a distinguished history professor at the University of Wisconsin. During the Civil War, he served from late 1863 through mid-1864 as a member of the “Gideonite band of businessmen, missionaries, and teachers who migrated to the South Carolina Sea Islands as part of the Port Royal Experiment. After the war, he served as assistant superintendent of schools in Charleston from April through July 1865. Allen kept journals during his assignments in South Carolina in which he recorded events and impressions of about several hundred people, especially ex-slaves, along with fellow Gideonites, Union soldiers and officials, and ex-Confederates. In A Yankee Scholar in Coastal South Carolina, editor James Robert Hester has transcribed Allen’s journals and fully annotated them to create a significant documentary source of information on Civil War South Carolina. Hester notes that Allen’s journals are more than travelogues, as he often analyzed the people, events, and ideas he encountered. In addition to being a competent amateur musician, Allen was a Harvard-trained historian and philologist and brought his impressive skills to his writing. Later in his life he became an eminent professor of history at the University of Wisconsin. Hester’s introductory chapter summarizes Allen’s life from his early childhood in Northborough, Massachusetts, through his education at Harvard, his duties as associate principal of the West Newton (Massachusetts) English and Classical School, and his engagement in the Port Royal Experiment. The introduction also surveys Allen’s essays on the South published in the Christian Examiner during the Civil War and his articles written for The Nation at the war’s end. Two chapters cover Allen’s St. Helena and Charleston journals, respectively, and the book closes with a short epilogue. The work is generously annotated, containing almost 600 endnotes, which amplify Allen’s narrative and complement Allen’s vivid glimpses of coastal South Carolina during the Civil War. © 2015 University of South Carolina.",0
The role of experience in children's discrimination of unfamiliar languages,"Five- and six-year-old children (n = 160) participated in three studies designed to explore language discrimination. After an initial exposure period (during which children heard either an unfamiliar language, a familiar language, or music), children performed an ABX discrimination task involving two unfamiliar languages that were either similar (Spanish vs. Italian) or different (Spanish vs. Mandarin). On each trial, participants heard two sentences spoken by two individuals, each spoken in an unfamiliar language. The pair was followed by a third sentence spoken in one of the two languages. Participants were asked to judge whether the third sentence was spoken by the first speaker or the second speaker. Across studies, both the difficulty of the discrimination contrast and the relation between exposure and test materials affected children's performance. In particular, language discrimination performance was facilitated by an initial exposure to a different unfamiliar language, suggesting that experience can help tune children's attention to the relevant features of novel languages. © 2015 Potter and Saffran.",0
The relationship between multiple intelligence profiles and reading strategy use of successful English as a foreign language (EFL) readers,"This study relied on Sheorey and Mokhtari’s (2001) metacognitive knowledge about reading strategies,which was influenced by a number of factors, including previous experiences, beliefs, culture-specific instructional practices and proficiency in a second language (L2). This study is thereby built on the premise that EFL readers’ metacognitive awareness of reading strategies was also influenced by their multiple intelligence profiles. The purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impact of multiple intelligences and reading strategies on EFL learners’ reading performance. This was an explanatory sequential study, combining quantitative and qualitative research design. A convenience sample of 60 high school EFL learners from one of the Anatolian high schools in Istanbul, Turkey participated in this study. Two quantitative surveys and an achievement test, followed by a qualitative observation checklist, were used in this study to collect the data. The results of the study indicated that females were found to be more successful than males in EFL reading in addition to employing more support and problem solving reading strategies. In addition, this study also found that successful readers in EFL seemed to use more global strategies and tended to support reading strategies if they were dominant in musical, intrapersonal intelligences. Moreover, successful musically or verbally intelligent readers were found to use more problem-solving strategies. As a result, this study provides EFL teachers and curriculum designers with valuable information that will foster awareness of the role of these intelligence-strategy relations may play in triggering success in EFL reading, and thus, in their overall proficiency in the language. © 2015, Foundation for Education Science and Technology.

Musical plus phonological input for young foreign language readers,"Based on previous studies showing that phonological awareness is related to reading abilities and that music training improves phonological processing, the aim of the present study was to test for the efficiency of a new method for teaching to read in a foreign language. Specifically, we tested the efficacy of a phonological training program, with and without musical support that aimed at improving early reading skills in 7-8-year-old Spanish children (n = 63) learning English as a foreign language. Of interest was also to explore the impact of this training program on working memory and decoding skills. To achieve these goals we tested three groups of children before and after training: a control group, an experimental group with phonological non-musical intervention (active control), and an experimental group with musical intervention. Results clearly point to the beneficial effects of the phonological teaching approach but the further impact of the music support was not demonstrated. Moreover, while children in the music group showed low musical aptitudes before training, they nevertheless performed better than the control group. Therefore, the phonological training program with and without music support seem to have significant effects on early reading skills. © 2015 Fonseca-Mora, Jara-Jiménez and Gómez-Domínguez.",1
Longitudinal effects of group music instruction on literacy skills in low-income children,"Children from low-socioeconomic backgrounds tend to fall progressively further behind their higher-income peers over the course of their academic careers. Music training has been associated with enhanced language and learning skills, suggesting that music programs could play a role in helping low-income children to stay on track academically. Using a controlled, longitudinal design, the impact of group music instruction on English reading ability was assessed in 42 low-income Spanish-English bilingual children aged 6-9 years in Los Angeles. After one year, children who received music training retained their age-normed level of reading performance while a matched control group's performance deteriorated, consistent with expected declines in this population. While the extent of change is modest, outcomes nonetheless provide evidence that music programs may have value in helping to counteract the negative effects of low-socioeconomic status on child literacy development. © 2014 Slater et al.",0
The relationship between english language learner status and music ensemble participation,"Authors of previous research have reported that U.S. English language learner (ELL) students participate in school-sponsored music ensembles (band, orchestra, and choir) at a lower rate than their native-English-speaking peers (non-ELLs). The current study examined this phenomenon using a nationally representative sample of U.S. 10th graders (14- to 16-year-olds across 751 high schools, N = 15,011) to estimate school music ensemble participation rates for ELL and non-ELL students. Consistent with prior research, initial results indicated that individual ELL status was a significant, negative predictor of participation. However, when our analyses took into account student socioeconomic status and academic achievement, results provided no evidence that ELL students participate in ensembles at different rates than non-ELL students. Results also indicate that school membership accounted for different ensemble participation rates. It may be that lack of opportunity - not lack of interest - explains the gap between ELL and non-ELL music participation that has been observed in prior research. © National Association for Music Education 2014.",0
A longitudinal study on children's music training experience and academic development,"This study examined the relation between long-term music training and child development based on 250 Chinese elementary school students' academic development of first language (L1), second language (L2), and mathematics. We found that musician children outperformed non-musician children only on musical achievement and second language development. Additionally, although music training appeared to be correlated with children's final academic development of L1, L2, and mathematics, it did not independently contribute to the development of L1 or mathematical skills. Our findings suggest caution in interpreting the positive findings on the non-musical cognitive benefits of music learning.",0
All about dolphins in secondary education,"Undoubtedly the most amiable and intelligent creature of the sea is dolphin. Children and adults all over the world enjoy the company of dolphins while traveling by ship or visit aquariums to watch their shows. As a result, students love to learn things about these wonderful species and their habitats, while teachers round the world prepare lesson plans and projects on dolphins' biology, social life and way of communication, which usually include methods of protection and preservation of marine biodiversity, as well as reduction of human impacts and threatening factors on marine mammals in order to save them from the brink of extinction. Especially in Greek Secondary Education there are several additional aspects to be studied (though it would be useful elsewhere and it has already been implemented abroad): Ancient Greek Mythology on dolphins, possible interpretations of these myths, works of Ancient Greek or Greek-speaking authors as Homer, Herodotus, Pausanias, Pliny and Aelian, places strongly connected to dolphins like Delphi and Knossos and Gods like Apollo and Poseidon, pictorial representations of dolphins in works of art, paintings, sculptures and coins and finally modern literature and poetry, music, documentaries and cinema. This chapter aims at presenting a complete educational program on dolphins which would be useful and applicable all over the English-speaking world and is dedicated to numerous people who have devoted their lives on research and endeavors to save dolphins from extinction. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",0
Pro Mundo - Pro Domo: The Writings of Alban Berg,"This book contains new English translations of the complete writings of the Viennese composer Alban Berg (1885-1935) and extensive commentaries tracing the history of each piece of work and its connection to musical culture of the early twentieth century. Berg is now recognized as a classic composer of the modern period, best known for his operas Wozzeck and Lulu. Berg, Anton Webern, and their teacher Arnold Schoenberg constitute the ""Second Viennese School"" which played a major role in the transformation of serious music as it entered the modern period. Berg was an avid and skilled writer. His work includes analytic studies of compositions by Schoenberg, polemics on music and musicians of his day, and lectures and miscellaneous writings on a variety of topics. Throughout his considerable and diverse corpus of writings, Berg alternates between two perspectives: Pro Mundo-Pro Domo, meaning roughly ""speaking for all-speaking for myself"" commenting at one moment on the general state of culture and the world, and the next moment on his own works. In his early years he also tried his hand at fictional writing, using works by Ibsen and Strindberg as models. This new English edition contains forty-seven pieces of his work, many of which are little known and have not been previously available in English. © Oxford University Press 2014.

Speaking in noise: How does the Lombard effect improve acoustic contrasts between speech and ambient noise?,"What makes speech produced in the presence of noise (Lombard speech) more intelligible than conversational speech produced in quiet conditions? This study investigates the hypothesis that speakers modify their speech in the presence of noise in such a way that acoustic contrasts between their speech and the background noise are enhanced, which would improve speech audibility. Ten French speakers were recorded while playing an interactive game first in quiet condition, then in two types of noisy conditions with different spectral characteristics: a broadband noise (BB) and a cocktail-party noise (CKTL), both played over loudspeakers at 86 dB SPL. Similarly to (Lu and Cooke, 2009b), our results suggest no systematic ""active"" adaptation of the whole speech spectrum or vocal intensity to the spectral characteristics of the ambient noise. Regardless of the type of noise, the gender or the type of speech segment, the primary strategy was to speak louder in noise, with a greater adaptation in BB noise and an emphasis on vowels rather than any type of consonants. Active strategies were evidenced, but were subtle and of second order to the primary strategy of speaking louder: for each gender, fundamental frequency (f0) and first formant frequency (F1) were modified in cocktail-party noise in a way that optimized the release in energetic masking induced by this type of noise. Furthermore, speakers showed two additional modifications as compared to shouted speech, which therefore cannot be interpreted in terms of vocal effort only: they enhanced the modulation of their speech in f0 and vocal intensity and they boosted their speech spectrum specifically around 3 kHz, in the region of maximum ear sensitivity associated with the actor's or singer's formant. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Syria’s ‘arab spring’: Women and the struggle to live in truth,"There has been no prejudice in the violence and atrocities that have befallen Syria since the start of the uprising in early 2011, be it against man, child or woman. Many have been detained, tortured and murdered; too many have witnessed the death of their families, friends and/or partners. They are faced with daily suffering; searching for food to feed their families; cowering from bomb attacks; fearing the arrest or kidnapping of a loved one and dealing with the torment of displacement for the foreseeable future. Sexual violence and prostitution are increasingly common features of the situation in which Syrians find themselves immersed. Just as the suffering, the list of what people have been enduring throughout this conflict is endless. As a consequence it is unsurprising that increasing numbers of both men and women have joined in the struggle for Syria’s freedom. It is sometimes difficult to grasp the extent of the complexity and the intricate organization of the Syrian oppositional movements, particularly if we are to solely rely on the information provided by the mainstream media which has the tendency to only illuminate very limited aspects of the conflict. The political opposition bodies and the Free Syrian Army are predominantly made up of men, albeit a few prominent women such as Suhair Atassi, a human rights activist involved in the Damascus Spring2 and now co-vice president of the opposition government. Another increasing dominance is the fear of Islamic extremists and Al Qaeda-linked groups infiltrating opposition fighters. Rafif Jouejati (interview, 19 April 2013), 3 a Syrian activist and the English spokesperson for the Local Coordination Committees, highlights how ‘traditional media often fails to adequately report on the secular movement or the ongoing civil resistance’, which is made up of an extensive network of people largely dominated by women both from within and outside of the country. Women are rarely a feature of the media coverage unless it is regarding the use of women as weapons of war, including such issues as sexual violence, prostitution, human trafficking and arranged marriages, particularly among Syrian refugees. While these are certainly issues to be concerned with and which deserve the media coverage they receive, their dominance in the media has done little to publicize the vital roles of women within the uprising whose contributions have been both accepted and depended upon by their male compatriots. Significant numbers of Syria’s women have played an active role in the revolution right from the start of the peaceful protests that began in early March 2011, including the infiltration of a pro-regime protest by Marwa al-Ghamian on 15 March, who ‘walked between a sea of men chanting for Bashar while she was carrying the only flag in the crowd. She boldly flipped the chants by replacing “Bashar” with “Syria.” This woman with her flag and patriotic chants represented the birth of the revolution’ (interview with Amal Hanano, 17 April 2013). There was also the protest organized by Suhair Atassi and Dana Al Jawabra4 in Damascus on 16 March, in which they demanded ‘the release of all political prisoners including that of Tal Al Malouhi, the seventeen year-old blogger who was detained in 2009 for her political posts. At the time, Malouhi was the youngest prisoner of conscience in the world’ (interview with Amal Hanano, 2013). As the conflict developed, so too did their numbers and their roles, with many becoming ‘important links in relaying information between the different rebel groups’ (interview with Khawla Yusuf, 16 April 2013). Their participation in the revolution has been both vast and integral and has taken place within rural and urban areas of Syria and also from abroad: Women have led protests, staged sit-ins, and been among the creative masterminds of the civil disobedience movement. As the uprising has gone on, women have served as reporters, documenters of human rights violations, nurses, doctors, smugglers and relief workers. Women have also served in combat, as evidenced by new Free Syrian Army all-women brigades. Abroad, women have also staged and participated in non-violent protests and have formed civil society organizations, lobbied, raised funds and spoken out in support of the revolution. © 2015 Larbi Sadiki, editorial and selection matter; individual chapters, the contributors.",0
Family issues for women engineers,"In many English-speaking economies less than 15 per cent of professional engineers are women (NSF, 2012; Kirkup et al., 2010; Kaspura, 2013), and furthermore women are more likely to leave the profession than men (Frehill, 2009; Hunt, 2010; Kirkup et al., 2010; Kaspura, 2013). It has been suggested that difficulties of combining motherhood and the attendant childcare responsibilities with an engineering career contribute to women’s attrition from the profession after about ten years (Blackwell and Glover, 2008; Fouad and Singh, 2011; Plett et al., 2011; for example). This chapter considers the issues that affect work-family decisions of women engineers in Australia and some other Western countries. After examining the evidence that these issues are at least partly responsible for women leaving the profession, we explore ways that women who have stayed in the profession have resolved these issues, focusing particularly on the Australian context. Their solutions may suggest strategies to other women engineers faced with conflict in their work-life integration, and also strategies for implementation and support by managers and employing organisations who wish to improve the retention of women in the engineering profession. In Australia, the progress of women in the engineering profession has been tracked over 13 years by Engineers Australia (EA), the national engineers’ professional body, through a series of three surveys of its members. © Diana Bilimoria and Linley Lord 2014.",0
Female gymnasium education in Kursk governorate in the second half of the 19th century through the early 20th century,"In 1850, even Petersburg didn't have any educational institution to teach daughters of poor noblemen and government servants. Female education became a major teaching innovation of the second half of the 19th century. Women's colleges were established in Vologda, Tver, Ryazan, Samara, Tula, Smolensk, and Nizhny Novgorod in the late 1858. Female secondary education was organized very much due to Nikolay Vyshnegradsky, who was a Russian teacher, professor, advocate of egalitarian female education, and founder of the Russky pedagoguichesky vestnik magazine. Vyshnegradsky was the first to introduce women's gymnasia and to develop a Charter in 1862 that was taken as a basis of gymnasium activities. The curriculum included the Divine Law, Russian grammar, Russian history and geography, arithmetic, French and German languages, calligraphy, music, dancing, and needlework. This curriculum differed considerably from the one in traditional men's gymnasia. Although the level of education was rather high in some of women's gymnasia, their graduates were not allowed to enter universities or any other governmental higher educational institutions. It was only in 1872-1876 when a number of higher female courses were initiated under the influence of progressive communities. In this paper, we have analyzed organization of teaching and learning processes based on the materials from State archives of Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts. We have also provided some examples of women's gymnasium practices in Kursk Governorate in the second half of the 19th century through the early 20th century, including the First World War period.",0
The small-college stage is there still room for Shakespeare,"In the wake of the Great Recession, debates about the decline of the humanities and the place of the humanities and arts in American higher education have arisen both in the popular media and in academia itself. English and theater departments can no longer even take Shakespeare for granted. Though the Bard has weathered many a cultural and educational crisis, humanities and arts departments are having – yet again – to justify what we teach, including traditional courses like the Shakespeare or art history survey, in terms of utility and job preparation. In other words, we have moved beyond the calls of past culture-warriors for a return to canonical literature and fully into the anti-aesthetic world of the bottom line. Though recently formulated Common Core Standards for high school reading do not intend to diminish the importance of literature, they very deliberately increase the relative weight of informational nonfiction reading over traditional literary studies (drama, fiction, poetry) on the presumption that the latter distract from the former, which are necessary for business. Many educators saw David Coleman, chief advocate of the Common Core Standards and president of the College Board, as hostile to traditional narrative: “It would be rare for someone in the workplace to say, ‘Johnson, I need a market analysis by Friday, but before that, I need a compelling account of your childhood.’” Was Coleman really deriding the basic worth of traditional literary modes? If so, whither Hawthorne, Dickinson, Morrison, and Shakespeare? Needless to say, there are no national standards for education in the arts, performing or plastic, presumably because their utility is assumed to be low in terms of job preparation and marketability. Artistic practice is seen as a luxury available to the elite; literary interpretation, scholarship, and criticism, as hopelessly arcane studies. Never mind that research, much more sophisticated than media hype about the “Mozart effect” on infants and toddlers in the 1990s, shows a correlation between engagement in music programs and academic achievement. To face the future and to serve students well, to ensure that we can pass on not just the skills but also the habits of mind inherent in liberal arts education, our departments need ingenuity – a willingness to rethink and restructure programs creatively to meet students where they are and then to bring them along, albeit down nontraditional paths. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",0
The high school history term paper as an introduction to the humanities and academic rigor and excellence,"The informal introduction to the humanities begins in elementary schools and middle schools, but it is not until high school, that there is a formal in depth evaluation and examination of some of the humanities subjects. This paper will review a project that has been in place for many years to assist students in their appreciation of the humanities and provide an outlet for their investigative and creative endeavors. While exposure to art, music, and theatre may be a wonderful entrance gate to the humanities, the formal term paper, typically expected in high schools serves not just as an in depth exploration of a humanities subject, it also encourages a deep, appreciative examination of one topic. One avenue that has been provided for students for the past 27 years is a journal known as the Concord Review. The Concord Review has been in operation since 1987 and has been edited by Will Fitzhugh. It was founded with two main goals. First, to find, and recognize exemplary history research papers by secondary students throughout the English-speaking world. The second goal was to publish, the best of these to provide their peers (and their teachers) with examples to inspire, challenge and motivate students to read more history and work on strong history research papers of their own. For the first goal, 1, 110 outstanding papers have now been published in 101 issues by authors from 46 states and 39 other countries. The second goal is much farther from being reached. Many teachers cannot see the value of having their students read the superlative work of their peers from other schools, and other states and countries. It showcases the best high school writing in not just the United States, but literally the world. Students from various high schools submit their in -depth exploration of some topic, occasionally based on some hypothesis or simply an area of interest and if deemed worthy, the paper is published in The Concord Review. The showcasing of exemplary work is a way to justify the importance of the humanities- and in this case- the realm of history and historical related topics. The Concord Review has covered historical, political, economic, personal, geographical and legal issues- based on the library research of said high school students. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The songs of C. P. E. Bach: A performer's perspective,"The songs of C. P. E. Bach, while not a primary part of his artistic output, represent a substantial portion of his œuvre and reflect a commitment on the composer's part to expressing profound spiritual and moral concepts. The songs also make a significant contribution to the flowering of the German lied tradition, which is generally considered to begin in the early 19th century with Schubert but which has deep antecedents in the 18th century. The confluence of a rapidly evolving musical language, the philosophical tradition of the Enlightenment, and a native tradition of strophic poetry and song gave rise to the highly compressed, harmonically potent style of Bach's lieder. Individual songs by C. P. E. Bach are examined for their inventiveness, emotional potency and sensitivity to the text. Selections from each of his three major song collections, as well as secular songs and a large-scale cantata for voice and keyboard, are described in detail. Issues surrounding performance, which may affect the current obscurity of these pieces, are considered: how to programme, edit and perform the songs; what keyboard instrument is best suited; and what skills a singer needs to bring to bear for a modern recital audience. © 2014 The Author.",0
A study of the relationship between musical perception skills and phonological awareness in Spanish,"In this study the relationship between skills to distinguish musical variables and phonological awareness was studied in children between six and eight years of age. Previous studies in English report a connection between these skills; however, no studies of this kind have been done in Spanish. The results of this study indicate that this relationship does not exist in Spanish. This difference relates to the orthographic characteristics of these languages (opaque vs. transparent), and the implications of these results for reading learning are discussed. © 2014 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.",0
Natural acquisition of the second language (l2) through routine movements in children,"Research is increasingly showing that the brains of people who know two or more languages are different from those who know just one-and those differences are all for better. (Kluger, J., Times Magazine 2013). Multilingual people, studies show, are better at reasoning, at multitasking, at grasping and reconciling conflicting ideas. A bilingual brain is proving to be more flexible and more resourceful. Gregg Roberts, a language-immersion specialist with the Utah State Office of Education, says, ""Monolingualism is the illiteracy of the 21st century"", (Kluger, J., Times Magazine 2013). This preliminary project would demonstrate that acquiring a second language for children is possible through an alternative teaching proposal that integrates body into the natural language acquisition process thanks to a new didactic method fun and exciting which stimulates children to consider the second language more friendly and less hostile. The groups we are going to consider attend the last year of the infant school, they come from different schools, the first group, (the random group) attends regularly at school, traditional frontal lessons of the second language (L2), two hours a week; the second group, (experimental group) doesn't learn the second language at school but will start our experimental programme which allows them to acquire the second language through routine movements during the gymnastic hours for one hour a week. In this way children start to decode the language and slowly become confident with it. This method consider that teaching the second language will become more difficult as children grow, and grow their ability to the movements: as movements become more complicated so will the vocabulary become more complex (Doron, H. ready-steady-move 2007-2013). Starting from this preliminary study we would demonstrate that the experimental group, compared to the random group, even if exposed to the second language one hour a week less than the random group, will be able to remember and perform routine movements if exposed to the second language and imitating the teacher: smiling, laughing, turning around, walking, reaching, sitting, running, and so forth. This methodology will be more efficient than a traditional teaching lesson because children will learn naturally and in their natural environment. Dr. Asher calls this ""a language-body conversation"" because the parent/teacher speaks and the infant answers with a physical response; in this case the teacher gets immediate feedback that the children understand when they give an appropriate physical response (Kovács, 2010). To conclude, we must consider that children are happy when they can play, move and sing, all better if these activities are combined. There is a saying that a child does not do what he has learnt, but rather the contrary: he learns what he has already done (Kovács, 2010). That's why in early language acquisition, activities linked with movements, competitions, dance and group games are very important. All these need time to develop receptive skills (understanding based on listening) before the productive use of the language appears (Kovacs, 2010). For the future we would refine the method, consider a wider group of children and of different ages, and experiment the natural language acquisition also in specific motor disciplines. © Faculty of Education.

The effect of modern lyrical music on second language vocabulary acquisition,"In recent studies, vocabulary acquisition has received a high premium as it plays an important role in second language acquisition.Yet in the midst of increasing satisfaction with the field’s maturity, a number of rather fundamental questions remained unanswered. One of the most important questions concerned the effect of music on second language vocabulary acquisition.The aim of this study is to a) investigate the effect of music on second language vocabulary acquisition; b) investigate the effect of music on long term retention of vocabulary. For this purpose sixty girl students of a junior high school were randomly selected and assigned to two groups of thirty.The first group (experimental group) was the music group, the second (control group was the no music group.The effect of treatment on vocabulary acquisition was assessed immediately after the treatment.The research hypotheses was:1)music has no effect on vocabulary acquisition of students in junior high school in Iran 2) music has no effect on long term retention of vocabulary.The analysis of the collected data through applying ttest revealed that there was a significant differences between the two groups. The music group outperformed the no-music group both in short and long term retention.The results show that music has positive effect on vocabulary acquisition.Therefore the null hypotheses was rejected. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

Spanish-speaking children's production of number morphology,"Infants across cultures need to identify the characteristics of their native languages in order to become competent speakers. The means by which Spanish-speaking children learn to produce number-gender linguistic markers has not been sufficiently investigated. Thirty-eight three-year-olds were tested in Berko-like production tasks, in which they were asked to pluralize or singularize familiar and novel words, with controls for allomorph, number of syllables, and word familiarity. Children found it easier to pluralize and singularize words with the allomorph /-s/ than those requiring /-es/, independent of their familiarity or syllable length. Children also produced a wide variety of noun phrases in which they tended to mark number information in more than one element. These data suggest that Spanish-speaking children's inflectional abilities are mainly influenced by phonological features such as word-endings and not, as previously reported, by the familiarity of the word or syllable length. © The Author(s) 2014.",0

Song and speech prosody influences VOT in stuttering and non-stuttering adolescents,"Since a long time, it is known that singing helps persons who stutter to produce their utterances more fluently. The prosodic characteristics of spoken and sung utterances differ considerably in their rhythmic and tonal structure. Therefore, it has been proposed that song prosody helps stutterers to improve their rhythmic planning of verbal material [1]. In order to investigate this idea, we examined temporal aspects, namely Voice Onset Time (henceforth, VOT) of voiceless plosives, in sung and spoken utterances of young German stutterers and non-stuttering controls. VOT tends to be reduced in song compared to speech. We expected a more important reduction in the stuttering group as voice onset timing should be facilitated in song compared to speech. Eight stuttering adolescents and eight normal fluent peers read and sang an altered version of ""Happy Birthday"" with test words containing the three voiceless stops /p/, /t/, /k/. Results showed that stuttering as well as non-stuttering adolescents reduced VOT during singing compared to speech. In contrast, only adolescents who stutter were less variable in their VOT production in song compared to speech. Additional analyses indicated further group differences in vowel duration following the stop consonant. These findings suggest that young stutterers benefit from sung prosody in their timing abilities.",0
Conceptions of woodwind students regarding the process of learning a piece of music,"The way in which students and teachers conceive the nature of knowledge and its acquisition has been deeply investigated in recent decades since these conceptions underlie teaching and learning processes themselves. In this study, we analysed how woodwind students from different levels of expertise conceive the process of learning a musical piece. As in previous studies about learning processes in music, we divide it into three stages: the beginning (first sessions of study of the new piece), the middle of the process (the student continues practising) and the end (the sessions before the performance). Sixty-eight Spanish woodwind students from three different levels of instruction completed an open-ended questionnaire. A statistical analysis of textual data was applied to the responses, in order to identify lexical differences among groups of participants about their learning conceptions. Statistically significant lexical differences were found for the variable 'Level', and three lexical groups were identified for each stage of learning, corresponding to the three levels. Elementary students held a conception of learning in which there is a linear relationship between conditions (amount of practice time, repetition) and outcomes (mainly related to notational elements), giving a small presence to the learner's agency. Intermediate students began to consider the internal structure of the piece and its expressive function, and they particularly emphasised mental processes involved in learning. Advanced students suggested activities requiring a greater degree of autonomy and reflection, considering the piece as an element for the performer's expression. Changes in goals and activities mentioned for the different stages of learning were also identified for each level. Results suggest that as level of instruction progress, it becomes more probable to find more sophisticated conceptions, which is consistent with previous research in several knowledge domains. Implications for education are discussed. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",0
Young EFL students' engagements with English outside the classroom,"Following the global trend in primary English language instruction, the Ministry of Education in Mexico has recently included English as an additional language as part of the national curriculum for primary grades. Some have questioned whether early EFL programmes can work, given the few instructional hours per week and limited exposure to the target language in non-English speaking environments. However, this article reveals that children in EFL settings often use English more than is commonly thought, and in surprising ways. It examines the types of engagements that primary school students in Mexico have with English when the teacher is not around. These engagements, especially through music, movies, and video games, illustrate the creative ways children draw on their emerging linguistic resources and employ a variety of tools to accomplish a range of communicative functions in English. The results of the study outlined in this article suggest that they can be sources from which teachers can draw pedagogical inspiration. © The Author 2014.

Children's musical and social behaviours in the context of music-making activities supported by digital tools: Examples from a pilot study in the United Kingdom,"Children's enjoyable experience in music-making has been reported to be crucial for their social and musical development. This research investigates the way in which participant young children develop their musical and social skills by digital technology-supported music-making activities within a multicultural educational context. Two different software packages were used in the research. Data collection methods reported in the current article included observations and field notes, video analyses and dialogue analyses. Initial results indicate that children developed their musical knowledge as a part of their active interaction with others. In particular, their use of digital tools provided a supportive environment for collaborative music-making. In this process, which seems to be non-linear in nature, children were observed to develop negotiation skills, empathy and a tendency to verbalize their thoughts whilst exchanging their musical ideas. The initial findings, therefore, provide evidence that using appropriate music technology in a classroom can be of benefit for children to develop musical and social skills. © 2014 Intellect Ltd Article.

Majority learners acquiring a minority language in a bilingual community,"Children who learn a language in a linguistic minority context often have limited opportunities to use it outside the home and school. This is the case for English speaking children who learn French in Northern Ontario, Canada, where the majority language is English. However, these children learn their native language without great difficulty. At the outset, different linguistic contexts in which both majority and minority language learners dwell will be examined for a comparison. Very little research has demonstrated how bilingual English-French children learn French as a second language (L2) in an English dominant context. It is important to specify that these children are not learning French in an immersion program but rather through a French school system. Parents chose to enroll their children in French schools in order to provide them with the opportunity to become bilingual, even though they themselves often only speak English. An ethnolinguistic practical model has been proposed for empirical validation to better account for the individual and societal influences on second language acquisition in a bilingual community. © Common Ground, Manon Robillard, Chantal Mayer-Crittenden, All Rights Reserved.",0
"How musical training affects cognitive development: Rhythm, reward and other modulating variables","Musical training has recently gained additional interest in education as increasing neuroscientific research demonstrates its positive effects on brain development. Neuroimaging revealed plastic changes in the brains of adult musicians but it is still unclear to what extent they are the product of intensive music training rather than of other factors, such as preexisting biological markers of musicality. In this review, we synthesize a large body of studies demonstrating that benefits of musical training extend beyond the skills it directly aims to train and last well into adulthood. For example, children who undergo musical training have better verbal memory, second language pronunciation accuracy, reading ability and executive functions. Learning to play an instrument as a child may even predict academic performance and IQ in young adulthood. The degree of observed structural and functional adaptation in the brain correlates with intensity and duration of practice. Importantly, the effects on cognitive development depend on the timing of musical initiation due to sensitive periods during development, as well as on several other modulating variables. Notably, we point to motivation, reward and social context of musical education, which are important yet neglected factors affecting the long-term benefits of musical training. Further, we introduce the notion of rhythmic entrainment and suggest that it may represent a mechanism supporting learning and development of executive functions. It also hones temporal processing and orienting of attention in time that may underlie enhancements observed in reading and verbal memory. We conclude that musical training uniquely engenders near and far transfer effects, preparing a foundation for a range of skills, and thus fostering cognitive development. © 2014 Miendlarzewska and Trost.",0
Old and new media in the lives of young disadvantaged bilingual children,"There is increasing interest in the use of new media. In particular, educational television, computer and video games, as well as animated electronic picture books are the focus of a good deal of recent attention in early childhood. There are good reasons for this interest. First, society is changing. The introduction in society at large and in schools in particular of modern information technology has repercussions for how we try to prepare young children for school and society. Preparing children only with “traditional media”— printed books, conversations about topics of general interest, songs and rhymes, oral stories-runs the risk of being ill-matched to the new demands (Shaffer, 2006). Second, “traditional” media are a less efﬁcient means of stimulating children's language development and emergent school skills to some extent in low income and ethnic minority communities, because of the demands they put on the parents. Attempts to improve the home language and literacy environment to promote low income children's language and emergent literacy often run up against parents’ own lack of skills (van Tuijl, Leseman, & Rispens, 2001). Preparing children with a different ﬁrst language for participation in the second language context of school may fail because the parents are not sufﬁciently proﬁcient in the second language. New media might provide for alternative ways to promote language and other skills in low literate and bilingual homes. Third and most important, new media are already present in young children's lives. Home computers and electronic games have found their way into many homes. Electronics for education and entertainment play a major role in the lives of adolescents and adults, and this role is expected to increase further (Duimel & de Haan, 2007; Mullen, Martin, Gonzales, & Kennedy, 2003). © 2009 Routledge, Taylor and Francis.",0
The NUS sung and spoken lyrics corpus: A quantitative comparison of singing and speech,"Despite a long-standing effort to characterize various aspects of the singing voice and their relations to speech, the lack of a suitable and publicly available dataset has precluded any systematic study on the quantitative difference between singing and speech at the phone level. We hereby present the NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics Corpus (NUS-48E corpus) as the first step toward a large, phonetically annotated corpus for singing voice research. The corpus is a 169-min collection of audio recordings of the sung and spoken lyrics of 48 (20 unique) English songs by 12 subjects and a complete set of transcriptions and duration annotations at the phone level for all recordings of sung lyrics, comprising 25,474 phone instances. Using the NUS-48E corpus, we conducted a preliminary, quantitative study on the comparison between singing voice and speech. The study includes duration analyses of the sung and spoken lyrics, with a primary focus on the behavior of consonants, and experiments aiming to gauge how acoustic representations of spoken and sung phonemes differ, as well as how duration and pitch variations may affect the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features. © 2013 APSIPA.",0
Children benefit from morphological relatedness when they learn to spell new words,"Use of morphologically related words often helps in selecting among spellings of sounds in French. For instance, final /wa/ may be spelled oi (e.g., envoi ""sendoff""), oit (e.g., exploit ""exploit""), ois (e.g., siamois, ""siamese""), or oie (e.g., joie ""joy""). The morphologically complex word exploiter ""to exploit"", with a pronounced t, can be used to indicate that the stem exploit is spelled with a silent t. We asked whether 8-year-old children benefited from such cues to learn new spellings. Children read silently stories which included two target nonwords, one presented in an opaque condition and the other in a morphological condition. In the opaque condition, the sentence provided semantic information (e.g., a vensois is a musical instrument) but no morphological information that could justify the spelling of the target word's final sound. Such justification was available in the morphological condition (e.g., the vensoisist plays the vensois instrument, which justifies that vensois includes a final silent s). 30 min after having read the stories, children's orthographic learning was assessed by asking them to choose the correct spelling of each nonword from among three phonologically plausible alternatives (e.g., vensois, vensoit, vensoie). Children chose correct spellings more often in the morphological condition than the opaque condition, even though the root (vensois) had been presented equally often in both conditions. That is, children benefited from information about the spelling of the morphologically complex word to learn the spelling of the stem. © 2013 Pacton, Foulin, Casalis and Treiman.",0
Four approaches to implementing digital media in art education,"This article is included in a research project called Skolämnesparadigm och undervisningspraktik i skärmkulturen–bild, musik och svenska [“School subject paradigm and teaching practice in the screen culture–art, music and Swedish”]. Due to digital changes in the media world of pictures and art, digital media are implemented in the Swedish school subject “bild”, art in English-speaking countries, in secondary school. The school subject bild is seen as conforming to a school subject paradigm. It is supposed to meet another paradigm, ICT and digital media, with its values and expectancies. What happens if a traditional art subject paradigm, with the idea of the relevance of manual expression of self and of traditional techniques, meets digital media? Four different approaches to the implementation of digital media in the subject of art are discussed: resistance, add-on, embeddedness and digital media as dominant. The main focus is what is happening to the core of the subject, called the sacred, and what really is the core and sacred of the subject. Also discussed is what we call the profane of the subject, which may be expelled, and the relationship between the sacred and profane. Is digitalisation the future of the art subject or is it a way of leaving the art subject the way we are used to thinking of it? We are using empirical studies in nine schools in Sweden, including observations and interviews with pupils, art teachers and school administrators, that are accounted for in other articles. © 2013, © 2013 Anders Marner & Hans Örtegren.",0
Beyond computer science: Computational thinking across disciplines,"In her influential CACM article, Jeannette Wing argues that computational thinking is an emerging basic skill that should become an integral part of every child's education [14]. The potential impact of any approach for incorporating computational thinking into the curriculum is limited by the low enrollment in computing classes and the homogeneous population choosing these classes. While there are continuing efforts to draw students into computing courses, a complementary approach is to bring computational thinking into courses already taken by a diverse set of students. Because computing is transforming society and impacting many areas of study, providing students with meaningful exposure to computational thinking in other fields can be done without compromising existing learning goals. Modifying the K-12 curriculum to include a stronger emphasis on computational thinking has great potential. This effort is difficult in the U.S. however, since computer science is not a core high school topic and there are too few K-12 computing teachers to implement a national-scale computing requirement [2]. Projects that work to integrate computational thinking into existing discipline-specific courses show promise in overcoming these barriers [4, 5, 8, 15]. A comprehensive set of K-12 teacher resources has been developed jointly by the Computer Science Teachers Association and the International Society for Technology in Education [1]. The current emphasis by K-12 educators on 21st Century Skills provides a natural entry for incorporating computational thinking across the curriculum. The need for teaching computational thinking continues past secondary education. Spurred by funding from the National Science Foundation, researchers have considered how to revamp the undergraduate curriculum to place a greater emphasis on these concepts. A number of NSF-funded projects have focused on finding ways to enhance computational thinking in undergraduate courses outside the standard computing curriculum [3, 6, 9, 13]. In this panel we discuss several projects that have worked to integrate computational thinking into the secondary and undergraduate curriculum in disciplines outside of computing such as art, astronomy, biology, economics, English, geology, government, kinesiology, history, music, and sociology. We will summarize the primary challenges and lessons learned. Following the description of our projects we will have an open discussion about overcoming challenges, what care should be taken to incorporate computing into other disciplines without sacrificing important traditions, and alternative and complementary approaches such as creating complete computational tracks within other disciplines.",0
"Building literacy through media-rich projects: Slow down, look, and connect","This chapter details a case study of a librarian and high school English teacher who collaborated on Shakespeare projects to improve students' critical reading of sonnets and soliloquies. The literary analysis goal expanded as students developed media-rich products that reflected media literacy skills: performing advanced searches, locating research to inform image selection of primary sources, and evaluating images to communicate analysis of Shakespeare works. Students also modeled digital citizenship skills by respecting the copyright of images, and exploring contemporary images from creative commons sites. Following fair use guidelines, students created transformative works, adding value to and repurposing copyrighted materials. Text, images, and music were combined into a movie using the free digital software Animoto. The school librarian and teacher successfully collaborated, supporting goals of improving literacy and helping students to become 21st century learners. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",0
"""We Are the Etcetera"": Homeschooling in the Iranian society","The aim of this study is to explore the situation of homeschooling in Iranian system of education. The results of this study derive from a qualitative research performed in 2012. The research population was selected by snowball method. The participants were interviewed. The interviews were semi-structured. The concepts in each interview were extracted. Similar concepts were classified and primary and secondary contents were extracted. The data discussed was based on theoretical foundations. The study showed that all parents in the sample come from middle and upper-middle class of the Iranian society and are highly educated. Participants' involvement in the education of their children and risk-taking in this regard was high. They didn't have a positive view toward the formal system of education, but their decision for homeschooling their children was mostly educational (which is influenced by the ideas of Rousseau and Dewey), not ideological. They consider the formal system of education as a unilateral system, which destroys the creativity of children, merely emphasizes memorization, and neglects some subject like sport, English language, music and arts. According to them, school is a closed space where everybody should take a seat, just listen and hide their real personality. The Iranian homeschooling method is not limited to the textbooks and carries on mostly in natural space. It is mainly based on short-term skills, is not time-bounded and is flexible like its global counterparts. The findings show that this kind of education has increased parents' relationship with themselves and their children. Their children are self-adjusted and independent in learning. However, because of the novelty of this kind of education, and its non-legal state, it is not accepted by the society at this stage. Occasionally, the homeschooling children and their parents confront several different challenges including mocking, anxiety about the future of their children etc.",0
A novel tool for evaluating children's musical abilities across age and culture,"The present study introduces a novel tool for assessing musical abilities in children: The Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Musical Abilities (MBEMA). The battery comprises tests of memory, scale, contour, interval, and rhythm, is administered to 245 children in Montreal and 91 in Beijing (Experiment 1), and an abbreviated version is administered to an additional 85 children in Montreal (in less than 20 min.; Experiment 2). All children are 6 to 8 years of age. Their performance indicates that both versions of the MBEMA are sensitive to individual differences and to musical training. The sensitivity of the tests extends to Mandarin-speaking children despite the fact that they show enhanced performance relative to French-speaking children. Because this Chinese advantage is not limited to musical pitch but extends to rhythm and memory, it is unlikely that it results from early exposure to a tonal language. In both cultures and versions of the tests, amount of musical practice predicts performance. Thus, the MBEMA can serve as an objective, short and up-to-date test of musical abilities in a variety of situations, from the identification of children with musical difficulties to the assessment of the effects of musical training in typically developing children of different cultures.",0
"'In one harmonious song combine': Inclusiveness, toleration, and liberty in lady Mary chudleigh's the song of the three children Paraphras'd","This essay examines Lady Mary Chudleigh's Pindaric The Song of the Three Children Paraphras'd (1703) in order to demonstrate how it makes an important contribution to religious, philosophical, and poetic ideas at the turn of the eighteenth century. While Chudleigh's work has recently been associated with nonconformist writing, I argue that it is not so much her ecclesiastical allegiances that are significant as the tolerance and comprehensiveness that her religious position generates. Her poem signals an openness to diverse modes of thought that are incorporated into her vision of the divine. Indeed, the attempt to draw together parts and whole informs the entire texture of Chudleigh's poem, signalling its huge scope and expansive perspective. Chudleigh embraces ideas that range from conservatism to the unorthodox and idiosyncratic in an effort to create an all-encompassing view of shared faith and common purpose, in which all parts connect to the whole that is God's creation. This extends to the choice of text on which her poem is based: the apocryphal Song of the Three Children metonymically links to all moments of thanksgiving across biblical history and beyond, stretching from souls in eternity to those on earth communally uttering the Song in the Anglican church service. In turn, the speaker's voice continually forges a link with those other voices so as to create a collective Christian speaking subject who attempts to involve the reader in its endeavour to bridge the gap between the human and divine. © 2013 The Author.

Poorer verbal working memory for a second language selectively impacts academic achievement in university medical students,"Working memory (WM) is often poorer for a second language (L2). In low noise conditions, people listening to a language other than their first language (L1) may have similar auditory perception skills for that L2 as native listeners, but do worse in high noise conditions, and this has been attributed to the poorer WM for L2. Given that WM is critical for academic success in children and young adults, these speech in noise effects have implications for academic performance where the language of instruction is L2 for a student. We used a well-established Speech-in-Noise task as a verbalWM(vWM) test, and developed a model correlating vWM and measures of English proficiency and/or usage to scholastic outcomes in a multi-faceted assessment medical education program. Significant differences in Speech-Noise Ratio (SNR50) values were observed between medical undergraduates who had learned English before or after five years of age, with the latter group doing worse in the ability to extract whole connected speech in the presence of background multi-talker babble (Student-t tests, p &lt; 0:001). Significant negative correlations were observed between the SNR50 and seven of the nine variables of English usage, learning styles, stress, and musical abilities in a questionnaire administered to the students previously. The remaining two variables, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Age of Acquisition of English (AoAoE) were significantly positively correlated with the SNR50, showing that those with a poorer capacity to discriminate simple English sentences from noise had learnt English later in life and had higher levels of stress, all characteristics of the international students. Local students exhibited significantly lower SNR50 scores and were significantly younger when they first learnt English. No significant correlation was detected between the SNR50 and the students' Visual/Verbal Learning Style.(r=-0:023). Standard multiple regression was carried out to assess the relationship between language proficiency and verbal working memory (SNR50) using 5 variables of L2 proficiency, with the results showing that the variance in SNR50 was significantly predicted by this model .(r2 = 335). Hierarchical multiple regression was then used to test the ability of three independent variable measures (SNR50, age of acquisition of English and English proficiency) to predict academic performance as the dependent variable in a factor analysis model which predicted significant performance differences in an assessment requiring communications skills .p D 0:008/, but not on a companion assessment requiring knowledge of procedural skills, or other assessments requiring factual knowledge. Thus, impaired vWM for an L2 appears to affect specific communications-based assessments in university medical students. © 2013 Mann et al.",0
"Patriotism, nationalism, and national identity in music education: 'O Canada,' how well do we know thee?","The purpose of the study was to determine Canadian secondary school choral students' skill in singing the national anthem. The sample (N = 275) consisted of students from 12 schools, representing six provinces in Canada. Students were audio taped singing 'O Canada' in English, French, or in a combination of both languages and subsequently completed a questionnaire. Results indicated that few students could sing the national anthem perfectly. Although students were significantly more accurate in remembering the lyrics than in singing the melody (p <.0001), only 67% were judged proficient in lyrics whereas a mere 46% were judged proficient in melody. Possible reasons for these poor results include the frequency with which students sing the anthem in secondary schools, the fact that three-quarters named a classroom teacher in the early/elementary years as being the one responsible for teaching them the anthem, the shift to solo versus group singing in public events, and the inconsistency with which music education is delivered in elementary schools. Implications for practice indicate that more emphasis be placed on assisting choir members to sing the anthem accurately, more opportunities be provided in secondary schools for students to sing the anthem, and more curricular attention be placed on teaching students both English and French versions. © The Author(s) 2012.",0
"Semantic triggers, linguistic variation and the mass-count distinction","Although most languages allow nouns to be used with numerals to express cardinality, they differ significantly in how they grammatically encode such expressions. Some languages, like English, require count syntax whereas others, like Mandarin, lack count syntax and typically use classifiers. Here, the chapter asks what appears to be a simple question: how do children determine whether their language makes a distinction between mass and count syntax? This question reveals itself to be subtle and difficult when languages beyond English and Mandarin are considered. The chapter argues that prototypical syntactic and morphological differences between mass-count and classifier languages are not constitutive of this typological difference. The use of classifiers, the combination of numerals with bare nouns, and even plural morphology can occur in both mass-count and classifier languages. As a result, such features cannot be sufficient for determining whether or not a language has count syntax. Instead, the chapter argues that it is the relation of these syntactic structures to their semantic interpretations that differentiates languages and guides acquisition. Only mass-count languages can specify exclusive reference to singularities in absence of classifiers or measure words. © the chapters their several authors 2012. All rights reserved.",0
"Marc Blitzstein: His Life, His Work, His World","This is a study of the life and work of one of America's most brilliant and inspiring composer-dramatists, Marc Blitzstein (1905-1964). A piano student of Alexander Siloti, and composition student of Rosario Scalero, Nadia Boulanger, and Arnold Schoenberg, Blitzstein innovatively combined serious and popular techniques and traditions in order to reach the large audience for radio, film, and Broadway shows, producing work, conditioned by Marxist perspectives, that spoke to the concerns of workers, immigrants, women, and minorities. His most successful works include the operas The Cradle Will Rock (1937) and Regina (1949, adapted from Lillian Hellman's 1939 play, The Little Foxes), for which he wrote both the words and music, and his adaptation of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's The Threepenny Opera, which helped popularize that piece in English-speaking countries, and which yielded the hit song ""Mack the Knife."" Other notable works include the opera No for an Answer, the Airborne Symphony for soloists, chorus, and orchestra, the ballet The Guests, and two late stage works, Reuben Reuben and Juno. Such works had, according to Leonard Bernstein, an ""incalculable"" influence on the American musical theater, and remain particularly noteworthy in terms of their musical prosody, their formal novelty, and their amalgam of serious and popular elements. This study considers other aspects of the composer's life: his Jewish-Russian background and his childhood in Philadelphia; his activities as a pianist, critic, and translator; his marriage to the writer Eva Goldbeck and his relations with friends and colleagues; his involvement with various progressive social causes; his service in the Army as an entertainment specialist during World War II; his brush with anti-communist attacks; and his violent death in Martinique at age fifty-eight. © Oxford University Press 2012.

History and computing: The example of luxembourg,"This geographical and social situation between two important European civilisations explains the particularities of our school system. Besides their own native tongue (Luxembourgish) which became a national language by a law passed in 1984, every Luxembourger has to be able to speak two other languages: German and French. This is one reason why primary education in Luxembourg lasts for 6 years, longer than in many other countries in Europe. It is preceded by 2 years of kindergarten, the second being compulsory. During their 6 years of primary education children study German, French, elementary mathematics, the history of Luxembourg, the geography of Luxembourg and the surrounding European countries, and several other subjects including physical education, music or religion. After a national test taken at the age of 12, the pupils must choose between three types of school, Etudes secondaires, Etudes secondaires techniques or Enseignement comph~mentaire. Courses at the Etudes secondaires (grammar schools) last for 7 years and prepare pupils mainly for university studies. Courses at the Etudes secondaires techniques (secondary technical schools) lead to different qualifications, one of which, also after 7 years, allows access to Polytechnics or Technical Colleges. Pupils who do not qualify for these two types of school attend the enseignement complementaire from the age of 12 to 15 when compulsory schooling ends. © 1997 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) Amsterdam B.V.

"Militant prologues, memory, and models of masculinity in Shakespeare’s Henry V and Troilus and Cressida","In The Pleasure of the Text, Roland Barthes invokes ""the children’s game of topping hands"" as a figure for the textual layering of significance: ""the excitement comes not from a processive haste but from a kind of vertical din (the verticality of language and of its destruction); it is at the moment when each (different) hand skips over the next (and not one after the other) that the hole, the gap, is created and carries off the subject of the game-the subject of the text.""1 This formulation interests me for two reasons: first, because Barthes understands the process to be one of skipping over rather than succession, and second, because he locates ""the subject of the text"" in this gap, in a voided space that exists between. This chapter is about the speaking position of the militantly masculine Shakespearean chorus, a figure that occupies a liminal temporal and spatial position, a position between.2 The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""liminal"" as pertaining to a threshold; a liminal space is transitional or indeterminate, and a subject occupies it only temporarily. During this circumscribed time and in this circumscribed space, the choral figure transmits the subject of the play-or the ""necessary question of the play,"" (3.2.42) as Hamlet puts it-by directly addressing his audience. © Jennifer Feather and Catherine E.

Voices of play: Miskitu Children’s speech and song on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua,"While indigenous languages have become prominent in global political and educational discourses, limited attention has been given to indigenous children s everyday communication. ""Voices of Play ""is a study of multilingual play and performance among Miskitu children growing up on Corn Island, part of a multi-ethnic autonomous region on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. Corn Island is historically home to Afro-Caribbean Creole people, but increasing numbers of Miskitu people began moving there from the mainland during the Contra War, and many Spanish-speaking mestizos from western Nicaragua have also settled there. Miskitu kids on Corn Island often gain some competence speaking Miskitu, Spanish, and Kriol English. As the children of migrants and the first generation of their families to grow up with television, they develop creative forms of expression that combine languages and genres, shaping intercultural senses of belonging. ""Voices of Play"" is the first ethnography to focus on the interaction between music and language in children s discourse. Minks skillfully weaves together Latin American, North American, and European theories of culture and communication, creating a transdisciplinary dialogue that moves across intellectual geographies. Her analysis shows how music and language involve a wide range of communicative resources that create new forms of belonging and enable dialogue across differences. Miskitu children s voices reveal the intertwining of speech and song, the emergence of self and other, and the centrality of aesthetics to social struggle. © 2013, The Arizona Board of Regents.

Prominence matching in English songs: A historical perspective,"The primary source of linguistic evidence in reconstructing stress systems is provided by metered poetry, particularly by meters that control the matching of the linguistic stress to metrical strong positions. For Middle English, the distribution of lexical stress across the weak/strong patterns of iambic pentameter, from Chaucer to Shakespeare, has provided important clues for linguistic analysis. In addition to spoken poetry, songs provide another type of metered poetry from that period. However, they have not been exploited as a source of metrical or linguistic evidence. The present paper takes a tentative step towards filling this gap, by focusing on a diachronic study of prominence mismatching. © 2013 UNED.",0

The role of universal constraints in language acquisition,"We propose to automate the field of language acquisition evaluation through Constraint Solving; in particular through the use of Womb Grammars. Womb Grammar Parsing is a novel constraint based paradigm that was devised mainly to induce grammatical structure from the description of its syntactic constraints in a related language. In this paper we argue that based on universal constraints it is also ideal for automating the evaluation of language acquisition, and present as proof of concept a CHRG system for detecting which of fourteen levels of morphological proficiency a child is at, from a representative sample of the child's expressions. Our results also uncover ways in which the linguistic constraints that characterize a grammar need to be tailored to language acquisition applications. We also put forward a proposal for discovering in what order such levels are typically acquired in other languages than English. Our findings have great potential practical value, in that they can help educators tailor the games, stories, songs, etc. that can aid a child (or a second language learner) to progress in timely fashion into the next level of proficiency, and can as well help shed light on the processes by which languages less studied than English are acquired. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",0
Sofiero - Palatial garden with a modal tune,"In 1905, the Swedish Crown Prince and his wife received Sofiero Palatial Garden as a wedding gift. The park was in a state of neglect but with great skill, energy and passion the royal couple succeeded in transforming it into an 'English garden' that retains its special character to this day. Sofiero at that time displayed strong contrasts in scenery because of its original conception. The Park is open to visitors today. The material presented here is mostly based on own observations and the conversations I have had during my three-month long sojourn with various visitors and employees of the park. I have paid special attention to the people's bodily attitude to the park rather than the fact of being in it. The study describes and analyses what signification the park may possess for people's lives. From a phenomenological perspective, I study not only how people dwell in the park but also how the park, with its renowned style and musical mode, resonates in them. The contents of the park are characterized by its melodious form, a modal tune created by a central tonality, in itself originating from the relations of notes within the scale. Thanks to these unanticipated, atonal dissonances the overall quality ofthe experience is enhanced. Thus, this feeling of transition does not prompt losing touch with the existent primary tone and melody. The material presented here also shows how the visitor are able to capture the musical mood of the park, and how it stirs reflection on existential queries that often embrace tension between determinism and freedom; in short, a feeling of being in the world, of existence. The witness-reports suggest the experience of temporality and transience: how this feeling is not only connected to space but also to time, to the past, present and future, to how things were, how they are now and how they might come to be.",0
Teaching english at the lower primary school level using songs,"When teaching English in the first five years of primary school, it is very important to consider specific cognitive and developmental characteristic of learners. In this period, songs are very close to children. They like to sing them and are fond of moving. That is why songs are very useful and welcome in teaching English. Songs motivate learners; they learn new words, phrases and grammar. Songs are very helpful with pronunciation and make learning fun during the class. The main aim of this research was to find out why teachers use songs in class, how many songs they plan to use in a school year, what kind of activities they add to songs and what are the positive and the negative sides of teaching English with songs. In addition to that, we strived to find out the difference between English teachers and Class teachers who teach English in the first five years of primary school. The findings of our research show that there is not a great difference between them. However there is a small difference in teaching English language in the first or second period of primary school. Teachers often use songs to motivate learners and teach them new content.",0
Onomatopoeia as phenomenon of iconicity,"The heterogeneity of onomatopoeic phenomena in language leads to considerable problems with their definitions. The presented paper contains an attempt to build a terminological hierarchy and make a terminological distinction in onomatopoeia. The criterion for the differentiation of onomatopoeia and sound symbolism is involuntary phonetically motivated connection between word forms and acoustic characteristics of the referent. This criterion is used to define the place of border phenomena (such as animal Phonation, injections to lure or frighten off animals, imitative singing, verbs denoting movement which include acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, lexemes related to facial expressions in general etc.) in the onomatopoeic system of the language. The paper presents an example of a German root klack that can be traced back to a common Germanic onomatopoeic root and has etymologically and phonologically similar forms in all Indo-European languages. With the help of etymological analysis the paper proves that a much larger part of vocabulary is onomatopoeic in origin than could have been anticipated. Onomatopoeic word stems have significant word-forming and semantic productivity. Parallel sound combinations with similar semantics in Indo-European languages show the development of complex semantic structures with completely demotivated meanings based on primary auditory sensation.",0
Home and community factors influencing bilingual children's ethnic language vocabulary development,"The influence of home and community factors in predicting ethnic or heritage language vocabulary were examined among 282 Singaporean children whose ethnic languages (or mother tongues) were Chinese, Malay, or Tamil, and who were also learning English. The results indicated that (1) parents speaking ethnic language to children had a strong positive effect on children's ethnic language vocabulary, whereas parents speaking only English had a negative effect; (2) language community had an effect on children's ethnic language vocabulary, which may reflect community support for the language among the broader community; (3) family income worked differently depending on the language community; and (4) watching television in English mostly/only had a negative effect on children's ethnic language vocabulary. These findings lend support to other studies among language-minority children indicating that maintaining an ethnic or heritage language requires home support when schooling is through a societally dominant language. © The Author(s) 2012.",0

Developing adult English language learners' vocabulary skills through children's rhymes and songs,"This paper reports the effects of using children's rhymes and songs on developing adult English language learners' comprehension and production vocabulary skills. The focus of this study was to investigate the effects of children's rhymes and songs on vocabulary comprehension and production skills. Forty-five adult English language learners were instructed and trained in some vocabulary skills through a suggested vocabulary program based on children's rhymes and songs developed by the writer. A vocabulary test was developed and used as a pre-post test. The effectiveness of the training program was measured by comparing the participants' scores on the pre-post test and applying the modified gain ratio. The results of the pre- and post-tests indicated statistically significant differences favoring the post-test. The suggested program proved to be effective in developing the participants' comprehension and production vocabulary skills as shown by the vocabulary gain scores, which were consistently higher on the post test.",0
Indian English nursery rhymes: Bridging the gap between L1 and L2 education,"The paper examines the emergence of popular L1 English nursery rhymes in India. Indian culture, like other Asian cultures, emphasizes relationship building, respecting others and knowing one's position in the great macrocosm of nature and society. Nursery rhymes in L1 Hindi (a national language of India) develop these factors in the Indian child. English L1 nursery rhymes, however popular they might be, showcase a society and culture from which the Indian child is far removed. A cultural disparity is evident when one compares L1 English and L1 Hindi nursery rhymes. Parents in India are increasingly relying on L2 English nursery rhymes which reflect the images that a child can easily assimilate from the day-to-day world. The child can easily relate to what he or she is learning (due to the common gender of the child, gendered pronouns like 'him' will not be used) when the sociocultural elements, which form an important part of the Indian ethos, are incorporated in L2 English acquisition. © 2012 IUP.",0
Estimating the effectiveness and feasibility of a game-based project for early foreign language learning,"This paper outlines the rationale for and the purpose of designing and implementing a project aiming to make very young EFL learners develop their language skills through their involvement in interactive psychomotor activities. The project, which is a part of a broader longitudinal project having introduced EFL in the first primary school grade, was implemented in two 2nd grade Greek classrooms with a total of 44 seven year old children. Multisensory teaching was followed through the use of a combination of activities: classroom creative activities included memory and word games, drawings, constructions, role-play games, pantomime as well as songs. In the gym, children participated in physical activities such as races, chases and hopscotch as well as dance and music activities, with the aim to improve their oral communicative skills and creativity. In order to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of the project, an evaluation study was conducted by using a pre- and post- language test and journals kept by the teachers. It was evident that the project had a positive effect on developing very young learners' language skills, and on enhancing their motivation to participate in psychomotor activities.",0
English songs as means of aiding students' proficiency development,"The major aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of using songs in teaching English language to primary school students. This research will specifically investigate to what extent songs can contribute to the development of students' language proficiency. The research is designed to find out whether using songs can be an effective way in creating positive attitude and motivation in language learners. The research will be carried out through the use of questionnaire. The data will be analyzed using the SPSS software to determine the best statistical technique to be used to test the hypotheses and to interpret the result. This is a preliminary survey research and it is hoped that this research will give an opportunity to teachers to realize songs help improve students' language proficiency. From the survey, it has been discovered that the use of song not only helps the understanding, it also stimulates and increases the students' interest to learn, enjoy and engage in the learning process. Furthermore, it accelerates students' confidence, learning ability and skill when activities are highly motivated and memorable. Future researchers should extend this research to other samples in other localities and cultures.",0
Acupuncture for cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy (CP) has been defined as a disorder affecting body movement, motor skills and postural control. It is caused by damage to the developing fetal or infant brain during pregnancy, at birth or during the first 3-5 years of life. Patients with CP often seek out CAM treatments, such as acupuncture. The objective of this study was to examine the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture for CP. Four databases (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, EMBASE and MEDLINE) were searched for RCTs and systematic reviews (SRs) of acupuncture and CP. Titles and abstracts were screened; articles meeting the selection criteria were retrieved in full. Studies were included if they were SRs or RCTs and evaluated the effectiveness of an acupoint stimulation technique in children with CP. Only English and Chinese language papers were included. The search identified seven studies; six RCTs and one quasi-RCT that included acupuncture in at least one group. Three of the RCTs compared different types of acupuncture, while four compared acupuncture to another active intervention, including osteopathy, massage, music and play. The evidence of safety and effectiveness for acupuncture and cerebral palsy is difficult to interpret due to poor reporting. When the effectiveness of a treatment is unknown, data about its safety are paramount. With regards to paediatric needle acupuncture, there is reasonable evidence to suggest that it is safe in trained hands. However, the safety of acupoint injection is unknown, particularly when foreign proteins are being injected. © 2012 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.",0
Intervention in an immigrant schoolchild with an interdisciplinary programme of music and language to help his linguistic development,"The case is presented of a six-year-old child of Bulgarian origin, with serious language problems, both oral and reading-writing skills, as well as problems with social interaction and communication stemming from them. The intervention consisted of nine sessions in an interdisciplinary programme to work simultaneously with the areas of language and music in a complementary manner with the whole class group. The main objective of the intervention was to encourage the child's communication, comprehension, speaking and writing in Spanish, in order to improve his linguistic development. © 2012 AELFA.

Profiles in Bilingualism: Factors Influencing Kindergartners' Language Proficiency,"Three common assumptions concerning bilingual children's language proficiency are: (1) their proficiency in two languages is usually unbalanced; (2) low socioeconomic status (SES) indicates low proficiency in both languages; and (3) encouraging parents to speak some societal language at home will promote its development. Examining the vocabulary scores of 282 bilingual Singaporean kindergartners (167 Chinese, 70 Malay, and 45 Tamil), the current study found that these young children were evenly divided among four language profiles: strong in ethnic language (Chinese, Malay or Tamil) or English, strong in both languages, or weak in both. Children with high proficiency in both languages were proportionally represented in the low, middle and high SES groups, demonstrating the achievability of strong vocabulary in two languages for children of different SES. However, low SES children were most at risk for low proficiency in both languages, although many achieved high proficiency in ethnic language or both. Middle and high SES children were most likely to demonstrate low ethnic language with high English proficiency. Children mostly exposed to one language from different sources generally showed strength in that language. Children exposed to both languages at home were most likely to show low proficiency in both languages, although plenty of children exposed to both languages developed high proficiency in English or both. These results affirm previous findings that SES and home language exposure influence bilingual children's proficiency. Implications include the importance of teachers assessing bilingual children's proficiency in both languages and collaborating with parents to develop bilingual children's vocabulary. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",0
Male singing in early years of school,"The sociological experience of singing for boys may differ significantly once the boy’s personal history; socio-economic status; his parent’s education and their religious beliefs are taken into account. My work with boys has been in Australia in a non-religious format and in the United Kingdom in the cradle of western musical and religious tradition. The primary difference is that the boys in English choir schools (such as Westminster Abbey or St Paul’s Cathedral) often come from backgrounds where parents: have a university education; have been exposed to Christian practices; have an understanding and appreciation of the history of the English choral tradition and classical music; and enjoy a mid to high level of economic stability. The boys I worked with in Australia came from a much wider range of backgrounds and, as religion was not integral to the programme I was teaching, parents chose this program over others offered in the community that did have a religious foundation. I was also the first girl chorister in my local cathedral choir in Australia. It started out because my father sang in the choir and my parents were active in the parish community. Sociologically speaking, the rise of the girl chorister in churches in both Australia and England is fascinating. Where has this left boys? What impact has the introduction of girls had on the recruitment of boy choristers? Are girls the way of the future as they keep their voices longer?. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",0
Josip Mantuani: Between art history and musicology,"We know Josip Mantuani as one of the doyens of Slovenian art history and the founder of Slovenian musicology, with a very rich bibliography, but he was also one of the protagonists of art-historical and archaeological studies when the University of Ljubljana was first established. After graduating from high school in Ljubljana, he studied at the University of Vienna, focusing especially on art history. He completed his university studies in 1894 with a dissertation entitled über die Kleinkunst und Kunstgewerbe des X. und Beginns des XI. Jahrhunderts under Riegel's mentorship. At the same time, Mantuani studied composition with Josef Böm and Anton Bruckner. He never developed into a composer, but he did develop an interest in the history of music. In 1893, he began working at the Hofbibliothek (Imperial Library), where he soon became the curator of the music collection in the manuscript department; when the music collection was reorganised and became independent in 1898, he took over its management and remained at this post until his departure for Ljubljana in 1909. Guido Adler, one of the leading musicologists of his time in the German-speaking world, invited Mantuani to cooperate on the series Die Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich, which he did with the critical edition of Jacobus Gallus' Opus Musicum. In this period, he also wrote several other important musicological and art-historical works. Mantuani was off ered the position of Director of the Regional Museum of Carniola early on, but moved from Vienna to Ljubljana only in 1909. After some initial problems, Mantuani enthusiastically set to work, of which there was no shortage at what was the main professional institution for virtually all fields in Carniola at the time. One of his more prominent initial projects was the arrangement and re-establishment of an independent painting collection. At the same time, he was also very active in the musical life in Ljubljana. In view of all these achievements, it is not surprising that he was invited to become a lecturer at the first Slovenian University in Ljubljana, which was established in 1919. Together with Izidor Cankar, who was assistant professor and thus the chair, Josip Mantuani started lecturing in 1920 as an adjunct professor for older art history, archaeology and epigraphy. He remained at this post until the 1923/1924 school year, when he retired as Director of the National Museum and stopped lecturing. The relationship between Mantuani and his younger colleagues was not friendly, as best evidenced by Mole's complaints that Mantuani hindered his access to artefacts at the National Museum, where he held the seminar for his students. After his retirement in 1924, he was again more strongly drawn to the history of music. It was at this time that he began to prepare more extensive musicological works, which is also documented in his correspondence with Adler; unfortunately, however, all his plans were cut short by his death in 1933.",0
"Sex, gender and singing development: Making a positive difference to boys’ singing through a national programme in England","The chapter reports evidence to suggest that children’s singing is characterised by both sex and gender differences. Sex differences are evidenced in the relative size of the vocal anatomy and physiology, with boys tending to have slightly larger vocal instruments compared to girls throughout childhood. Gender differences are evidenced in the ways that such sex differences are reflected in the socio-cultural shaping of children’s developing vocal behaviours over time. Girls tend to be relatively more accomplished in their singing than boys at an earlier age in Western cultures, but there are also diverse cultural examples (such as in the UK, Afghanistan and South Africa) where there are strong traditions of accomplished boys’ singing. For both sexes, highly skilled singing is more likely to be evidenced where selected children participate in an extensive programme of singing development, such as offered by the Cathedral choirs in the UK since the first millennium. Within the chapter, gender similarities and differences are illustrated by data from three longitudinal studies, one in Italy and two in England, including an ongoing evaluation of the English National Singing Programme Sing Up. In the latter study, data analyses based on the sung products of approximately 10,000 individual children indicate that those with successful experience of the programme - both girls and boys - tend to be significantly more developed in their singing competency than those outside the programme. However, gender differences persist in both groups in favour of girls, although these are mediated by age and experience. When questioned about their attitudes to singing, clear gender differences also emerged, with girls tending to be more positive than boys, although again with age as a mediating factor, with younger children of both sexes generally more positive than older children. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of appropriate educational experience in addressing these general trends is evidenced by examples of individual schools where boys are at least as successful as their female peers, and demonstrate equally positive attitudes to singing. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",0
Nationalism and patriotism: The experience of an Indian diaspora in South Africa,"Beginning in 1948, the Nationalist Government in South Africa enacted laws to define and enforce racial segregation. South Africa's apartheid system was formalized and entrenched systematically through laws of the National Party, a white party comprising primarily Afrikaners, which came into power in that year. Apartheid policies affected every sphere of South African life from marriage and freedom of movement to education. The Group Areas Act No. 41 of 1950 forced a division between races by creating separate residential areas. This facilitated the National Party's implementation of privileged education for white Afrikaners and for their English-speaking white counterparts. This chapter provides insights into the political and social background of the apartheid era in South Africa. The inequities of educational funding among the different racial groups are highlighted. Against this backdrop, the narrative shifts to a personal one that represents similar experiences of Indian children in many “Indian” schools throughout the country. The compulsory singing of the Afrikaner National Anthem, “Die Stem van Suid Afrika,” in all schools in South Africa is illustrated. This anthem, sung in Afrikaans, which was then considered the language of the oppressor by the majority of nonwhite South Africans, articulated Afrikaner nationalism, and white patriotism. This personal narrative extends to the college experience of Indian students in a politically-charged educational environment. This progresses to a discussion of the inner turmoil of teaching in a segregated “Indian” school system. These experiences combined with the dramatic political and social changes of the 1990s in South Africa, inform the reconciliation of my own identity with feelings of nationalistic pride and patriotism towards South Africa. © David G.

"Claiming youth, the modern feminine self, and womanhood in Northern Namibia","Linda, a thirteen-year-old girl, pointing out one picture in her small photo album, told me, ""Th is is me. I was the Miss XXX Primary School last year."" In the picture, she had a shy smile on her face, as she stood wearing a long white dress, a sash with the title ""Miss XXX Primary School"" over her shoulder, and a cute little tiara on her head. Indeed, one of the most striking phenomena I encountered while conducting my fieldwork in northern Namibia was the overwhelming interest in, and frequency of, beauty pageants. Following the model of Miss Universe, Miss Africa, Miss Malaika, and Miss Namibia, ""Miss Something"" contests were taking place in various diff erent public spaces in towns and villages; educational institutions such as colleges, universities, and even primary schools; and bars. This chapter focuses on the life experiences of young Owambo women of Namibia in southern Africa to consider emergent identities in relation to local and transnational ideas about femininity and youth. Ideas about ""modern"" Namibian beauty and femininity, targeting young unmarried women, are constantly displayed in public spaces through the images embodied in the events such as beauty pageants and in the media, including South African and American female magazines and soap operas on television. Th ese images have a significant influence on the young Namibian women's perceptions of contemporary youth. But young Namibian women do not simply imitate Euro-American trends. Instead, they use ""modern"" images to reinterpret, negotiate, and reconfigure their identities and personhood in a local environment so as to increase their autonomy in ways that ultimately do not challenge the prevailing social structure. I argue here that young Owambo women use fashion and clothing to mark a new generational status as youth, an emerging life stage involving autonomy from matrilineal and family obligations, in which they use transnational fashion, music, and so on to construct individual selves. Ultimately, however, the distinction between autonomous youth, who identify with transnational consumer culture, and traditional Owambo feminine roles is more apparent than real. Female youth can postpone marriage and have children before marriage without significantly threatening the social fabric because in matrilineal Owambo society the status of children is tied to the mother's lineage, not to the father's lineage. Furthermore, autonomous female youth who mature into women with an independent income or children (or both) can gain a certain form of social respect without marrying under the condition that they satisfy kinship and communal responsibilities. Th us, as Piot (1999) argues, modernity and tradition may be imagined as opposed states, but in fact, modernity is defined and constituted in local terms. The Owambo are Namibia's largest ethnic group. Most Owambo live in the north-central part of the country, the area formerly called ""Owamboland,"" which extends from the north of the Etosha Pan to the Angolan border. North-central Namibia makes up only 10 percent of the surface of the country but holds nearly half of the national population (2.08 million as of 2007). Until the late nineteenth century, north-central Namibia was divided into a series of independent kingdoms and communities, controlled by Owambo kings or chiefs. Between 1884 and 1915, Namibia, then known as South West Africa, became a German colony. Th e Union of South Africa invaded South West Africa at the request of the British government during World War I. Later, in 1921, Namibia was handed to South Africa under the terms of a League of Nations mandate formulated by the Allied powers. The South African regime continued until the country's independence in March 1990. Agriculture and animal herding are still the main economic activities among the majority of people, but wage labor among young people has been another major economic activity since the establishment of a migrant and contract labor system in the colonial economy. I have discussed elsewhere how the transformation of the ohango ritual from a female initiation ceremony to a wedding through the Christianization of the communities significantly extended the ""youth"" phase for Owambo women (Yamakawa 2007). In the past, the ohango was only for females. Parents let their daughters participate in the ohango soon aft er they reached puberty, although timing depended on the family's economic fortunes. Aft er the girls went through the ceremony, they were recognized as mature and marriageable. Boys, however, could attain such a status only when they had economic resources such as livestock and a homestead. Hence, prior to Christianization, the period between childhood and adulthood for Owambo women was much shorter than for men. In contrast, the ohango practice today, which transforms the ohango from a puberty ritual to a wedding and involves both sexes, has the eff ect of launching both young women and young men into an extended youth phase that is not defined in terms of biological age. To be a youth means to have, to a certain extent, more autonomy and freedom than children but to have fewer social responsibilities than adults. Th ese changes have created a space for young unmarried females to experiment with lifestyle options in an extended youth phase, instead of becoming a wife and mother soon aft er puberty. Women now also have greater access to wage labor since the colonial system of requiring people who wished to leave the village to get a permit has ended. In the past, most such permits were granted to men involved in contract labor, and few women could attain permits. In contemporary Namibia, increasing numbers of youth, even those youth lacking the economic resources and information to fully realize their desires, define self through consumption of cosmopolitan youth culture. Individuals use what is available to create an individual style to claim personal and social position. Individuals are required to manifest ""taste"" that both expresses a unique personality and is deeply intertwined with social, economic, and political spheres. Taste, therefore, produces social distinctions and plays a key role in reproducing social structure (Bourdieu 1984). For female youth in northern Namibia, for instance, wearing particular brand-name clothes, speaking ""good"" English in addition to one's mother tongue, watching certain television programs (especially South African soap operas or ones from South American countries), as well as having a good command of local activities such as cooking food and pounding millet can all be significant items for creating a specific youth style and identity. Young Namibians are similar to other South African youth in defining self by combining local and transnational goods to create a unique personal style. Dolby's (2000) study of urban high school youth in postapartheid South Africa demonstrates how youth employ particular ""tastes"" in global culture, such as music and clothes, to negotiate their racial identity in order to redefine the self and to make ethnicity meaningful for them. Similarly, Salo (2003) discusses the intergenerational tensions between consumer-driven youth cultures and local social and moral gender norms in postapartheid South Africa. Cosmopolitan youth style encourages youth to conceptualize their identity in terms of an imagined global space and to place less importance on ethnic divisions that are very important to adults. Piot (1999) argues that despite their lack of material and economic resources, some youth decide to go beyond local norms at the cost of jeopardizing social relations and networks that have a greater impact on their destiny in local society. I found similar patterns in rural Namibia. In postapartheid Namibia, ""taste"" and consumption go hand in hand, constituting one of the important means for constructing young people's racial and ethnic, generational, and gender identities. Music and arts as well as fashion and clothing appear to have specific class and generational connotations among the youth as their expression of selfh ood and also of generational consciousness. Young Namibians have spent most of their lives in an independent Namibia where they are not required to fight and where they have basic human rights, receive education, and have greater exposure to foreign influences than did their parents.

Music in the teaching and learning of english,"Music, including song, represents a language of sounds, rhythms, feelings and emotions, which can be easily integrated with other academic areas, making it an important resource for acquiring new knowledge. This means that subjects like English could benefit from the advantages of music, and vice versa. Therefore, collaborative work between music teachers and English teachers is very important. In our project we studied the collaborative work between teachers of music and English, with the principle objective of developing high quality musical and English skills, in order to favour both subject areas and affect the education of the students. A survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire. The principle aim was to ascertain what the teachers of both subjects do in their classrooms. The survey was also used to establish whether music teachers use English correctly and whether English teachers use music correctly. The information obtained tells us that collaborative work between professionals in both fields can result in much more satisfactory outcomes. Such collaborations could improve educational quality and consequently facilitate learning. Therefore, we conclude that there is a need for a second phase of this project, which will be carried out during the next academic term, with the design and implementation of a programme of intervention in which professionals in both areas will work collaboratively. There will be two groups (an experimental group and a control group) and two tests. One pre-test and one post-test will be given to both groups to verify whether there are significant differences between the pupils of the groups in each subject. The test will also help to determine whether the intervention was successful or not. It will be implemented in several primary and secondary schools in Granada, Ceuta and Melilla. © Common Ground, María Amaya Epelde, Julia Bernal, Miguel Angel Gallardo-Vigil, África Rodríguez.",0
You know what it is: Learning words through listening to hip-hop,"Music listeners have difficulty correctly understanding and remembering song lyrics. However, results from the present study support the hypothesis that young adults can learn African-American English (AAE) vocabulary from listening to hip-hop music. Non-African-American participants first gave free-response definitions to AAE vocabulary items, after which they answered demographic questions as well as questions addressing their social networks, their musical preferences, and their knowledge of popular culture. Results from the survey show a positive association between the number of hip-hop artists listened to and AAE comprehension vocabulary scores. Additionally, participants were more likely to know an AAE vocabulary item if the hip-hop artists they listen to use the word in their song lyrics. Together, these results suggest that young adults can acquire vocabulary through exposure to hip-hop music, a finding relevant for research on vocabulary acquisition, the construction of adolescent and adult identities, and the adoption of lexical innovations. © 2011 Paula Chesley.",0
Discovering and affirming musical identity through extracurricular music-making in English secondary schools,"For well over fifty years, a defining characteristic of English secondary school music education has been its extracurricular activities-those collective musical endeavors undertaken voluntarily, outside the school day, by students and staff with a particular enthusiasm for music. Historically, these have included orchestras, choirs, and musical productions, with opportunities later broadening in response to changing musical and school cultures, to encompass samba groups, ""battle of the bands"" contests, and music technology clubs. Often these extracurricular experiences become the most vividly recalled memories of music in school, and they can lay the foundations for continued participation in adulthood. They are therefore a valuable focus for research, offering insight on the opportunities beyond the curriculum that shape young people's understanding of what music is, and whether it is for them. In a study of musically active British adults' recollections of their formative musical experiences, the challenges and successes of extracurricular music emerged as the most prominent factor in lifelong musical interest and activity (Pitts 2008). Written responses from over seventy adults illustrated the ways in which friendships, teacher influence, and the acquisition of musical skills and identity were closely intertwined: Middle school ensembles [ages nine-thirteen] always went to music festivals, usually doing well, and school concerts were always very well prepared and good fun. There was an inter-form competition each year where each form [grade level] had to put together a program including a few solos and a whole form piece. All of this was run by one very energetic music teacher who sadly died last year. I had seen her the previous year and both her and her husband (my piano teacher) had always been keen to hear about my progress as well as that of almost all the other pupils she would have known. Over three hundred attended the funeral and she will be greatly missed. [Life history study, respondent 51, age twenty-nine] This description is representative of many similar accounts of tireless and much-loved music teachers providing opportunities for instrumentalists and singers in their schools, and shows how the teacher's musical identity, as much as their students', is manifest in collective musical activity beyond the classroom. Gordon Cox (1999) has shown through interviews with teachers that the satisfaction of using and developing their own musical skills, as well as providing opportunities for their students, helps teachers to retain their identities as musicians as well as educators. By doing so, they present valuable role models for their students, communicating inclusive values for music by revealing and modeling the processes of musical learning. If that all sounds too idealistic, it must indeed be acknowledged that not all children are fortunate in having such nurturing experiences of extracurricular music. Even among the musically active adults involved in my life histories study, some had retained memories of disappointments and missed opportunities: The first music teacher I encountered [at grammar school] was a rather forbidding character, and at eleven years old I felt rather nervous of him. The whole class was auditioned for the school choir, taking pupils two at a time. I was not accepted, much to my great disappointment. This must have had quite a negative impact on me because I did not try again through all the years I was at the school. [Life history study, respondent 13, age fifty-eight] Perhaps the greatest drawback of extracurricular music-making is that it typically involves a small proportion of a school population, often selected through audition. This selection process means that those who had wanted to join in but have been denied access can suffer a serious blow to their musical confidence. Similarly problematic are the cases where students are eager for musical opportunities, but those provided within the school are insufficient for their needs, thus creating a disjunction between the musical identity that is nurtured by parents and instrumental teachers, but that appears invisible within the school context: In the senior school the standard of music was very high but I was disappointed that the head of music seemed only interested in children who learned instruments in school and I was never allowed to play in assembly like them and I felt, rightly or wrongly, that my music was inferior. [ . . . ] It was only in the last three years at school when I learned the double bass there that I felt part of school music as the teacher was very encouraging. [Life history study, respondent 17, age sixty-five] The experiences reported here of failing the choir audition and not being allowed to play in assembly share the common characteristic of seeking (and not finding) a teacher's recognition of an already emerging musical expertise and interest. While both of these adults have subsequently pursued their musical activities elsewhere, it is clear that the school music teacher was an important potential source of affirmation, and that the denial of his or her approval caused them to doubt either themselves or the value of school music provision. Music teachers might be felt to have enough pressures to face without feeling responsible for the confidence and future involvement of their students-but perhaps this is in fact their most fundamental responsibility, and should be at the heart of curriculum and extracurricular decisions. In order to explore this further, I turn now to some contemporary accounts of extracurricular musical involvement, focusing in particular on the musical values and attitudes that are communicated through the teacher's role in different extracurricular settings. © 2011 by Indiana University Press All rights reserved.",0
"Diversity, identity, and learning styles among students in a Brazilian university","One of the main characteristics of music-making in Brazilian society is that it encompasses a myriad of cultures, traditions, genres, and musical styles, which vary considerably from region to region. In addition to this rich historical legacy, the roles of music in contemporary society are being affected by rapid transformations occurring in the last few decades, particularly with the expansion of the music industry. However, the Brazilian education system has not addressed these changes with the same speed. In particular, the Brazilian School of Music is confined within a traditional system from a European heritage, based on the French conservatoire. Brazilian Schools of Music have been changing slowly, but not necessarily speedily enough to address the growing diversity of aspiring music students' backgrounds and educational needs. Since the foundation of the first Music School in Brazil, the teaching model has valued the canons of Western classical music, and the acquisition of specific skills such as reading and writing in traditional notation has been a condition of musicianship. For many years, students wishing to pursue a music career at the university had to come ""with a strong musical background, obtained in most cases in private schools, since there is no compulsory music education program in primary and secondary schools"" (Hentschke and Souza 2004: 103). Entrance to Music School was conditional on passing a demanding exam in which the candidates had to demonstrate that they had a good basis in musical theory, sight-reading, and dictation, and a good level of performance when playing classical music on their instruments. Students with other interests and experiences had no chance of gaining entry because they could not fit into the traditional mold of the conservatoire system. As a result, it was almost impossible for students from alternative backgrounds to get a place at university (Hentschke and Souza 2004: 103). Recently some changes have occurred due to government guidelines which implemented a huge process of curriculum reform at universities in Brazil. This introduced a process in which the curriculum has more optional courses and fewer compulsory ones. Moreover, the guidelines advocated that some changes should be made in the entrance exam in order to increase the number of students at universities in all subjects. Following this proposed flexibility in the curriculum and the changes to the entrance exam, the number of students looking for a degree at a Music School has been increasing, and it now includes students with experience in popular music. As a result, students in Brazilian higher education come from mixed backgrounds, and this means that they have learned music through different processes. Some students have been trained solely in a classical way, which implies that they have received formal training, whereas others have had experience of informal musical practices through popular music; and others come from a mixture of these backgrounds. It follows from this that Music Schools have two challenges. The first concerns knowing how to cope with the profile of a student who comes from a background of popular music, since this includes differences in attitudes, values, beliefs, and behavior, as well as musical skills and knowledge, and different educational needs. The second is a consequence of the first and involves rethinking the objectives of the Music School so that they are in tune with the exigencies of life in the twenty-first century. Thus it is crucial to have a discussion about students' identities and to become aware of their views, conflicts, and expectations as well as the kinds of skills and knowledge used when learning music. This chapter considers the musical identities of students in one Brazilian university Music School, taking into account three different types of background: those who have experienced only classical training, those who have acquired their skills and knowledge mostly through informal learning experiences, and those whose backgrounds contain a mixture of formal and informal learning. The different identities of classical and popular music students, and of those from both types of background, are examined in relation to their different sets of musical values, skills, and knowledge acquired through their formal and informal backgrounds. The musical identities of the students are related to their course choices at the university (either a bachelor's degree course or a music education course), since groups enrolled in different courses acquire particular identities related to the piano, singing, guitar, string, wind, conducting, composition, and music education. Finally, I will consider the role and influence of the Music School environment in shaping and changing students' musical identities. The discussion is based on findings from a qualitative research study using an ethnographic approach. The research examined students' attitudes toward learning, which implied also understanding their values, beliefs, behavior and identities. The study dealt with 75 first-year students. Among those participants, 40 students were interviewed in detail, and these were divided according to their backgrounds as follows: 7 popular music students, 13 classical, 20 mixed (12 with more emphasis on popular music, and 8 with more emphasis on classical music). Questionnaires and observation were also used. In understanding students' attitudes toward learning at Music School, there is a need to reflect upon new perspectives and possibly offer ideas to change the current approach. © 2011 by Indiana University Press All rights reserved.",0
Using SIR-KR English teaching model to increase students' English vocabulary size,"In view of students' love for music and singing, the researcher integrated music with English learning by means of technology. The participants were 28 Aboriginal students in an Aboriginal high school in southern Taiwan. According to the purpose of the study, the research was about designing an English teaching model (SIR-KR) and exploring the issues of: (1) the principles in designing an online singing platform, (2) the effect of the platform in terms of increasing students' vocabulary size. Collected data included ten revised English songs, vocabulary recognition test sheet, and student's responses to the online singing platform. The data was computed and analyzed by means of descriptive analyses and paired samples t-test. The pre and posttest of their vocabulary size were analyzed quantitatively while the subjects' responses to the online singing platform were analyzed qualitatively. The findings of the study are: (1) The subjects' vocabulary size had increased to reach statistic level after the experiment. (2) All the students showed positive attitudes toward the effectiveness of the teaching model. The results of this study demonstrated students' perspectives of their learning from this practicum, which has implications for future practice and further research.© 2011 IADIS.",1
The opinions about the Turkish courses at theb 4th and 5th grades should be given by class teachers or branch teachers,"The basic aim of primary grade mother tongue courses are developing language skills, and enriching the students both emotionally and cognitively by means of showing them the elaborateness and beauty of language. Therefore, the mother tongue instruction at primary grades has great importance. The primary grade mother tongue courses are given by class teachers. As it is the case with other subjects, the field knowledge, occupational qualities, communication skills and language use of a teacher have a direct effect on students' success. In Turkey, physical education, music, visual arts, religion, foreign language, information technology lessons can be given by branch teachers in accordance with the related legislation. This study based on the opinion of teachers and administrators deals with the following question: Should the Turkish courses at 4. and 5. grades be given by class teachers or branch teachers? Fort his purpose we received opinion from 10 academics, 4 developmental psychologists, 12 teachers, 6 primary school inspectors, 5 educational administrators, and 8 primary school students. Data was obtained via oral interview. After analyzing the content of the data, the opinions and suggestions of participants were specified.",0
Effects of cooperating and conflicting prosody in spoken english garden path sentences: ERP evidence for the boundary deletion hypothesis,"In reading, a comma in the wrong place can cause more severe misunderstandings than the lack of a required comma. Here, we used ERPs to demonstrate that a similar effect holds for prosodic boundaries in spoken language. Participants judged the acceptability of temporarily ambiguous English ""garden path"" sentences whose prosodic boundaries were either in line or in conflict with the actual syntactic structure. Sentences with incongruent boundaries were accepted less than those with missing boundaries and elicited a stronger on-line brain response in ERPs (N400/P600 components). Our results support the notion that mentally deleting an overt prosodic boundary is more costly than postulating a new one and extend previous findings, suggesting an immediate role of prosody in sentence comprehension. Importantly, our study also provides new details on the profile and temporal dynamics of the closure positive shift (CPS), an ERP component assumed to reflect prosodic phrasing in speech and music in real time. We show that the CPS is reliably elicited at the onset of prosodic boundaries in English sentences and is preceded by negative components. Its early onset distinguishes the speech CPS in adults both from prosodic ERP correlates in infants and from the ""music CPS"" previously reported for trained musicians. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0
An investigation of early childhood teacher self-efficacy beliefs in the teaching of arts education,"The self-efficacy beliefs teachers hold about their ability to teach subjects shapes their competence in teaching. Teacher self-efficacy is defined as teacher beliefs in their ability to perform a teaching task. If teachers have strong teacher self-efficacy in the teaching of arts education, they are more likely to incorporate arts in the classroom. Alternatively, if teachers have weak teacher self-efficacy in the teaching of arts education they are less likely to include aspects of the arts in their curriculum. Little is known about teacher self-efficacy beliefs towards arts education in early childhood education. Since arts education is an important element in the curriculum of any classroom-including all early childhood classrooms-investigation of the beliefs that shape teacher practice is desirable. In 2010, a survey was distributed using convenience sampling to early childhood teachers throughout Queensland. There were 21 respondents, representing a response rate of 27%. Each completed an adapted version of the Teachers’ Sense of Efficacy Scale for Arts Education. Perceived competence towards each of the five arts strands (dance, drama, media, visual arts and music) were compared to perceived competence in maths and English. The number of hours taught in each of the arts strands was also investigated. Findings suggest all of the respondent early childhood teachers had greater perceived competence for teaching maths and English compared to any of the arts strands. Some early childhood teachers did not engage with some of the arts strands (particularly drama, dance, media) in their daily classrooms. These findings provide glimpses of the current day-to-day running of early childhood classrooms and the role of arts education in the current climate of policy reform and accountability. © 2011, Pennsylvania State University Libraries.

An alternate reality game for language learning: ARGuing for multilingual motivation,"Over the last decade, Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), a form of narrative often involving multiple media and gaming elements to tell a story that might be affected by participants' actions, have been used in the marketing and promotion of a number of entertainment related products such as films, computer games and music. This paper discusses the design, development and evaluation of an ARG aimed at increasing the motivations of secondary school level students across Europe in the learning of modern foreign languages. The ARG was developed and implemented as part of a European Commission Comenius project and involved 6 project partners, 328 secondary school students and 95 language teachers from 17 European countries. The collaborative nature of ARGs provides a potentially useful vehicle for developing collaborative activities within an educational context. This paper describes the educational value of ARGs, in particular the ARG for supporting the teaching of modern European languages and the specific activities that were developed around Web 2.0 and gaming that underpinned the ARG and helped promote cooperation and learning within an educational environment. An evaluation of the ARG was conducted using an experimental design of pre-test → ARG intervention → post-test. 105 students completed the pre-test, 92 students completed the post-test and 45 students completed both the pre-test and post-test questionnaires. In general, student attitudes towards the ARG were very positive with evidence suggesting that the ARG managed to deliver the motivational experience expected by the students. The majority of students who completed the post-test either agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to play the game over a prolonged period of time as part of a foreign language course. In addition, through using the ARG, students believed that they obtained skills relating to cooperation, collaboration and teamwork. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
Singaporean kindergartners' phonological awareness and English writing skills,"This article describes the phonological awareness and English writing skills among a sample of 297 Singaporean kindergarten children, stratified by ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, and Indian), and examines the relationship between oral language and writing skills in this multilingual population. Overall, Singaporean kindergartners, nearly all of whom were bilingual, scored higher on English writing but lower on English oral language skills than U.S. norms. Despite literacy instruction that emphasized whole-word memorization, phonological awareness statistically significantly predicted English writing scores, controlling for English vocabulary, ethnicity, sex, and an interaction between English vocabulary and sex. The current study's findings highlight the possibility of developing high literacy skills among bilingual learners with low oral language skills. In addition, the study demonstrates children's development of phonological awareness in the absence of phonological awareness or phonics instruction and supports the theory that both alphabetic (phonological) processes and logographic (whole-word) processes contribute to successful English literacy achievement. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0
Precursors to natural grammar learning: Preliminary evidence from 4-month-old infants,"When learning a new language, grammar-although difficult-is very important, as grammatical rules determine the relations between the words in a sentence. There is evidence that very young infants can detect rules determining the relation between neighbouring syllables in short syllable sequences. A critical feature of all natural languages, however, is that many grammatical rules concern the dependency relation between non-neighbouring words or elements in a sentence i.e. between an auxiliary and verb inflection as in is singing. Thus, the issue of when and how children begin to recognize such non-adjacent dependencies is fundamental to our understanding of language acquisition. Here, we use brain potential measures to demonstrate that the ability to recognize dependencies between non-adjacent elements in a novel natural language is observable by the age of 4 months. Brain responses indicate that 4-month-old German infants discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical dependencies in auditorily presented Italian sentences after only brief exposure to correct sentences of the same type. As the grammatical dependencies are realized by phonologically distinct syllables the present data most likely reflect phonologically based implicit learning mechanisms which can serve as a precursor to later grammar learning. © 2011 Friederici et al.",0
All in the family: Abdellatif Kechiche's La Graine et le Mulet (The Secret of the Grain),"Abdellatif Kechiche's award-winning 2007 film, La Graine et le Mulet (The Secret of the Grain), included in the Criterion collection three years after its release, attracted over a million spectators by the time it ended its box-office run in France, making it one of the few recent French films to attain both popular and artistic success. Such success is particularly unusual for a director who focuses his attention on Maghrebian immigrants in France. Yet Kechiche's film connects with the realities of contemporary French life in a way that goes beyond the immigrant family in which it finds its center. Kechiche's success is quite obviously due to his particular talents, as both scriptwriter and director, and his skill in bringing together the memories of his childhood with people able to give them life on the screen. In this film Kechiche employs his unique ability to identify and train nonprofessional actors: Habib Boufares, who plays the central character Slimane, was a longtime family friend who had worked with Kechiche's father on construction jobs, like the character he plays. Also without previous training as an actress, Hafsia Herzi plays the role of an adoptive daughter to Slimane, which won her the French César award for Most Promising Actress. Two scenes dominate the film. In the lengthy Sunday dinner scene, the conversation focuses on the familiar French topics of food and love, although the food is Tunisian and the love often unites people of different immigrant backgrounds. And in the film's culminating scene, the young Rym performs a slow and sensual belly dance while Slimane frantically attempts to recover the couscous for his new restaurant's opening banquet. While seen by some critics as orientalist, Rym's dance offers testimony to her love for her adoptive father and her attachment to the traditional music of her ancestral Arabic culture. © 2012 Project MUSE.",0

"Language-universal sensory deficits in developmental dyslexia: English, Spanish, and Chinese","Studies in sensory neuroscience reveal the critical importance of accurate sensory perception for cognitive development. There is considerable debate concerning the possible sensory correlates of phonological processing, the primary cognitive risk factor for developmental dyslexia. Across languages, children with dyslexia have a specific difficulty with the neural representation of the phonological structure of speech. The identification of a robust sensory marker of phonological difficulties would enable early identification of risk for developmental dyslexia and early targeted intervention. Here, we explore whether phonological processing difficulties are associated with difficulties in processing acoustic cues to speech rhythm. Speech rhythm is used across languages by infants to segment the speech stream into words and syllables. Early difficulties in perceiving auditory sensory cues to speech rhythm and prosody could lead developmentally to impairments in phonology. We compared matched samples of children with and without dyslexia, learning three very different spoken and written languages, English, Spanish, and Chinese. The key sensory cue measured was rate of onset of the amplitude envelope (rise time), known to be critical for the rhythmic timing of speech. Despite phonological and orthographic differences, for each language, rise time sensitivity was a significant predictor of phonological awareness, and rise time was the only consistent predictor of reading acquisition. The data support a language-universal theory of the neural basis of developmental dyslexia on the basis of rhythmic perception and syllable segmentation. They also suggest that novel remediation strategies on the basis of rhythm and music may offer benefits for phonological and linguistic development. © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0
Development of science competences as a result of interdisciplinary integration,"Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics from the University of Maribor in Slovenia is carrying out a national project entitled ""Development of science Competences"" Which is financially Supported by Slovenian Ministry of Education and Sport and partly by European Social Fund within the European Union. We are actively involved in the field of chemical education and together with a group of scientists participate in the process of developing new didactic materials, models and strategies for teaching chemistry in Slovenian elementary and secondary schools in order to raise the overall level of scientific literacy. We would like to highlight the importance and the necessity of interdisciplinary integration between natural and social sciences, especially in combining science and English as a foreign language (EFL) instruction. The article presents two different teaching strategies for active learning of specific chemistry topics through reading a passage in a chemistry textbook and listening to a didactic song in English.",0
Rainer Maria Rilke's the book of hours: A new translation with commentary,"Rainer Maria Rilke is arguably the most important modern German-language poet. His 'New Poems, Duino Elegies,' and 'Sonnets to Orpheus' are pillars of 20th-century poetry. Yet his earlier verse is less known. 'The Book of Hours,' written in three bursts between 1899 and 1903, is Rilke's most formative work, covering a crucial period in his rapid ascent from 'fin-de-siècle' epigone to distinctive modern voice. The poems document Rilke's tour of Russia with Lou Andreas-Salomé, his hasty marriage and fathering of a child in Worpswede, and his turn toward the urban modernity of Paris. He assumes the persona of an artist-monk undertaking the Romantics' journey into the self, speaking to God as part transcendent deity, part needy neighbor. The poems can be read simply for their luminous lyricism, captured in Susan Ranson's superb new translation, which reproduces the music of the original German with impressive fluidity. An in-depth introduction explains the context of the work and elucidates its major themes, while the poem-by-poem commentary is helpful to the student and the general reader. A translator's note treating the technical problems of rhythm, meter, and rhyme that the translator of Rilke faces completes the volume. Susan Ranson is the co-translator, with Marielle Sutherland, of 'Rainer Maria Rilke, Selected Poems' (Oxford World's Classics, 2011).

Preface,"THIS VOLUME - first conceived in early April 2005, when the three editors presented papers at the conference held during the 9. Internationale Fasch-Festtage (Ninth International Fasch Festival) in Zerbst/Anhalt, Germany - is the outcome of a round table titled 'Changing Artistic Priorities of German Hofkapellen, 1715-1760', given during the Twelfth Biennial International Conference on Baroque Music in Warsaw (2006). Michael Talbot, chairperson of the session, suggested we publish and enlarge our findings, and in the months that followed the basic structure and contents of the book gradually emerged, as we approached potential authors and received their reactions to the project. John Spitzer and Neal Zaslaw's excellent book on The Birth of the Orchestra (Oxford University Press, 2004) had filled many previous gaps, but we wanted to provide English-speaking readers with a series of detailed case studies of German Hofkapellen based on a close reading of archival sources. The final selection, a mixture of fifteen Protestant and Catholic courts of varying sizes with different artistic priorities, was largely dependent upon the willingness of scholars to share the results of their archival research, and, of course, in the first instance on the existence of relevant primary source material. This book would not have been published without the encouragement and advice of Michael Talbot, together with the support of Peter Holman and Wolfgang Ruf, especially during the planning and preparation stages. We are also grateful for the direct financial assistance received from the Faculty of Music, the University of Melbourne, Luther College, University of Regina, and Jane Hardie, on behalf of the Network for Early European Research, funded by the Australian Research Council. © Contributors 2011.

Religion and Shakespearean tragedy,"‘Religion’ and ‘Shakespearean tragedy’ are a nettlesome pair. Shakespeare’s culture was both in ideology and in daily practices a Christian one, to a degree that can be difficult for us to imagine. Religion provided the languages of state and self, of family and nature, and described the relations between all of these domains. God’s words in scripture told the story of how and why the world came to be and man’s and woman’s role within it, of good and evil, of why things happen and for what reason, of how we matter; it gave an account of human history and an anticipation of its future. Church bells organized the day into parts as the liturgical calendar did a given year. The first book most children learned to read (Shakespeare probably included) was the state-prescribed Primer, which packaged between its covers the ABCs, a Latin grammar, the catechism and a selection of prayers and psalms cued to the official state liturgy as specified in the Book of Common Prayer. In fact, we largely owe our notion of ‘culture’, i.e., a set of communal practices and understandings, to the sixteenth-century English church: the preface to the Book of Common Prayer asserted that ‘where heretofore there hath been great diversity in saying and singing in churches within this realm, some following Salisbury use, some Hereford use, some the use of Bangor, some of York, and some of Lincoln, now from henceforth all the whole realm shall have but one use’. From henceforth (or so the plan went), the entire realm would worship in one tongue, according to one script, at one time and in church. Attendance would be taken. It is not that every aspect of Tudor–Stuart culture was determined by religion, or that English persons in Shakespeare’s day were on balance holier than we. The habit of imagining our ancestors as more credulous than urbane present-day persons is itself a legacy of Protestant Christianity, and rumours of the demise of religion in our post-modern world have been greatly exaggerated. Shakespeare’s England did not resemble modern fundamentalist theocracies. But nor were the soul and other private domains entirely beyond official concern. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",0
Effects of phonological and musical training on the reading readiness of native- and foreign-Spanish-speaking children,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a music training program on children's phonological awareness and naming speed in Spanish. Participants were preschool children whose first language was either Spanish (n = 45) or Tamazight ( n = 52), a Berber dialect spoken in Morocco's Rif area. The two-year pretest/posttest study showed that the children who received phonological training with or without music performed significantly better in a naming speed posttest and a series of phonological processing tasks than those who did not participate in specialized training. The phonological training that included music activities was particularly effective for the development of phonological awareness of ending sounds and naming speed. The benefits of the training on children's phonological awareness and naming speed, two strong predictors of reading acquisition, were significant regardless of the native language of the children. © The Author(s) 2011.",1
"Capturing Indian bodies, hearths, and minds: The gendered politics of rural school reform in Bolivia, 1920s-1940s","For a good while now, feminist scholars have illuminated the complicated gendered processes that accompanied modern state-building and development policies in twentieth-century Latin America. Just as modernizing a European nation's devised social policies to cope with an emerging mass society pressing new political claims and bringing social ills into close proximity of urban educated elites, so too did Latin America's liberal and populist states develop educational, immigration, and eugenic plans to manage their explosive demographic, social, and political problems associated with all the opportunities and ills of modernity. In the era of World War I, government reformers drew from biomedical and social ideas articulated in a transnational professional milieu and adapted them to suit their definition of national need or racial heritage. Latin America's varied postcolonial contexts therefore shaped and mediated the political and social significance, and outcome, of those reform efforts in the interwar era. According to Nancy Stepan, Brazil's reformism proved to be the vanguard of tropical medicine policies and sanitation sciences, whereas Argentina cast its fate with the eugenic process of whitening through aggressive immigration policies and military violence against its interior indian population (1991). The Mexican Revolution, by contrast, made its development policies progressive compared with those of Argentina and Brazil. The revolutionary rupture of its oligarchic liberal state permanently altered the ideological landscape and transformed the national state, making it more beholden to the country's laboring classes and anxious to bring them into the ambit of the populist state. This it largely accomplished through federal agencies of education, agrarian reform, and health under Cárdenas during the 1930s (Stepan 1991; Vaughan 1997). In the Andes, modernizing and reformist elites confronted a more difficult task. On the one hand, they lacked the institutional or ideological resources that neighboring nations enjoyed-Chile's relatively stable political system, Brazil's biomedical establishment, Argentina's immigration option, or Mexico's unifying revolutionary state apparatus-in order to mobilize their own societies for purposes of social control and economic development in an increasingly competitive global economy. On the other, Bolivia's creole reformers (that is, Spanish-speaking Bolivians of European descent who considered themselves to be progressive nationalists) were deeply preoccupied with the ""dead weight"" that their own racially heterogeneous, poor, and illiterate populations had placed on their modernizing and culturally homogenizing projects. As they gazed upon their interior landscapes of mountains, provincial potentates, and indians mired in feudal servitude or else erupting in episodic upheaval, creole elites often turned pessimistic about their nation's racial unfitness or diseased body politic (Arguedas 1909). Anxiety about the future progress of Andean society might then provoke deeper unease about modernity itself. Was Mexico's postrevolutionary paradigm of mestizaje (that is, racial- cultural fusion) to serve as the Andean template of integration, or did race mixture hasten nineteenth-century ""degenerative processes"" of racial and republican decline? How might the Andean nation-state uplift and integrate its indigenous populations while preempting a Mexican-styled social revolution? Might Andean scientists and health workers manage to engineer sanitary cities and healthy bodies, purged of disease, alcoholism, and other vices, without the kind of public health campaigns that Brazil boasted? No less urgent, if attempts to attract white European immigration to the Andes were proving to be a colossal failure, how might public education be made to civilize, moralize, and uplift the Andean nations? These questions vexed and divided creole elites (see de la Cadena 2000). Furthermore, as Nancy Stepan notes, tropes of economic and cultural progress could easily be reversed as ""degeneration [became] the major metaphor of the day, with vice, crime, immigration, women's work, and the urban environment variously blamed as its cause"" (1991:24). At any historical moment or place, social policy making might be motivated by a fragile calculus of optimism and pessimism, hope and fear-and never more so than in the Andes, where weak states and fractured elites competed with each other over regional/racial projects (as in the polarizing Lima/ Cuzco struggle in Peru), or where international conflicts or internal rural uprisings suddenly altered internal political balances (as in Bolivia after the 1899 indigenous uprisings or the Chaco War in the early 1930s). But sooner or later, modernizing states began to expand the notion of ""public interest"" to encompass realms once thought of as ""private."" As the old patriarchal and seigneurial order crumbled, peasants flooded into the cities, and urban laboring groups mounted all sorts of democratizing challenges, Latin America states and social reformers sought new modes of ""population management,"" which could burrow into the intimate interior of the family. Nationalist ideologies quickly fastened on family, as they did on race, to promote cultural reforms designed to reproduce healthy, efficient, patriotic citizen-workers or peasants. Brazil and Mexico offer striking historical examples of strong corporatist states taking aggressive measures to ""rationalize domesticity"" in the service of broader political, economic, and eugenic projects. As Mary Kay Vaughan writes, ""Public appropriation of reproductive activities such as education, hygiene and health care demanded new interactions between households and the public sphere: [and] the appointed household actor was the woman, the mother"" (Vaughan 2000:196). State policies therefore fastened onto gender as both a precept and a tool in their attempts to subordinate popular households to the interests of national development, social order, and patriarchal power (see also Besse 1996; Dore 1997; Dore and Molyneux 2000; Klubock 1998; Mayer 2002; Rosemblatt 2000; Stephenson 1999; Weinstein 1996). There is no doubt that the new gendered policies had tangible, often beneficial, effects. Public health programs of disease control, the introduction of rural schools, and the regulation of work did improve living standards for certain social sectors and did empower women and children in new ways. But feminist scholarship has shown that the states' efforts to rationalize the household and, in Eileen Findlay's words, ""impose decency"" on the gendered body politic were hardly driven by emancipatory aims (Findlay 1999). On the contrary, progressive social reforms hoped to reconfigure gender inequality during Latin America's turbulent passage to industrial capitalism and corporatist state building. This paper explores the Bolivian state's halting efforts to burrow into the intimate spaces of the rural Aymara world in order to remake indians into productive peasants over the course of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Although the Bolivian state was riddled by partisan and ideological conflicts, and singularly impoverished and ineffectual in comparison to Mexico or Brazil, it managed to mount an extraordinary project of rural education, which ultimately came to target el hogar campesino (variously connoting peasant hearth, household, family) as the terminal point of the state's evolving ""cultural revolution"" in the countryside (the term ""cultural revolution,"" although most often associated with Maoist reform is, here, borrowed from Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer's [1985] idea of the slow, contested process by which the modernizing state imposed a normative [hegemonic] order). Rural school reform was aimed at the cultural production of Bolivia's modern campesino class, but it was not simply about ""incorporating indians into the national culture."" It was equally driven by the need to fix racial, class, and gender hierarchies in ways that subordinated the indian peasantry to the state, especially as rural insurgents pounded on the gates of Bolivian cities in the 1930s and 1940s. Paying close attention to shifting social fields, I examine how the changing calculus of elite needs, aspirations, and fears shaped rural school reform, which became a crucial site for rearticulating gender and race categories in the process of educating campesinos. © 2005 The Arizona Board of Regents.

"""Savage dissonance"" gender, voice, and women's radio speech in Argentina, 1930-1945","""History,"" writes communications scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson, ""has many themes. One of them is that women should be quiet. ""1 Across time and cultures, women's voices have been contained, confined, and channeled in ways that parallel other constraints placed on women's bodies. Voice and voice difference have reinforced and naturalized gender roles. Praised for its qualities in soothing crying babies and educating the young, the female voice has been presented as unsuited for public oratory, a terrain typically reserved for men and often directly linked to constructions of masculinity and male citizenship. During the modern era, women have made sustained claims to both citizenship and a presence in the public sphere, a historical theme that has a distinctly sonic dimension. As women began to openly (and vocally) challenge gender roles, their voices became the subject of attack and criticism. Condemned as weak, shrill, and irrational, women's voices were heard as disrupting both the traditional gendered order and the public soundscape, where male voices dominated. During the early twentieth century much of the world experienced important changes in the soundscape. Industrialization, urbanization, and mass communications technology changed the nature of sound, speech, and audience in dramatic ways. As one site of (re)negotiation and contestation of gender in the modern era, radio deserves more attention in studies of gender and feminism than it has heretofore received. In blurring the boundaries of public and private and separating the voice from the seen body, radio is a technology with profound gender implications, one in which we can hear the challenges, reaffirmations, and contradictions of the gendered soundscape in the first half of the twentieth century.2 For many, radio was a new means to make women's voices heard for personal, political, or other ends. Yet while some heard the possibility of greater gender equality, for others a woman's voice on the radio was the sound of all that was negative or threatening about modernity: disorder, immorality, and the breakdown of the traditional family.3 Radio, in other words, has been a contested medium, one whose relationship to the prevailing and dissenting gender cultures was, initially at least, far from assured. Moreover, its emergence coincided chronologically with changes in and challenges to gender relations during the first half of the twentieth century. In her study of women and early German radio, Kate Lacey points out that ""the years following the First World War saw the simultaneous emergence of radio as a public medium and the large-scale emergence of women into the public sphere of politics and production.""4 This chapter seeks to further our understanding of the links between these two historical trajectories by examining the case of Argentina, one of the world's more important early radio markets. Eras of historical transition can generate ""windows"": moments where gender relations become more malleable, often followed by a backlash that asserts, not the status quo ante necessarily, but gendered hierarchies within a new context.5 In such moments one may find women actively seeking to take advantage of propitious conditions, creating and defending new spaces and opportunities. In the early years of radio - the 1920s to the early 1930s, generally - radio's gender character was more fluid than it would be later, offering women and women's voices new spaces and more platforms than were available once the medium was better established.6 Especially during these earlier years, many women fought for a place for themselves and their gender on the airwaves. In 1934 a writer in the popular Argentine magazine Caras y Caretas explained that from radio's inception, there were women who ""understood that radio, in their hands, could be an instrument of incalculable value."" ""In a short time,"" the article continued, ""radio has done more for women's emancipation than all other media combined.""7 But that opening engendered a corresponding backlash that sought - in many cases successfully - to put women's voices back in their place. This did not in any way mean that women's voices disappeared from the radio. Women could sing, they could entertain children, they could perform in radio drama, and they could give domestic advice and sell consumer goods to housewives. But roles like announcing, reporting the news, and speaking authoritatively about public affairs became a more exclusively male domain. There were exceptions to this rule, however, and, as we will see, Argentina offers a rich and unique narrative that underscores the complex interactions among mass media, gender, and political culture during the 1930s and 1940s. For the United States and to a lesser extent western Europe, this process of marginalizing and channeling women's radio voices has been partially documented.8 Less understood is how this pattern played out - or not - in other parts of the world. The history of Latin American radio is just beginning to be told, but little has been written about its gendered aspects and how radio mirrored and in some cases anticipated debates and discourses about women's citizenship and place within the public sphere.9 Stereotypes of ""machismo"" and corresponding images of Latin American women's subordination and silence conceal a far richer and more complex history. As elsewhere, the voices of Latin American women were present from radio's early days, and many sought to use broadcasting as a platform to advance women's citizenship in direct and indirect ways. And as elsewhere, they often faced criticism, ridicule, and attack when those voices rubbed against the grain of prevailing gender norms. Both radio and feminism (broadly conceived) challenged the existing gendered soundscapes. A historical examination of their intersection exposes the points of contact between these two historical trajectories and underscores the sonic dimensions of power and struggles for equality. An empirical focus on women's radio voices in Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s serves to both illustrate these themes and expand our understanding of women's radio history beyond the usual boundaries of western Europe and the United States. Of particular focus here are two important female radio voices that embody the struggles over the contours of both the ""modern woman"" and the gendered soundscape during this era: Silvia Guerrico and Eva Duarte. Their stories also illustrate how, in Argentina, radio's "" professionalization"" and commercialization intersected with a growing authoritarianism, a process that muffled voices like Guerrico's and amplified and elevated that of Eva Duarte to ""a voice of the people"" (even before she married Juan Perón). Taken together, these women's careers suggest new ways to think about sound, gender, and mass communications in a moment when all were in flux and in the process of defining or redefining themselves in the modern era.

The resistant political translations of Monteiro lobato,"In this article I examine the translations and adaptations of José Bento Monteiro Lobato (1882-1948), a prolific writer of fiction, children's books, and treatises, most of which focus on bringing a more forwardlooking mentality to Brazil. As a publisher initially with Monteiro Lobato e Cia. and then with Companhia Editora Nacional, Monteiro Lobato was also a key figure in the development of the Brazilian publishing industry. He was the first publisher in Brazil who attempted to develop a mass market for books and to turn the book industry into a consumer industry. Until Monteiro Lobato most publishing was in the hands of Portuguese or French-owned companies, and the target market was very much that of the Francophile middle-class elite. Monteiro Lobato used his translations, retellings, and writing, as well as his work as a publisher, to advance his po liti cal views and criticisms of the government (1930-45) of the populist dictator of Brazil, Getúlio Vargas (1882-1954), and to shift power structures. Monteiro Lobato's domesticating strategies and his complex manipulation of the place of enunciation in his writing and his translations alike combined with his contemporary colloquial Brazilian Portuguese to create eff ective tools of po liti cal re sis tance. Monteiro Lobato's initial success as a writer was with Urupês (1918), stories about rural life inspired by his experience as a farm own er near São Paulo, which featured Jeca Tatu, an indolent yokel, who for Monteiro Lobato represents rural backwardness and ignorance. This book was followed by his first collection of children's stories, A menina do narizinho arrebitado (The Girl with the Turned-up Nose, 1921), in which he introduced his cast of children and dolls at the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Farm). The success of both books was phenomenal and in many ways started the book industry in Brazil.1 By 1920 more than half of all the literary works published in Brazil were published by Monteiro Lobato e Cia., and in 1941 a quarter of all books published in Brazil were produced by Monteiro Lobato's Companhia Editora Nacional (Koshiyama 1982:133).2 Monteiro Lobato believed that a growing book industry would significantly aid the development of Brazil; he proclaimed, ""Um país se faz com homens e livros"" (A country is made by people and books; qtd. in Koshiyama 1982:99).3 He believed that people act responsibly in virtue of knowing the human experience of other people; such knowledge is found in various forms of communication, especially books, and results in action. Despite his exaltation about books, Monteiro Lobato had a hardheaded attitude toward selling them. He saw books as commercial objects that could be sold just as other goods were, at a variety of sales outlets: ""livro não é género de primeira necessidade ⋯ é sobremesa: tem que ser posto embaixo do nariz do freguês, para provocarlhe a gulodice"" (books are not staples of the diet ⋯ they are desserts: they must be put under the nose of the customer to excite his sweet tooth; qtd. in Koshiyama 1982:72). He managed to increase the points of sale for his works from 40, the total number of bookshops in Brazil when he began publishing, to 1,200, including drugstores and newsstands (Hallewell 1985:245). He was also innovative in terms of the visual pre sen ta tion of books, becoming responsible for more attractive covers than the featureless yellow ones that followed French fashion. Monteiro Lobato stressed the importance that Brazil should give to its own culture, consistently opposing dominant Francophile tendencies that copied the latest Pa ri sian fashions in art, music, and literature. He wanted to open Brazil outward to German, Rus sian, Scandinavian, and Anglo-American literature. Accordingly, he became a prolific translator, adapting such works as Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Robinson Crusoe, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Gulliver's Travels. Monteiro Lobato's Companhia Editora Nacional opened in 1925 aft er the bankruptcy of Monteiro Lobato e Cia., which over-invested in printing presses. This second publishing house issued works by Conan Doyle, Eleanor H. Porter, Ernest Hemingway, H. G. Wells, Herman Melville, Jack London, John Steinbeck, and Rudyard Kipling. Thus Monteiro Lobato helped initiate a movement toward the importation of works written originally in En glish, that continued right up to World War II, when En glish began to oust French as the primary foreign language studied and spoken in Brazil. His companies also published unknown Brazilian authors, thus demo cratizing access to the publishing industry, because being published had previously depended on having either money or influence in high places. At the time Monteiro Lobato was writing, very little had been translated into Brazilian Portuguese. In his 1923 essay ""Traduções"" (""Translations""), he emphasized the spiritual enrichment that translations- and not only translations from French- could provide, and he specifically noted the scarcity of good translations from languages other than French (Monteiro Lobato 1951:125-30). Monteiro Lobato mentioned the lack of translations into Brazilian Portuguese of Homer, Sophocles, Herodotus, Plutarch, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, Molière, Rabelais, and Ibsen. He argued that Brazilian readers needed light and air, new horizons and wideopen windows, to escape their dark prison. Promoting another type of re sis tance to French cultural tastes, Monteiro Lobato believed that Brazil should look to itself: to its interior, to its own folklore, and to its own traditional myths (see Azevedo 1997:63 and passim). But he also believed that rural Brazil needed reawakening. Always the practical man, Monteiro Lobato encouraged vaccination campaigns and improvements in basic sanitary conditions. He thought that the government needed to stimulate investment in the interior, and he criticized the country people themselves for their indolence, typified in his picture of the idle yokel, Jeca Tatu, who contrasts radically with the idealized and romanticized rural figures found in the works of the late nineteenth-century Brazilian novelist José de Alencar, for example. Monteiro Lobato's translation, literary, and publishing activities were thus part of engagement with economic and cultural reforms, and his activist undertakings related to public policy.

Cultural capital and popular culture in year 11 standard english: Fostering student choice and synthesis,"Hip Hop Based Pedagogy is a significant movement in the United States that uses hip hop texts not as 'gimmicks to entice students to be compliant and cooperate' but for their expression of 'enduring and comprehensive themes' (Ladson-Billings, 2009, p. ix). Texts that draw on students' popular cultures can be used in a manner that makes 'explicit connections between students' everyday knowledge and the demands of subject-matter learning' (Lee, Spencer & Harpalani, 2003, p. 7). Texts that draw on students' cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1986) were integrated into a Year 11 Standard English Area of Study in a comprehensive public high school in a low socio-economic area in NSW in an attempt to improve students' skills in independently selecting and analysing texts of their own choosing and in synthesising prescribed and related texts. The strategies used with Eminem's songStan in particular were found to improve students' engagement, independent inquiry and the quality of their written responses.",0
Implementation of multiple intelligences theory in the english language course syllabus at the University of Niš Medical School,"Introduction: Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) is considered an innovation in learning the English language because it helps students develop all eight intelligences that, on the other hand, represent ways people understand the world around them, solve problems and learn. They are: verbal/linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, bodily/kinaesthetic, musical/rhythmic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist. Also, by focusing on the problem-solving activities, teachers, by implementing theory of multiple intelligences, encourage students not only to build their existing language knowledge but also learn new content and skills. Objective: The objective of this study has been to determine the importance of implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Niš Medical School. Methods: Ways in which the theory of multiple intelligences has been implemented in the English language course syllabus particularly in one lecture for junior year students of pharmacy in the University of Niš Medical School. Results: The English language final exam results from February 2009 when compared with the final exam results from June 2007 prior to the implementation of MI theory showed the following: out of 80 junior year students of pharmacy, 40 obtained grade 10 (outstanding), 16 obtained grade 9 (excellent), 11 obtained grade 8 (very good), 4 obtained grade 7 (good) and 9 obtained grade 6 (pass). No student failed. Conclusion: The implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Niš Medical School has had a positive impact on learning the English language and has increased students' interest in language learning. Genarally speaking, this theory offers better understanding of students' intelligence and greater appreciation of their strengths. It provides numerous opportunities for students to use and develop all eight intelligences not just the few they excel in prior to enrolling in a university or college.",0
Landscape and the anti-pastoral critique in Doris Lessing's African stories,"Critics have described Doris Lessing's representation of the African landscape as negative and hostile, especially in The Grass is Singing (1950. London: Michael Joseph), which is seen as an example of the anti-pastoral critique. These views are examined in relation to her African Stories (1992. London: Paladin), which are set in colonial Rhodesia in the 1930s. The article argues that Lessing uses a complex combination of pastoral and antipastoral elements in her stories, as well as the ecocritically-oriented post-pastoral. The construction of landscape in these stories reveals divisions between groups in settler society, such as between adults and children, English and Afrikaans-speaking groups, men and women and black and white. Although anti-pastoral elements such as racism and sexism are evident in the stories, they are counter-balanced by instances where the African landscape supports and provides a space of resistance for marginalized groups. A study of landscape and the pastoral in these stories reveals the complexity of Lessing's vision of the African farm and colonial society. © The English Academy of Southern Africa.",0
Zur rezeption der oratorien haydns in Paris zwischen 1800 und 1850: Institutionelle und ästhetische aspekte,"In German speaking countries Haydn's oratorios, and particularly The Creation , have played an important role in the repertoire of choral societies and music festivals since the 1810s. However, in France, and also in Paris - ""the capital of the 19th century"" -, Haydn's oratorios were performed only on rare occasions, and then they were given mostly in parts. The reasons for these circumstances can be seen in the institutional and esthetical context of the Parisian concert life. With respect to professional concert societies, like the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire , rigid obstacles were on the one hand the enormous financial risk of a complete oratorio performance. On the other hand the established type of concert programmes with its varied mixture of vocal and instrumental pieces functioned as a barrier. Most important was a lack of mixed amateur choral societies, which developed in Paris quite late, primary in the 1840s, and then only little by little. Since oratorio performances lasted to be mostly a private affaire in the first half of the 19th century, it is not surprising, that Haydn's oratorios were studied in aristocratic salons of Princesse de Belgiojoso and Baron Delmar with the intention of both education and entertainment.",0
Haydn's sensibility,"Recent interpretations of both Haydn's personality (as a man) and his musical style (or 'persona') have focused on the two opposed categories earnestness and wit . The present essay adds a third category on both sides of the equation: sensibility (German Empfindsamkeit ), and argues that it is equally important. The various meanings of sensibility are laid out and their applicability to Haydn discussed, including his rich and varied relationships with lovers and intimate friends. The problematics of the possible correlations between an artist's personality and his style are discussed; it is argued that, contrary to recent theories of their separation into different domains, these are in fact closely related. Sensibility was a central aspect of mid- and late 18th-century aesthetics, both in ideas about ideal human behavior, and in prose fiction, opera and drama, etc. - as well as instrumental music (Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach). In Haydn's case, not surprisingly, it has so far been located in genres destined primarily for private use: keyboard music and lieder; this is illustrated by an analysis and interpretation of ""Das Leben ist ein Traum"" (Hob. XXVIa:21; published 1784). In such works we may imagine Haydn as 'speaking to' the dedicatee of the work, as well as the sympathetic listener. However, sensibility is also an important aspect of style in the string quartet and symphony, where it has almost never been considered relevant. Examples are discussed in the slow movements from the quartet op. 76 no. 5 and the symphonies nos. 75, 88, 92, 98, 99, and 102. It is argued that the old notion of 'Classical style' (fortunately now on the decline), with its rigid demarcation of 'high' instrumental genres from both vocal music (Haydn's operas) and earlier instrumental Empfindsamkeit (Emanuel Bach), was the primary reason that scholars and listeners have until now remained unmoved by Haydn's sensibility.",0
"German literature of the nineteenth century, 183-1899","This volume provides an overview of the major movements, genres, and authors of 19th-century German literature in the period from the death of Goethe in 1832 to the publication of Freud's ‘Interpretation of Dreams’ in1899. Although the primary focus is on imaginative literature and its genres, there is also substantial discussion of related topics, including music-drama, philosophy, and the social sciences. Literature is considered in its cultural and socio-political context, and the German literary scene takes its place in a wider European perspective. Following the editors' introduction, essays consider the impact of Romanticism on subsequent literary movements, the effects of major movements and writers of non-German-speaking Europe on the development of German literature, and the impact of politics on the changing cultural scene. The second section presents overviews of the principal movements of the time (Junges Deutschland, Vormärz, Biedermeier, Poetic Realism, Naturalism, Symbolism, and Impressionism), and the third section focuses on the major genres of lyric poetry, prose fiction, drama, and music-drama. The final section provides bibliographical resources in the form of a critical bibliography and a list of primary sources. Contributors to the volume are distinguished scholars of German literature, culture, and history from North America and Europe: Andrew Webber, Lilian Furst,Arne Koch, Robert Holub, Gail Finney, Ernst Grabovszki, Benjamin Bennett, Jeffrey Sammons, Thomas Pfau, Christopher Morris, John Pizer, Thomas Spencer.

The musical world of Strauss's youth,"Born in Munich on June 11, 1864, Richard Strauss entered the world at a crucial time of change for the political and cultural environment in which he would develop as person and musician: three months earlier, Ludwig II had acceded to power over the Kingdom of Bavaria, while almost six weeks earlier, Richard Wagner had first arrived in Munich under the new king's aegis. That these related events did not have an immediate impact on Strauss in his earliest years does not diminish their ultimate real and symbolic significance for his life and career: he emerged as musician within a city where the revolution in music was a matter of public debate, especially to the extent that its progenitor Wagner directly influenced the monarch and indirectly had an impact on affairs of state. Character of the city However, of all German-speaking major cities, Munich may have been the least suited for artistic upheaval, given the nature of its institutions and the character of its citizens. In his study Pleasure Wars, Peter Gay paints a picture of a Munich that was hopelessly polarized, between the cultural offerings sponsored by the ruling Wittelsbachs and the middle class that preferred popular types of entertainment. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",0
Effects of music therapy in the treatment of children with delayed speech development - results of a pilot study.,"Language development is one of the most significant processes of early childhood development. Children with delayed speech development are more at risk of acquiring other cognitive, social-emotional, and school-related problems. Music therapy appears to facilitate speech development in children, even within a short period of time. The aim of this pilot study is to explore the effects of music therapy in children with delayed speech development. A total of 18 children aged 3.5 to 6 years with delayed speech development took part in this observational study in which music therapy and no treatment were compared to demonstrate effectiveness. Individual music therapy was provided on an outpatient basis. An ABAB reversal design with alternations between music therapy and no treatment with an interval of approximately eight weeks between the blocks was chosen. Before and after each study period, a speech development test, a non-verbal intelligence test for children, and music therapy assessment scales were used to evaluate the speech development of the children. Compared to the baseline, we found a positive development in the study group after receiving music therapy. Both phonological capacity and the children's understanding of speech increased under treatment, as well as their cognitive structures, action patterns, and level of intelligence. Throughout the study period, developmental age converged with their biological age. Ratings according to the Nordoff-Robbins scales showed clinically significant changes in the children, namely in the areas of client-therapist relationship and communication. This study suggests that music therapy may have a measurable effect on the speech development of children through the treatment's interactions with fundamental aspects of speech development, including the ability to form and maintain relationships and prosodic abilities. Thus, music therapy may provide a basic and supportive therapy for children with delayed speech development. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the mechanisms of these interactions in greater depth. The trial is registered in the German clinical trials register; Trial-No.: DRKS00000343.",0
Embracing the ether : The use of radio by the latino world war II generation,"During World War II, my father, Ramón Rivas, a young army private, eagerly volunteered for overnight guard duty when he was stationed in Dutch Harbor, in the Aleutian Island chain off the coast of Alaska. It wasn't that he preferred solitude or that he relished the cold and darkness. Rather, it was that now and then, when the AM radio waves bounced just right, he could tune in a radio station, on the Mexican border, that carried the music and the language of his people, fi ve thousand miles away. In 1999 he recalled his desperate homesickness and fear of losing Spanish, the only language spoken by his family and friends in South Texas. Finding the Spanish-language radio stations from Del Rio, Texas, was one of the ploys he used to hold fast to his native language. ""Since I was the only Mexican American in my outfi t,"" he recalled, ""I used to have to practice speaking Spanish. I used to keep myself speaking Spanish so I could speak to people when I came home.""1 Back in Texas, one of his contemporaries, Joe Bernal, grew up listening intently to the diction of the announcers on San Antonio's English-language radio stations. He sought to perfect his adopted language, believing that mastering English was his ticket to a better future. His parents, who spoke only limited English, encouraged their children to learn the language. They told young Bernal: ""We don't want you to be like us, we couldn't get good jobs. So you need to speak English and graduate from high school and get good jobs.""2 But along with English-language radio, Bernal and his family also tuned in to Spanish-language radio to hear the language of their people. Years later, after a long career as a bilingual teacher, school administrator, and then Texas state representative and senator, Bernal said that both English and Spanish were vital to him. English was necessary to communicate with the outside world. ""But the Spanish part, it's something that you grew up with, it's part of you,"" he said. ""It was part of you-you couldn't take it out of you. It was part of you.""3 Bernal and my father were among the Latinos and Latinas of the World War II generation who navigated two cultures and two languages-and who used radio to live within that reality. While it was a common practice for them to seek out Spanish-language broadcasts before, during, and after the war, they similarly appreciated the off erings of mainstream Englishlanguage stations of the day-the music of Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, the Andrews Sisters. In the 1930s and the 1940s, the years in which a new generation of Mexican Americans reached adulthood, radio played a major role in U.S. society: it was the mass medium that could be heard by people in the country as well as in cities; it was accessible to illiterate people or those with limited ability to read; and it was free (except for the price of the receiver).4 Americans gravitated to radio. In 1922 fewer than 1 percent of American households had a radio-but 40 percent of American homes did by 1930. A decade later, a whopping 80 percent of American households owned radios.5 There has been substantial research on radio, which will be discussed later in this chapter, in particular, its early years, its development, how it shaped communications theory, law and policy, how it was the proving ground for broadcast journalism, what it represented to the country. What has received little attention is how World War II-generation Americans used radio and in particular how Latinos/as used radio. This essay explores the importance of radio to Latinos/as of the World War II generation and uses interviews to illustrate how and why they embraced the mass medium of their day. Interviews with and information provided by these individuals reveal that radio was ubiquitous and that the listeners tuned in to Spanish-language radio when it was available. Why did they listen? In general, they have reported that they listened to Spanish-language radio for language maintenance, as was the case for my father, and they tuned in to English-language radio for acculturation purposes, as was the case for Joe Bernal.6 Most often, they listened for the sheer pleasure, and they wanted both English and Spanish. It is perhaps not surprising that they would seek out Spanish-language radio for music, as in the 1940s, Spanish-language radio was 88 percent music.7 Interviews with the men and women of the generation reveal that, like other Americans, they had songs that made them stop everything and listen. For instance, José R. ""Joe"" Jasso, of San Antonio, recalled listening to Spanishlanguage radio from Mexico. His favorite song was ""Ya me voy para la guerra"" (I'm Going to War). ""I knew I would be going off to war,"" Jasso said. ""This song spoke to me."". © 2009 by the University of Texas Press. All rights reserved.",0
Between sedition and seduction: Thinking censorship in South Asia,"Censorship has been getting a lot of publicity in South Asia recently. The mid-1990s alone saw a veritable carnival of controversies over the line between the acceptable and the unacceptable in public culture. By way of example, one might point to the uproar in 1994 over the alleged obscenity of Madhuri Dixit's song-and-dance sequence ""Choli ke peeche kya hai?"" (What lies behind the blouse?) in Subhash Ghai's film Khalnayak (The Villain); to Shekhar Kapur's Bandit Queen (1994), which ran afoul of caste sentiment, the film censor board, and its real-life protagonist, outlaw-turned-parliamentarian Phoolan Devi; to Mani Ratnam's feature Bombay, whose dramatization of the Bombay riots of 1992-93 managed to offend Hindu groups, Muslim groups, and secular intellectuals alike; to the extraordinary intensity of protest (including one self-immolation) and policing that surrounded the Miss World 1996 pageant in Bangalore; to the Bombay ban on Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh (1995), which, in the wake of the national ban on The Satanic Verses (1989), desecrated Indian political idols old and new by featuring a dog named Jawaharlal Nehru and an unflattering, thinly veiled portrait of Maharashtrian strongman Bal Thackeray; to Mira Nair's feature adaptation of the Kamasutra, whose Hindi version was in 1997 subjected to more stringent cuts than its English-language equivalent; to the public burning of a scholarly article, printed by the Illustrated Weekly of India in 1994, that dared to call into question elements of the mythical narratives surrounding both the seventeenth-century Maratha ruler Shivaji and the nineteenth-century proto-nationalist heroine the Rani of Jhansi, and to the cinema smashing, legal challenges, and extra-legal harassment that greeted Deepa Mehta's Fire in 1998, not to mention the direct physical violence that ended the first attempt at filming its successor, Water, in Banaras in 2000, before it had even properly begun.1 And that is just India. In November 2007, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency and suspended the country's 1973 constitution for a third time. Independent news stations were forced off the air, hundreds of protesting journalists and lawyers were arrested, and the Supreme Court was stacked with clients of the regime. But this relatively dramatic move- in some ways reminiscent of the much more extended Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in India in 1975-77-was not Musharraf 's first experiment with censorship. Sporadic official interference with the media, as well as ""disappearances,"" had marked his rule since its beginnings in a ""bloodless"" coup in 1999. As in other parts of the world, the Internet presents wholly new challenges to official regulation in Pakistan. ""Cyber-cops"" working for the Pakistan Internet Exchange assiduously filter pornography, blasphemy, and ""anti-Islamic"" content from online networks. More generally, as Asad Ahmed's contribution to this volume shows, Islamic orthodoxy is regularly asserted in the form of blasphemy accusations. Popular culture is by no means immune: Islamist parties have been involved in incidents such as the 2003 provincial banning of music by the pop band Junoon. And in the wake of the murder of three journalists in October of that year, the press has censored itself more stringently. Bangladesh emerged onto the international map of censorship when Taslima Nasreen's novel Lajja was banned in 1993. Like that of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the banning of Lajja only heightened the adulation with which it was greeted in the ""liberal"" West. Nasreen's more recent books, Ka and Dwikhandita, personal memoirs that identify the author's sexual partners in both Bangladesh and West Bengal, have provoked lawsuits and bans in both crossborder regions. In Nepal, two major incidents since 1990 stand out (prior to that year, under the Panchayat regime, press censorship was strictly enforced). First, there was the deafening silence consequent upon the Narayanhiti massacre of 2001, when the editor in chief, general manager, and publisher of Kantipur were arrested for publishing an editorial by Baburam Bhattarai, the second in command of the Maoists, alleging that the king's brother Gyanendra was implicated in the deaths (see Genevieve Lakier, this volume). Second, there was the more dispersed regime of press censorship imposed along with the state of emergency from November 2001 until August 2002. While not as brutal as other emergencies in the region, it involved comparable restrictions on the press: All pro- Maoist publications were raided and shut down the day before the emergency was declared. As for Sri Lanka, censorship in that country has generally been a function of the ongoing battle between the state and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. While some aspects of President Chandrika Kumaratunga's media censorship have now been revoked, it is still illegal to report on any proposed operations or military activity by the security forces, or on the acquisition of arms, ammunition, or other equipment by the armed forces or the police. The incidents we have listed here are only some of the best known, most publicized controversies of recent years. By no means a comprehensive list, they nevertheless give some indication of the terrain with which we are concerned in this book. Our intention in bringing them together under the rubric ""South Asia"" is to explore the commonalities that result from their shared history of colonial subjugation, to account for their different locations in distinct national polities, and finally to examine the more recent connections and contestations brought about by regional liberalization in the 1990s and beyond. Even though the primary emphasis of this volume is on Indian materials, our underlying ambition is comparative. The very fact that these and other similar controversies were taken up and circulated by the cosmopolitan media establishment in South Asia (and often beyond) is itself an important social fact. Superficially, part of what made them compelling as public dramas was the way that they seemed to stage the contradictions of South Asian public culture in an age of globalization, a period that combined effervescent consumerism with surging religious nationalism. From the mid-1980s, and especially after 1991, the deregulation of consumer goods markets joined hands with an explosion in new commercial media. In the 1980s, India saw the spread of color television (already established in the rest of South Asia) and the coming of video and cable; in the 1990s, South Asians began being influenced by transnational satellite broadcasting and the Internet. In this context, the relationship between the public interest and the interests of publicity inevitably became more complicated. Marketers, politicians, cultural producers, and social movements all sought to establish a presence and a profile, to realize the value-creating possibilities of these new affect-intensive fields of public identification, as well as to proclaim their dangers (Brosius and Butcher 1999; Kaur 2003; Mankekar 1999; Mazzarella 2003; Rajagopal 2001). Structurally, the lure of what one might call ""profitable provocation"" meant that the boundaries of public civility and decorum were constantly being challenged. Key areas included the public representation of sex, the supposed irrationality of religious appeals in an ostensibly secular democracy, and the line between legal and illegal forms of political action-this last paradigmatically represented by the popular rise of hypermasculinized, often violent political organizations like Bombay's Shiv Sena (Eckert 2003; D. Gupta 1982; T. Hansen 2001; Katzenstein 1979). With so much publicity, many of these controversies actually became less rather than more intelligible. The media reportage quickly imposed a kind of discursive hardening, a sort of dramaturgical standardization. It was the prescripted urban drama of cultural globalization, the overdetermined clash between the cosmopolitans and the localists, between modernity and tradition, iconically fungible and ready-made for nightly summary on CNN. At the same time, it would certainly be a mistake to suggest that we might reach the ""truth"" of these events by stripping away the ""distortions"" and ""biases"" imposed upon them by the media. These were struggles that, in a very fundamental way, lived and breathed in the media, found their distinctive forms and their conditions of possibility in the space provided by a particular configuration of media and publics. On the one hand, then, the essays in this book represent a collective attempt to step back from the clamor, the relentless repetition of assertions and counterassertions. On the other hand, we recognize, and indeed theorize, the inseparability of medium and message. In part, this means placing the contemporary moment in historical and regional context. To what extent do the contemporary discourses, practices, and conditions of censorship echo or reconfigure those of the colonial period? The essays by William Mazzarella on the 1920s and Tejaswini Ganti on the 1990s, for instance, suggest striking continuities in the social dynamics of film censorship. Meanwhile, Asad Ahmed describes the present-day adaptation in Pakistan of colonial legal precedents regarding the management of blasphemy. Historical and comparative contextualizations also require us, in turn, to rethink the very category of censorship. To what extent is it an adequate or relevant descriptor for the kinds of public cultural controversies that we invoked above? In what ways might we retheorize censorship to gain a fuller understanding of the cultural politics of publicity in South Asia?. © 2009 by Indiana University Press. All rights reserved.",0
The role of musical aptitude and language skills in preattentive duration processing in school-aged children,"We examined 10-12-year old elementary school children's ability to preattentively process sound durations in music and speech stimuli. In total, 40 children had either advanced foreign language production skills and higher musical aptitude or less advanced results in both musicality and linguistic tests. Event-related potential (ERP) recordings of the mismatch negativity (MMN) show that the duration changes in musical sounds are more prominently and accurately processed than changes in speech sounds. Moreover, children with advanced pronunciation and musicality skills displayed enhanced MMNs to duration changes in both speech and musical sounds. Thus, our study provides further evidence for the claim that musical aptitude and linguistic skills are interconnected and the musical features of the stimuli could have a preponderant role in preattentive duration processing. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Language and student performance in junior secondary science examinations: The case of second language learners in Botswana,"Teaching and testing in science in junior secondary schools in Botswana, takes place in English which is a second language for the majority of Batswana (Citizens of Botswana are called Batswana [sing. Motswana] and the national language is Setswana.) students and a third language for many. The understanding of textual material in science has been shown to be problematic for first language speakers, which means that difficulties in comprehension are likely to be even greater for second language readers. This study set out to test the hypothesis that improving the readability of junior certificate science examination questions would improve student achievement. Results show that changing certain readability factors, such as sentence length, simplified vocabulary and the removal of obscure information, brought about an improvement in achievement. The conclusion considers the implications of the study for the writers of examinations and other texts in science. © 2007 National Science Council, Taiwan.",0
The history and geography of human handedness,"About 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are left handed. Handedness is associated with functional lateralization for cerebral dominance, and may also be associated with various types of psychopathology. Broadly speaking, the vast majority of humans seem to have been right-handed since the emergence of the genus Homo, some three to four million years ago. Likewise, in all societies studied, there is a large excess of right-handers. However, there have been few studies exploring the detailed history and geography of handedness, not least because adequate pre-twentieth-century historical data are difficult to find, and very large sample sizes with consistent measurement methods are required for geographical studies. This chapter overviews the various sets of data that provide insight into handedness’s history and geography. It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so. Detailed data only began to become available for those born in the nineteenth century, and there is growing evidence that the rate of left-handedness fell precipitously during the Victorian period, reaching a nadir of about 3% in about 1895 or so, and then rising quite quickly until an asymptote is reached for those born after about 1945 to 1950, with 11% to 12% of men and 9% to 10% of women typically being left-handed in Western countries. The sex ratio seems to remain constant, not only during historical changes but also with geographical differences, and is presumably the result of a biological rather than a cultural process. Geographical differences in handedness are clearly apparent both between continents (as in Singh & Bryden’s, 1994, comparison of Canada and India) and within continents: rates in Europe seeming to be highest in Britain, Holland, and Belgium, and falling away towards the east and south, and within countries, seen well in Stier’s (1911) study of the German Army, in Leask and Beaton’s (2007) study of the United Kingdom, and between the various states of the USA, in the very large Gilbert and Wysocki (1992) database. Ethnic differences in handedness are related to geographical differences, with left-handedness generally being more common in White, Asian and Hispanic populations-a difference seen both in the UK, and historically in the United States, where the difference between ethnic groups has grown smaller during the twentieth century, but was still present even for those born in the 1970s. Migration studies in the UK show that the lower rate of left-handedness in those from the Indian sub-continent is similar in those born in the UK and those born outside the UK, implying that genes rather than environment are the primary source of the difference. Different rates of left-handedness can reflect either environmental or genetic differences between societies, and rates alone cannot distinguish the two processes. However, a mathematical model shows that effects of different social pressure or gene frequencies can be distinguished if family data on handedness are available. That model suggests not only that geographical differences but also historical differences primarily reflect changes in gene frequency rather than direct social pressure. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",0
Ballet,"During the eighteenth century, a night at the opera almost always included ballet. Such a fundamental fact of life in the eighteenth century is so far removed from our own experience of opera that its reality is easy to overlook, yet it was the case across Europe, even in Italy. Opera audiences anticipated spending part of every evening watching dancers, but depending on where they lived, they had differing expectations as to what they would see and how the dancing fit (or not) into the opera. In France dancing was structured into every act of every opera. In Italy ballets were performed between the acts and only rarely made connection with the plot of the opera. England and the German-speaking areas tended to follow the Italian model, but with local variations. The presence of so much dancing meant that opera houses supported dancers as well as singers. Even today, many European opera houses have a dance troupe, although the functions of ballet and opera have increasingly grown apart. France The French operatic model was created in the late seventeenth century by Jean-Baptiste Lully and his primary librettist, Philippe Quinault, who wrote twelve works together between 1672 and 1686. The conventions they established, including the integration of dance into each opera, prevailed throughout the eighteenth century as well. In Lullian opera the dancers function in essence as part of the chorus, some of whom sing, others of whom dance. Every act includes at least one scene that brings large groups of people on stage, in musically and visually sumptuous scenes that came to be called “divertissements.” © 2009 Cambridge University Press.",0
Promoting positive adaptation during the early childhood years,"Mental health has been proposed as a complete state of being, consisting not just of the absence of distress or disorder but also the presence of positive factors such as happiness, self-esteem, and resilience (Ryff & Singer, 1998; Sigerist, 1941). Th e basic premise of the positive psychology movement is that one should pay more attention to what people do well, rather than concentrate on their fl aws and inadequacies (Linley & Joseph, 2004). Positive psychology assumes that each individual has the capacity to develop skills that can increase life satisfaction, even under adverse life circumstances (Seligman, 2004). As such, the framework of positive psychology is parceled into three pillars: (a) positive subjective experiences, including happiness, pleasure, fulfi llment; (b) positive individual traits, including strengths of character, talents, interests, values; and (c) positive institutions including families, schools, and communities (Peterson, 2006). Positive institutions are thought to facilitate the development of positive traits, which in turn facilitate the development of positive subjective experiences (Park & Peterson, 2003). Although research eff orts over the past 10 years have gathered support for these notions underlying positive psychology, the majority of assessments and interventions aimed at increasing wellness maintain an adult or older child focus (Linley, Joseph, Harrington, & Wood, 2006; Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

Language policies and language education in francophone africa: A critique and a call to action,"The purpose of this chapter is to critically assess language education policies and practices in Francophone Africa, using Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger as case studies. The sociolinguistic character of Francophone Africa has undergone fundamental change since the demise of colonialism. Thus, there is a crucial need to revisit current language policies and pedagogical practices in the so-called “French-speaking” countries and to develop new language education systems and instructional strategies to address the plague of illiteracy and non-education that continues to haunt these nations. The critique presented here calls into question the established philosophical paradigm of “mother tongue” medium of instruction. At the same time, this critique challenges the postcolonial advocacy of “French-only” medium of instruction. Given the diversity of sociocultural, economic, and linguistic conditions throughout Francophone Africa, there is a need to develop forms of education to accommodate this diversity. It is no longer the case (if it ever was) that one size fits all. A serious reevaluation of the status and roles of African languages, and the French language as well, is long overdue. My position is grounded in fifteen years of involvement in international development and in my experience as a firstlanguage speaker of Hausa and Zarma-Songhay, two main languages spoken as national languages in Niger. My work and research in international development involved professional development training for language teachers, extensive observations of primary school classrooms, and policy formulation for governmental institutions and international donors. © 2009 Routledge, Taylor and Francis.",0
Music in the lives of deaf children with cochlear implants,"Present-day cochlear implants provide good temporal cues and coarse spectral cues. In general, these cues are adequate for perceiving speech in quiet backgrounds and for young children's acquisition of spoken language. They are inadequate, however, for conveying the rich pitch-patterning of music. As a result, many adults who become implant users after losing their hearing find music disappointing or unacceptable. By contrast, child implant users who were born deaf or became deaf as infants or toddlers typically find music interesting and enjoyable. They recognize popular songs that they hear regularly when the test materials match critical features of the original versions. For example, they can identify familiar songs from the original recordings with words and from versions that omit the words but preserve all other cues. They also recognize theme songs from their favorite television programs when presented in original or somewhat altered form. The motivation of children with implants for listening to music or melodious speech is evident well before they understand language. Within months after receiving their implant, they prefer singing to silence. They also prefer speech in the maternal style to typical adult speech and the sounds of their native language-to-be to those of a foreign language. An important task of future research is to ascertain the relative contributions of perceptual and motivational factors to the apparent differences between child and adult implant users. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.",0
How literacy emerges from living books in the digital era: New chances for young linguistically disadvantaged children,"Advanced digital storybooks offer, in addition to an oral rendition of text, the possibility of enhancing story content through the use of video. In three experiments, effects of added video with accompanying music and sound on language comprehension and language acquisition were tested in a group of second language learners from low educated families. Three questions were posed. Do video additions positively influence young children's story understanding over and above still images when listening to a storybook? How does video add to language acquisition; through added information or through the appraisal of helpfulness of the added information? Do these extra information sources benefit all young children to the same extent or especially children with insufficient prior knowledge?. © 2009, IGI Global.",0
1994: Movies and partisan politics,"Two political cartoons by Mike Peters help to illustrate the year's zeitgeist: in the first, a man in a voting booth stands poised before a ballot offering a choice between ""Thief,"" ""Liar,"" ""Crook,"" ""Adulterer,"" and ""Psycho,"" and in the second, labeled ""Foreign Gump,"" a Bill Clinton/ Forrest Gump composite sitting on a park bench proclaims to an onlooker, ""My Haiti policy is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"" (""1994 Perspectives,"" 65, 70). Together they articulate something fundamental about the year's mood: hostility toward politicians and politics as usual, and the use of popular movie figures for partisan political purposes. President Bill Clinton began the year with a radio address that spoke to his goals. The passage of legislation to guarantee health insurance for all Americans would be, he said, his number-one priority, but the plan stalled as critics decried administration proposals as ""socialized medicine."" Although another Clinton goal, economic expansion, was achieved according to various measures-the gross domestic product grew modestly, inflation remained relatively low, and the unemployment rate fell-such successes masked other economic realities, such as increased reliance on part-time and temporary workers and a decline in real wages for many Americans (McDermott). In part, contending with two major scandals distracted the Clinton administration from its professed goals. The first became known as the Whitewater affair, which involved a series of financial and real estate deals made by Bill and Hillary Clinton in Arkansas in the 1980s. The second was a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, the first civil suit ever brought against a sitting president. In November, Democrats suffered a crushing defeat in the midterm elections. Riding on voters' concerns over crime, taxes, and a general antiincumbent sentiment, Republicans won control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in forty years. Led by Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich, the GOP promised increases in defense spending, cuts in taxes and welfare benefits, and attacks on affirmative action and public funding of the arts, all enumerated in its preelection ""Contract with America."" Both major parties focused on crime, leading to harsh new legislation passed in August. The issue was legitimated in part through extensive coverage of sensational criminal trials that mobilized fears around gender, sexuality, race, and class. Lorena Bobbitt was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity for cutting off her husband's penis. Lyle and Erik Menendez were accused of killing their parents (this court action first ended in a mistrial). Following a widely televised flight from police, actor and former football star O. J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Susan Smith told the nation her missing children had been kidnapped at gunpoint ""by a black man"" only to confess several days later that she had drowned them herself. Xenophobia was evident in California's passage of Proposition 187, an initiative denying undocumented immigrants most public benefits and ultimately blocked by a federal judge's temporary restraining order. Fears of foreigners were also fueled by the trial and conviction of three Palestinians and one Egyptian national for their roles in the previous year's bombing of the World Trade Center. Outside the United States, civil war and genocide raged in Rwanda, and Russia invaded Chechnya. After a threatened U.S. invasion, President Jean- Bertrand Aristide returned to power in Haiti. There were hopeful signs: South Africa held its first fully multiracial elections, and Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as president. Bosnian Serb forces withdrew heavy weapons from Sarajevo and signed a ""cessation of hostilities"" agreement. British officials and Sinn Fein representatives began formal peace negotiations in December. Although talks on Palestinian self-rule stalled after a Jewish settler shot twenty-nine Muslim worshipers inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs in February, Israel withdrew forces from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho in May, raising hopes for a resolution to this bloody conflict. Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Israel and Jordan formally ended the state of war that had existed between their countries since 1948. The deaths of former president Richard M. Nixon and former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis prompted recollections (and revisions) of their actions and the eras with which they were most closely associated. The Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum's exhibit ""The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II"" and a postage stamp depicting this event with the caption ""Atomic bombs hasten war's end, August 1945"" set off fierce arguments about the reasons and effects of that crucial historical moment.1 Former East German leader Erich Honecker, former Speaker of the House Thomas ""Tip"" O'Neill, former secretary of state Dean Rusk, and activist Jerry Rubin also passed away, as did writer Ralph Ellison, playwright Eugene Ionesco, composer Henry Mancini, band leader Cab Calloway, Nirvana's lead singer Kurt Cobain, and film stars Burt Lancaster, Jessica Tandy, John Candy, and Raul Julia. Independent film lost a major talent with the death of director Marlon Riggs. Among the biggest sports stories of the year was the participation in the Winter Olympics of American figure skater Tonya Harding, despite her involvement in an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan (who also competed and won a silver medal). In baseball, a protracted strike by the player's union led to the unprecedented cancellation of the end of the regular season and, with it, the World Series. ""Friends"" debuted on NBC, and the Independent Film Channel began transmission via satellite and cable. Mergers reached their highest level since the 1980s, among them Viacom's acquisition of Paramount Communications, continuing the ""tight diversification"" and ""synergy"" movements in the entertainment industry of the late 1980s and early 1990s (Schatz 199). The foreign market surpassed the domestic in film rentals for the first time (Balio 60). The majors scored huge hits with big-budget, technically sophisticated summer blockbusters, but there was still room for low-budget, low-tech indies like Go Fish and Clerks with queer or ""slacker"" sensibilities. The biggest film story of the year, however, was the stupendous critical and commercial success of Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and, with the financial clout of Disney-backed Miramax, became the first independent film to earn over $100 million. Debates over the interpretation of U.S. history were prominent this year (Sobchack 3-4), and a rhetorical raiding of the past for purposes of the present was a prominent feature of many of its films as well. Robert Redford's Quiz Show, for example, returned to the scandals of the 1950s to comment on ""a set of issues that continue to bedevil television and American culture: The borders between reality and entertainment, the notion of the airwaves as a public trust, and the lengths to which ordinary Americans will go to gain fame, money"" (Doherty ""Quiz Show""). Tim Burton's Ed Wood went back to the same period for a loving tribute to the low-budget auteur and his ""entourage of weirdos, misfits and dope fiends"" (Klawans, ""Ed Wood"" 434 ). Gillian Armstrong adapted Louisa May Alcott's nineteenthcentury Little Women from the perspective of 1990s feminism, crafting a female-centered version of ""family values"" and validating female authorship and feminine genres in a year when testosterone reigned and even mainstream publications bemoaned the lack of decent roles for women.2 Many of the year's films were linked to partisan politics in even more explicit fashion. Former U.S. drug czar and secretary of education William Bennett conjoined ""the phenomenal increase in social pathologies-crime, broken families and so on"" with ""a culture that's becoming increasingly trashy"" (""Conversation"").

Special collections librarianship,"The last three decades have witnessed considerable changes in the nature of librarianship, and Special Collections librarianship has changed as much, if not more, than other branches of the profession. When I first entered the profession of librarianship in the UK at the University of Durham just over twenty years ago, special collections was regarded as the dry and dusty backwater of a profession that had in other respects had entered the world of information technology with all the zeal of a recent convert. At least this is what the librarians at Durham in departments other than special collections (or Rare Books as it was known there and then) were keen to tellme. The impression they presented was that I was wastingmy time entering a sector of librarianship that had nothing to do with the future, and that was only interested in the past. Part of this feeling was no doubt engendered by the recent move to create a new University Library building on the Stockton Road campus, leaving Special Collections behind in the medieval buildings of Palace Green (where they nestled peacefully with the undergraduate collections of Music and Law, and the librarys store of ""secondary sequence""books).Automation had hit the Durham catalogue in every respect except for special collections. Philip Larkin is known to have regarded the GEACmainframe at Hull as ""the beast in the basement"", but in Durhamit was a machine that would drive librarianship into a modern, professional and ""relevant"" future. I knew instinctively, but did not have the experience at the time to realize empirically, that these well-meaning souls had missed the point. From my stints, both official and voluntary in special collections I gradually became aware that the part of the library with the closest ties to the research community was Special Collections: there were numerous examples.Dr Anthony Ian Doyle had retired as Keeper of Rare Books by the time I arrived as a trainee but was still very much in evidence in the library not least in his capacity as Honorary Reader in Bibliography. Ian Doyle was both research active at a very high-level (his facsimile and introduction to The Vernon Manuscript (Bodleian Library MS Eng.poet.A.1) was published by D. S. Brewer during my time as a trainee), and an amazingly generous teacher, both formally to MA and PhD students doing either English degrees or his own course in Historical Bibliography, or informally to a group of individuals like myself who were involved some way in the world of books, manuscripts and libraries and to whom he was willing to become involved as a beneficent bookman. Ian was happy to involve me in research projects by utilizing the skills I already had and supplementing them with codicological, bibliographical, historical and palaeographical skills I didnt. I was encouraged and financed to set up a dark room in the Library, to take both traditional photographs, and to deliver a programme of beta-radiographs of 15th century English printed books in Durham collections for Lotte Hellingas BMC volume XI (amazingly published during December 2006 at the time this essay was finished). This generosity of spirit provided an amazing opportunity forme to developmy experience and skills in special collections librarianship, but also encouraged me to work harder for the library, because I could see the value of the enterprise in research terms. The other staff in special collections at the time were similarly imbued with this generous spirit.Two individuals in particular played key roles in encouraging an eager young librarian: Beth Rainey (Ian Doyles successor as Keeper of Rare Books) was ever-vigilant to provide interesting opportunities and to introduce me to interesting visiting scholars and librarians. David Pearson, then a project-funded cataloguer of rare books, now Director of Research Library Services at the University of London,became a collaborator in various bibliographical projects, and was equally willing to share his experience and ""take"" on things. Beth as line manager was able to take a rounded view and provide me with a thorough training in both the mundane but essential routine tasks, as well as opportunities to work on exhibitions, special catalogues and publications. Looking back to that time I also perceivedDurhams special collections as making a major contribution to the research culture of the University. Ian Doyles knowledge of the manuscripts, and his expertise as a serious scholar of Middle English brought researchers from across the world to Durham generating what in RAE terms would be called ""evidence of esteem"" and bringing,more particularly, graduate students to the University. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",0
Do You Make These Mistakes in English?: The Story of Sherwin Cody's Famous Language School,"In the early 1900s, the language of America was becoming colloquial English - the language of the businessman, manager, and professional. Since college and high school education were far from universal, many people turned to correspondence education - that era's distance learning - to learn the art of speaking and writing. By the 1920s and 1930s, thousands were ordering Sherwin Cody's 100% Self-correcting Course in the English Language, a patented mail-order course in English that was taken by over 150,000 people. This book tells the story of Sherwin Cody and his famous English course, situating both the man and the course in early 20th century cultural history. The book recounts how Cody became a businessman - a writer, grammatical entrepreneur, and mass-marketer whose ads proclaimed ""Good Money in Good English"" and asked ""Is Good English Worth 25 Cents to You?"" and ""Do You Make These Mistakes in English?"" Sherwin Cody's home-study approach was perhaps the most widely-advertised English education program in history, and it provides a unique window into popular views of language and culture and their connection to ideas of success. Cody's work was also part of a larger shift of attitudes about self-improvement and success. Using Cody's course as a reference point, this book examines the self-improvement ethic reflected in such products as the Harvard Classics, The Book of Etiquette, the Book-of-the-Month Club, the U.S. School of Music, and the Charles Atlas and Dale Carnegie courses to illustrate how culture became popular and how self-reliance evolved into self-improvement. © 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

How to have a HEART in Japanese,"This paper investigates the Japanese cultural model comparable to that associated with ""heart"" in English from a cultural linguistic perspective. Thus, it investigates a range of naturalistic data from phonetic to discourse levels. The Japanese cultural model correlating to that of English HEART has as its conceptual core four aspects of HEART expressed in four terms. These terms are: the physical organ for heart (shinzô); the loanword haato, from English HEART, which is used with increasing frequency along with the symbol the spatial region mune 'chest'; and perhaps most interesting of all, the abstract term kokoro. Following the onomasiological survey of these expressions is a discussion of onomatopoeic gitaigo and sound-symbolic giongo terms associated with the heart, along with the physiological and psychological states they describe. As in English, reference to the heartbeat in Japanese metonymically indexes emotional experience. HEART as kokoro can also exhibit various levels of grammatical agency indicating an imaginal separation from the human body. Next, the paper examines references to the Japanese HEART as ""the seat of the mind"" and its imagined dimensions. Following this is an investigation of how gendered, figurative and poetic HEART expressions are taken up in a genre of popular song dubbed ""the heart of the Japanese"" known as enka. Finally, another look at HEART ideology is provided through the example of a recent children's textbook designed for use in morals classes to foster patriotism in Japanese youth. © 2008 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

Teaching literacy in english language in Singaporean preschools: Exploring teachers' beliefs about what works best,"Singaporean preschool teachers are responsible for preparing their young students for a formal education that is predominantly conducted in English. What these teachers believe about how young children learn English literacy skills is important to study, especially when much of the research is situated in very different contexts. Talking to teachers about their roles is a way of examining interpretations of 'effective' teaching and learning in terms of actual literacy pedagogy. Three broad categories were discernible in this exploratory study of interviews with eight teachers, clustering around their concepts of the child as learner, their construction of themselves as active facilitators of children's learning, and the impact of parental pressures on their decision making.",0
Children living far away: How does one develop positive relationships with children in other cultures?,"In this chapter the relational and cultural aspects of the project 'Polly put the kettle on: English in kindergarten' will be presented. The project was developed and completed in two daycare centres in Lillesand in southern Norway during the period 2002 to 2006 (Maagerø and Simonsen 2006; Elvin et al. 2007). Young children ranging in ages from 3 to 5 years were invited to use English as a foreign language twice a week in order both to learn English and stimulate their overall language skills. Language is, however, developed through culture, and through language culture is realised as well. Every time young children encounter English, they also meet a new culture. Whenever they listen to English books and stories, look at photos from the English-speaking world, sing songs and rhymes, watch films and so on, they are introduced to another way of doing and saying things. In the cultural expressions they meet at daycare centres, children are visible, and the way they play and interact is emphasised. The meeting with English is therefore also a meeting with children living far away. Through the use of cultural expressions in the project, we can observe how the interest in and relationship with children from other cultures grow alongside the increase in their cultural knowledge. We hope that the experience with another culture while very young will make children curious and open in their relationships with others in the future. In our presentation and discussion we will expand on the ideas of 'context of situation' and 'context of culture'. The project 'Polly put the kettle on' has also been part of a larger Comenius Project, in which two daycare centres in Lillesand have cooperated with preschools in Cáceres in Spain, which have also introduced English instruction. Similarly, daycare centres in Belfast, Northern Ireland, have introduced French and Gallic. Through this collaborative effort children have made contact with children in Spain and Northern Ireland through English. This is another dimension of the development of a consciousness of, and knowledge about, children living far away, a factor which will also be briefly mentioned in this chapter.",0
Music and eJay: An opportunity for creative collaborations in the classroom,"This paper draws on results of a research project InterActive Education: Teaching and Learning in the Information Age (see www.interactiveeducation.ac.uk). The overall aim of the project was to examine ways in which new technologies can be used in educational settings to enhance learning. Research was carried out across a range of school subjects: English, history, geography, mathematics, modern foreign languages, music and science. Within this paper we report on the work of two teachers within the same primary school who devised an initiative to support the development of composition skills of children aged 10 and 11, using Dance eJay software. We explore the ways in which collaborations took place between the pupils, arguing that eJay provides a rich mediational tool where creative outcomes are negotiated. We suggest that the computer workstation provides the mediational means by which all pupils - whether or not they possess formal instrumental skills - can be creative, working within a musical style in which they are culturally located. Furthermore, we propose that the teacher is central to the creative-collaborative process and suggest implications for teachers when planning for creative, collaborative work in the classroom using music software such as eJay. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Musical literacies in the English inter-war secondary-school classroom,"This article looks at ways in which the notion of music as a language with a literature operated in English girls' secondary education in the inter-war years. It explores musical literacies and multi-modality in the music curriculum of two inter-war music teachers working in girls' schools: Margaret Donington and Annie Warburton. Both contributed to the professionalisation processes at work within secondary education for girls, within music teaching, and within women's position in musical performance and composition more generally. In tracing meanings of musical literacy and literacy practices around music in the work of the two women, the article looks first at the notion that music was a language in sound with a grammar into which the pupil was to be inducted. Second, it examines the introduction of the pupil to the technical vocabulary of European music through which this sound language was described. Third, it explores aspects that pertained to the ""literature"" of music. The article also traces the interrelation of aural, oral, visual, kinaesthetic and cognitive learning in the development of the ""good ear"", which was used to characterise the musically literate pupil and stood for the competences of the pupil related to what counted as musical literacy. The article looks, too, at ways in which multi-modality in the curriculum was systematically reduced in the development of a more limited mode of highly developed cognitive decoding based on the aural and the visual. It considers how the deployment of literacy practices related to the material history of the music classroom and to underlying aspects of progressive pedagogy with Spencerian roots. The development of musical literacy and literacy practices around music in girls' education is discussed in the context of an increasing stress on the ""aesthetic attitude"" in inter-war England that was seen to relate to a need to re-invigorate national culture and re-order domestic life, which were thought to have been ""unsettled"" as a result of war, and to developing discourses of psychology that pointed to the importance of the ""inner"" self.",0
Formalism,"Film formalism is an unusual kind of formalism, for at least four reasons. The first reason is that, whereas in relation to other art forms - including painting, music, and dance - formalism has been a fairly dominant, mainstream view, in relation to film, formalism is a minority view overshadowed by a strong interpretive tradition. Moreover, it is not a minority view because it has gone largely unnoticed; on the contrary, formalism in its contemporary guise is seen by many film scholars as a threatening force to be vigorously resisted. The second reason film formalism is unusual is that it does not uphold many of the familiar formalist tenets. Most notably, film formalists deny the aesthetic significance of a sharp distinction between form and content, the existence of a distinctly aesthetic response to formal beauty, and the appropriateness of purely “immanent” and ahistorical criticism. The third reason that film formalism is unusual is that it is associated with a constructivist view of meaning, whereas classical formalism, in its commitment to the autonomy of art, would claim that the meaning of a work is determined by its intrinsic formal features. Finally, the fourth reason that film formalism is unusual is that it is derived from literary theory and yet finely attuned to the historical and technical possibilities of the film medium. As we shall see, it is precisely this attunement that explains the unusual features of film formalism. Yet film formalism remains part of a broader formalist tradition insofar as it is, in essence, a program for the structural analysis and appreciation of films as aesthetic objects. The first formalist approach to film emerged in the 1920s, when the medium was still trying to legitimate itself as an art form. This approach was an attempt made by the Russian formalists to extend their literary poetics to cinema. In this attempt, they influenced the Soviet montage filmmakers, particularly Sergei Eisenstein. Both groups shared an interest in language and the technical construction of films. The influence of Russian formalism in the English-speaking world of film theory is comparatively recent, since the first translation of Russian formalist essays did not appear until 1965 (Lemon and Reis). In the mid-to late-1980s, David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, frustrated with the established direction of film study, revived the methodology and key concepts of Russian formalism as part of an updated poetics of film. Thompson refers to this approach as “neoformalism,” but Bordwell, while acknowledging his and Thompson’s shared goals and interests, does not in fact consider himself a neoformalist. Nevertheless, the Russian formalists are arguably the greatest influence on Bordwell’s work, and critics of neoformalism regularly take Bordwell as their primary target. For these reasons, I will treat the work of Bordwell and Thompson as belonging to the same broadly formalist tradition. Neoformalism does not rely on the Russian formalists’ own attempt to apply their ideas about literature to film, because the neoformalists are suspicious of the Russian formalists’ reliance on an analogy between film and poetic language. Based on a much more extensive knowledge of film history and technique, the neoformalists attempt their own application of Russian formalist literary theory to film. In the process, they draw on other literary and film theorists (including Eisenstein, André Bazin, TzvetanTodorov, Gérard Genette, Noël Burch, the 1966-70 Barthes, and contemporary Israeli poeticians like Meir Sternberg) and add some important corollaries, most notably, a constructivist view of meaning. Bordwell and Thompson continue to practice neoformalist (or formalist-influenced) poetics today, as indicated by the most recent edition of Film Art (Bordwell and Thompson 2006), which continues to instruct the student of film, not to “read” the film as a symptomatic text but to analyze it as a complex structure. © 2009 Paisley Livingston and Carl Plantinga for selection and editorial matter; individual contributors for their contributions.",0
Two-fold learning: Learning by developing and learning by playing,"This paper describes the ""Learning by playing"" project, an initiative that involves secondary-school students in the development of didactic software for children of the primary school. This project, started in 2006- 07, is the result of a collaboration between the ""Istituto Tecnico Commerciale Enrico Tosi"" (Italy) and eight primary schools. This work has a two-fold didactic objective. On one hand, it aims to motivate secondary-school students to learn the Visual Basic (VB) programming language through the development of didactic games for children. On the other hand, it aims to encourage and support learning and competence acquisition of primary school learners, through the use of the developed interactive games and activities. Didactic software, produced in various disciplines, including mathematics, history, Italian grammar, science, music, and English, is made freely available via Web. As emerged from a preliminary evaluation, the project was successful in reaching the two initial objectives. From the secondary school students point of view, the initiative increased the interest for the VB programming subject as well as to improve their learning outcomes. The presence of a customer represented a strong stimulus for students who had to develop programs to be used in a real context rather than abstract didactic exercises. Many students were so involved in this activity that they proposed improvements and extensions which were not originally foreseen and required them an extra work. In addition, it is worth noting that some students took the initiative to develop brand new games to propose to the primary school teachers. From the primary school point of view, the computer support and the use of multimedia elements contributed to stimulate children interest and motivation. Children can follow their own learning pace, can repeat an exercise as many times as required, can play and compete with another classmate, with positive results for any child, but specifically for foreign children, in terms of learning outcomes. Most of the results reported above are derived from questionnaires. Additional findings will be collected in the future using other evaluation methods such observation, logging files, task analysis with different samples of users, etc. This would allow a more direct feedback to be obtained for possible improvements. In conclusion, the ""Learning by Playing"" experience has demonstrated to be a profitable case of collaboration across grades and across schools.",0
Can a secretary of state become pregnant ? the influence of the masculine generic on mental representations,"In five studies, we examined the influence of different grammatical forms on mental representations. The instructions given to participants in each of the studies contained either a masculine generic ( e.g. , « les avocats ») or a gender-neutral generic ( e.g. , « les avocats/avocates »). Participants were asked to list the names of individuals who they thought would be good prime ministers (Study 1), identify their heroes in history and at present, as well as their favorite singers and actors (Study 2), or describe the prototypical member of an occupational group (Study 3). Elementary school children were asked to draw a person engaged in the activity associated with a given occupation (Study 4). The participants of a last study were asked to « recall » the proportion of female attendants of a conference two hours after having read a description of the conference that contained no information about the gender composition of the attendants (Study 5). The results of all five studies show that the masculine generic activates fewer female representations than a gender-neutral generic. Therefore, the (French) masculine generic is far from being as neutral as some people claim. These results are discussed with reference to the influence of language on mental representations.",0
Cultural wealth and socially-based inequalities of academic success: The effects of musical practices,"The work proposes to study whether the musical practices of the students and their families can build a fund of cultural knowledge that helps to succeed at school. We focused on what Bourdieu and Passeron had less studied in details: skill development. Based on an empirical survey, this work assesses the effects of several musical practices on the children's acquisitions in music education, as well as the effects of those acquisitions on test results in math and French. The results show that 1) the musical practices studied have a positive effect on knowledge acquisitions in music education; 2) those practices explain the different test results in this discipline linked to social origins; 3) there is a link between the children's musical knowledge acquisitions and their test scores in math and French.",0
Establishing and maintaining sight triangles: Conversations between deaf parents and hearing toddlers in Puerto Rico,"Toddlerese is the special language register that parents use with their children when they are the ages of eighteen-months to three years. If parents are hearing, they use a simplified register, slower speech, a restricted vocabulary, a simple grammar, and repetitious and singsong prosody. Deaf caregivers use a modified sign register, miniature signs, and one-handed signs, all within a restricted sign space. They make signs on the child's body, mold the child's hands to make a sign, or make a sign on the child's toy or book. Parents use visual-tactile readiness strategies such as eye contact, hand waving, and signing in the child's line of vision (Mather 1996,). American Codas develop speech and signed language following the same developmental milestones as bilingual-bicultural children of two spoken languages (Jones 1976,). In Puerto Rico, Deaf parents' Puerto Rican culture, use of PRSL (which is a mixture of Spanish signs and American Sign Language), and use of Spanish influences early conversations with their toddlers (Rodriguez 1993). This study explores communication within two Puerto Rican families as Deaf (or Coda) parents communicate with their hearing toddlers. © by Gallaudet University. All rights reserved.",0
Educational intervention in phonological awareness in preliterate children with Spanish and Tamazight as first language: Comparison of two training programmes,"The effectiveness of two training programmes on phonological awareness related to the child's first language was evaluated. One of the training programmes included musical activities. 97 preschoolers participated in the study, 46.39% children spoke Spanish as their first language, and 53.60% children spoke Tamazight (a Berber dialect that is transmitted orally and is spoken in Morocco's Rif area). A two year pretest-posttest study with three groups was designed (two intervention groups and a control group). Measures were taken both of letter knowledge and phonological awareness, and short term verbal memory and naming speed performance. Overall, the results showed that after the intervention phase the two experimental groups performed better than the control group on all phonological processing and reading measures. Moreover, the intervention combining phonological and music activities was found to improve rhyme awareness. The two training programmes were also found to differentially affect the children as a function of the child's first language. © 2007 by Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.",0
Service on the air,"The different missions of three no-profit radio stations in providing radio broadcasting services in Taiwan are discussed. National Education Radio (NER), established by the Ministry of Education (MoE), is one of the oldest radio stations in Taiwan, and is focused on primary school-level courses such as Mandarin-learning, nativist education, Taiwan's culture and history, and life education. NER's mission-oriented perspective is shared by International Community Radio Taipei (ICRT), focuses on teaching English language by targeting non-English-speaking-audience. ICRT acts as a link between Western and Tiawan's culture, and provides music, entertainment, and news programs.

Link between depression and academic self-esteem in gifted children,"Introduction. Studies of the psychology of gifted children frequently refer to their relatively immature affective development in terms of their intellectual capacities and the relational difficulties they experience with regard to their peers, teachers, close acquaintances and sometimes their parents. From a psychopathological viewpoint, various types of problem have been observed such as depressive symptoms, motor instability coupled with hyperactivity, attentional deficits, impulsivity and a fall in self-esteem. Objective. In this study, we wished to verify the links between self-esteem and psychopathological symptoms in these children. Method. The total population studied consisted of 58 pupils taken from two teaching establishments in Dijon who were subdivided into two groups (gifted children and adolescents versus control children and adolescents). Of these 58 subjects who took part in the tests, 8 were eliminated either due to their results on the «lie» scale of the self-esteem scale (score greater than or equal to 5) or to their age. In effect, a high score on this scale implies that the subjects want to show themselves in a better light than is actually correct. It is then assumed that the subjects had sought the examiner's approval by presenting the best possible image of themselves; 23 gifted children, referred to as GC (10 girls, 13 boys) aged between 9 and 13 years (mean age = 11 years 3 months or 135 months, standard deviation = 14) took part in the study. The selection criteria required the subjects to possess an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) calculated using one of the Weschler tests (WPPSI or WISC III depending on age) greater than or equal to 130 (mean IQ = 145.23, standard deviation = 7.93); 20 were attending private schools and 3 were in the state education system. They were all attending special «GC» classes to which they had been admitted solely on the basis of an IQ test conducted by a psychologist. Their teachers had volunteered to take these classes and had received appropriate training. The pupils had no record of any neurological or physical antecedents, were all French-speaking, were not taking any toxic substances and had never consulted a psychologist or psychiatrist. They were all in advance by one to two years in terms of academic level. They were matched with the control subjects by real age and not mental age and as a function of their parents' socio-economic level. The mean age of this latter group was 11 years, 4 months (standard deviation = 14 months; minimum = 8 years 11 months, maximum = 13 years 1 month) and the group consisted of 14 girls and 9 boys. It was similar to the target group in terms of age, gender, key childhood experiences, divorces, separations and the death or illness of close relations. They had never consulted a child psychologist or been hospitalized for related problems, were not following any psychotherapy, were neither behind nor advanced in terms of academic age and came from normal classes. Their mean Intelligence Quotient (IQ) was 106.04 (standard deviation = 5.39). Children attending special classes (European, Franco-German, music, sport, etc.) were excluded in order to obtain as «standardized» a group as possible. The following tools were used: 1) The Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL), a self-questionnaire developed in 1978 by Achenbach in the USA, which is one of the most frequently used child psychopathology measuring tools both in research and in clinical practice. It is intended to provide a standardized description of emotional and/or behavioral problems as observed by parents in children aged between 4 and 16 years. A French version, «la liste des comportements pour les enfants», has been developed and used for a subsample of the boys aged between 6 and 11 years (Fombonne and Vermeersch, 1997). 2) Carré's «self-esteem inventory» (SEI) was created by Carré (1984) in order to test the level of self-esteem. This tool is designed to measure the subject's evaluation of himself or herself in the social, family, academic and general fields. A «lie» scale makes it possible to reject invalidated tests. 3) The EDICODE is an instrument designed to gather and quantify the speech produced by the subject during a semi-structured interview. It is rated by the interviewer and is therefore dependent on his or her subjective evaluation. It was constructed within a clinical research perspective (Pierrhumbert et al., 1999) and is based on the theory of attachment (Main and Goldwyn, 1985-1994). EDICODE consists of 21 items presented in the form of differential semantic scales. These items are then grouped into 5 factors or scales (containing non-redundant items) that cover the following dimensions: fluidity (associative richness, ease of access to memories, participation in the interview), coherence (the speech is «focused» and structured), appropriateness (appropriate relational distance, confidence in relations, capacity for emotional control), reflection (consideration of one's own mental state and that of others as well as of the influence of such states), authenticity (spontaneous, lively speech). Results. The comparison of 23 gifted children (GC) and 23 controls matched on age, sex and school grade revealed that the scores for academic self-esteem, total self-esteem and lie-scale were significantly lower than those observed in the control group (p < 0.006, p = 0.03, p < 0.0001 respectively) and that the depression scores were significantly higher in the gifted children (p = 0.021). Significant correlations are only observed in the group of gifted children. The correlation analyses reveal that the lower the general self-esteem, academic self-esteem and total self-esteem values had fallen, the higher the depression (r = -0.59, r = -0.67 and r = -0.76 respectively), hyperactivity (r = -0.47, r = -0.82 et r = -0.59) and total psychopathology (r = -0.56, r = -0.67 et r = -0.75) scores were. Similarly, the lower the general and total self-esteem scores, the higher the aggression scores (r = -0.56 and r = -0.68 respectively). Academic self-esteem was the only value to be negatively correlated with communication disorders (r = -0.79) and somatization symptoms (r = -0.49). Finally, social self-esteem, family self-esteem and the lie scale were not correlated with any CBCL variable. The regression analyses indicate that academic self-esteem is the variable that explains the depression scores. Discussion. The gifted children in our study therefore manifested a lack of self-esteem, and in particular a lack of academic self-esteem, coupled with depressive symptoms. For Coopersmith (1984), self-esteem is a function of experienced events in the various sectors in question, while Gibello (1992) sees a link between inhibition or academic disinvestment and everything that may generate anxiety and/or depression in the subject. We can hypothesize that the difficulties experienced by these children derive, at least in part, from their specific characteristics, namely their internal and social dysschynchronism (Terrassier, 1981). Among its other effects, this dyssynchronism leads to a school life that is often difficult or even chaotic, resulting in a general level of self-esteem, and more particularly an academic self-esteem, that is lower than the mean. These considerations might then, in their turn, generate psychopathological symptoms such as depression or hyperactivity (Revol et al., 2002) which have repercussions that affect the effectiveness of the children's school work. This study suggests the need to verify whether similar results are observed in gifted children who do not attend special classes and children who have not yet been identified as gifted. Furthermore, our results indicate that these children are liable to a specific vulnerability in the emotional and behavioral domains that needs to be emphasized. They stress the need for early preventive measures to combat the emotional and behavioral difficulties experienced by gifted children and emphasize the importance of continuing to conduct this type of study in order to explain and specify the origin of these difficulties.",0
"Lifestyle patterns, social networks, and use of formal services in New York: The impact of ethnicity, class, and culture on older people","The foregoing case studies of Jewish, Latino, and black older persons underscore the diversity of the older population of New York City. But equally important, they suggest that ethnicity, class, and culture interact to shape lifestyles and patterns of social care, and that attention to all three is necessary to understand the great variety of older people and how they live in New York and elsewhere. Furthermore, in policy planning and program development for older people, it is essential to recognize this diversity and the vital role played by ethnicity, class, and culture in older people's response to, and their ability to access, health and social services. How best to insure that the great variety of older people from differing economic strata, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and family structures obtain the assistance needed is a major challenge for policy makers and providers in the coming years as the size and heterogeneity of the older population increases. Several themes have emerged from the study of older New Yorkers germane to this challenge. The first pertains to minimizing barriers to service. There is a need for culturally sensitive programming, recognizing the strengths and preferences among various communities of older persons and their families. Furthermore, there is a need to reinforce shared values across generations and communities in our service delivery. Not only ethnicity and culture are involved, but also social class is an important factor. Most importantly, as we saw in the Latino case study, we must insure that there are adequate pathways to basic entitlements. To develop these vital connections, we must address issues of language and crippling bureaucracy. Clearly, language can be a crucial barrier to utilization of services, and programs must be sensitive to and aware of how they get their messages across. Because older Latinos, as well as the elderly of other newly arrived immigrant groups, often have difficulties with the English language, it is essential that there be bilingual staff and that forms and informational material about services and entitlements be translated into several languages, such as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Russian-whatever language is spoken by the targeted population of a program or service. Additionally, any announcements regarding services or benefits should appear in the foreign language press, radio, and television to insure that the targeted groups are reached. Older people of all groups studied talked about the difficulty of dealing with the bureaucracy when attempting to obtain information about eligibility for entitlements or the too often torturous process of securing entitlements. Particularly for low-income, foreign-born, and older persons with minimum education, there may be a need for translators and expediters between the older persons and the services and bureaucracies. While family members, especially children and grandchildren, are an obvious source of such assistance, the increasing dispersion of children and the growing numbers of Latino, black, and white older persons who live alone suggest that many may not have anyone nearby to act as an intermediary in dealing with complex organizations with their myriad rules and regulations. Even for well- educated, English-speaking older persons, dealing with governmental programs such as Medicare and Social Security, as well as hospitals and medical personal, can be daunting and frustrating. Thus, reaching out and simplifying procedures and information is essential if older people are to successfully negotiate the formal service system. In addition, we need to find those key individuals in the community who can serve as pathways to services. Adult children, neighbors, ministers, doctors, and community leaders all need information about services available to the older persons with whom they interact. Fortunately, the Care Givers Initiative under the Older Americans Act has finally recognized the role of caregivers and their needs. This is a wonderful beginning, as community agencies across the countrare reaching out to provide information, social support groups, respite services, and pathways to securing concrete assistance. But the need for more social adult day-care and home-health assistance is vital if the caregiving initiatives are to succeed. A second theme running throughout the three case studies is the importance of family and the relative roles of kin and the formal system in providing social care. First and most important, to provide adequate care for older people, both systems must continue to operate and must be partners in the provision of social care. Neither can do it alone. Families are not abandoning their older members, but pressures on families are growing, particularly in this period of uncertainty and economic downturn. As we move forward in the twenty-first century, the growing number of older persons coupled with increases in the number of working women and changing family structures will require new responses to social care on the part of families and communities. Furthermore, advances in health care have resulted in older persons living longer, with the onset of frailty occurring later in the life span. As a result, serious incapacity has been pushed into the late eighties and nineties, and family caregivers are more frequently in their sixties and seventies, sometimes suffering from illnesses themselves.13 Thus, the role of the formal system as a partner and backup for family care is growing in importance at the very time we are seeing funding cuts at the local, state, and federal levels. The family in its broadest sense will remain important, but it cannot continue to act without more assistance. As we have noted, all three groups of older persons studied indicated a need for more assistance, particularly in home services necessary to maintain independence. What is needed is a clearly articulated partnership between family and community so that together they can meet the needs of future older persons. To insure such a partnership will involve, as we have seen, changes in attitudes about the appropriateness of assistance outside the family system, as well as recognition on the part of professionals of the vital role played by the families in the lives of older persons. Finally, there is the theme of diversity and the recognition of the need for a variety of types of assistance and opportunities to meet the heterogeneity of older persons and their needs. As we welcome the increasing numbers of young older persons as the baby boomers enter the aging cohorts, community-based programs need to be more clearly targeted to the differing age cohorts and the diversity in income and educational levels. For the oldest old, needs for medical care, in-home supportive services, and a variety of living/care arrangements (including assisted living, adult day care, and institutional care) will become even more important in light of the increased age at which frailty is projected to occur. The need for supportive community- based services for such older persons will become an even more serious policy issue, particularly as it is projected that 80 percent of women, the traditional caregivers of older persons, will be employed. Furthermore, in the absence of an adequate long-term care system in the United States, it is important to recognize that many relatively well-off middle-class older persons, white, black, or Latino, may become poor overnight when faced with serious illness, requiring both familial and community assistance to allow them a decent quality of life in old age. For younger older persons of all ethnic, class, and cultural backgrounds, the community will need to consider how to meet their educational and recreational needs and most importantly provide them with productive roles in society, whether through continued employment if desired or opportunities for meaningful volunteerism. Such opportunities are important not only for the well-being of older persons, but also for the good of the broader community. Retired and with time on their hands, they can be a valuable source of volunteer assistance. Further, they often need assistance to connect with the cultural and educational institutions of the community. Senior centers and other community agencies such as naturally occurring retirement communities face the challenge of becoming attuned to the interests of younger older persons-offering creative programming, including computer literacy, hands-on art and music experiences, and forums for political and civic discussions. Even if one suffers from chronic illness, one's mind does not stop, and we are challenged to help older people of all backgrounds age successfully and contribute according to their skills and abilities. Thus, the opportunities for partnership are many. The policy and program challenges of the future require that both the frail and the well elderly have the supports and opportunities necessary for a quality old age, and that we recognize ethnicity, class, and cultural considerations as vital in the structuring and operation of services and role opportunities. By appreciating the importance of these factors, the formal sector will be better prepared to fulfill its role as a partner with families in providing social care to the current and future generations of older persons. © 2006 Vanderbilt University Press.

Academic achievement,"INTRODUCTION Academic achievement broadly refers to the communicative (oral, reading, writing), mathematical, science, social science, and thinking skills and competencies that enable a student to succeed in school and society. Because these forms of achievement are difficult to assess, most researchers have relied on a more narrow definition that is largely limited to outcomes on standardized achievement tests. In this chapter, academic achievement refers to content-area achievement as measured in English mathematics, science, or social studies (e.g., history, geography); it does not cover the content areas of English language arts (addressed in Chapter 4), foreign language or other humanities (music, art, theater), or cognition (except as it specifically relates to science or mathematics problem solving). The topic of reading achievement is included if the outcome measure is a standardized test and the study assesses reading and mathematics achievement of one or more educational programs. While many of the studies included in this chapter assess academic achievement by means of standardized achievement tests, others use general measures of school attainment, such as grade point average (GPA), high school drop-out rates, and attitudes toward school and school-related topics. The academic achievement of ethnic and language minority students has received considerable attention especially as it relates to the underachievement of Hispanics, African Americans, Native Americans, and ELLs. This chapter examines only ELLs and does not consider research on the achievement of Hispanic, Asian-American, or other ethnic minority or immigrant students, except as the samples and results pertain to ELLs. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",0
Introduction: Traveling while black,"In 1849, William Wells Brown set off for a journey to France and England. He was being sent to the Paris peace congress as a member of an American delegation. The thirty-five-year-old Brown was surely a most distinctive delegate. Fifteen years earlier, he had escaped from Missouri slavery, first into Ohio and later into New York. He exemplified what he called ""selfculture,"" 1 having taught himself to read and write extraordinarily well. He had made himself extremely well informed on political matters, an excellent conversationalist, and a stylish man. The year before the peace conference, his slave narrative had been a best-seller in America, and he had achieved first-rank status as a speaker on the American abolitionist circuit. 2 It was inevitable that he would become much sought after in Paris and in England. Once overseas, he stayed in England for five years, partly to avoid being captured and returned to slavery, a prospect he faced if he went back to America. In 1855, Brown recounted his overseas experiences in The American Fugitive in Europe: Sketches of Places and People Abroad. Brown's book is rarely read these days, but it should be, for it is an early record of a free black man participating in a considerable black cultural traffic. In fact, he understood that he was performing as a traveler, his book being ""the first production of a Fugitive Slave as a history of travels"" (iii). Existing at the time was a small, but consequential and growing, movement-a traffic- of black speakers and performers within the northern, free American states and across the Atlantic to Europe. Brown had already represented enslaved blacks and black runaways in America, mostly in New York and New England antislavery gatherings. Now he was stepping onto a larger stage, an international one, in Europe, where he was to become a performer in the fast-growing American-European black cultural traffic of the mid-nineteenth century. His experiences are a good entry point to the theme of this collection of essays. On the title page Brown wished his book to find a place in the future: ""Go, little book, from this my solitude . . . The world will find thee after many days."" It has found that place, in this new effort. By 1850, northern America and parts of Europe had a well-developed black cultural traffic devoted to the eradication of slavery.3 It consisted of a transatlantic lecture circuit, but also more:4 rallies, meetings, marches, speeches, manifestos, newspapers, even songs and memorabilia. It engaged impressive numbers of people, especially women and women's clubs, and by the time of Brown's arrival in Europe, it was rapidly becoming a mass or popular culture arrayed against slavery. In large measure, this culture's authenticity depended on one luminous moment, when former slaves testified about their trauma in slavery, detailed their brave escapes, and in turn excited an optimistic hope for a future world free of slavery. This was, in cultural anthropologist Johannes Fabian's expression, one of the ""moments of freedom"" for former slaves.5 But it was simultaneously highly problematic. Every black person standing before the largely white antislavery audience- often called ""friends of the Negro,"" Brown reported (216)-became a performer who had to negotiate perceptions of slave blackness. Balancing a black presenter's sense of self with an audience's need for a particular black type was tricky. Abolitionist campaigners sometimes desired a plantation vernacular from speakers fully capable of formal English. Still, within this problematic moment, a cultural exchange between blacks and others was going on. This cultural traffic contained many noble political possibilities and many cultural anxieties-what one might call a rich Ellisonian mixture, one that still surrounds contemporary black cultural performance. For his part, Brown rose to the occasion. He performed deftly on the international stage of the 1850s.6 He helped advance the view that blacks had great intellectual capacities. Antislavery gatherings at which he gave speeches-""more than one thousand public meetings"" by his own count (32)-were his primary performance venue. Other stages appeared when he met and was feted by the great, including Victor Hugo, Alexis de Tocqueville, Tennyson, and Harriet Martineau. Other venues of his performances were his visits with farmers, among the working class, and meetings with London's free blacks.7 On these tiny stages, he strove to demonstrate his sincerity as a populist.8 At other times, he showed himself a tireless, high-minded tourist, visiting cathedrals, famous authors' houses, and museums. Brown's reaction to London's famous Crystal Palace exhibit in 1851 revealed what future world his speeches were intended to generate. Its throngs were an ""amalgamation of rank,"" containing ""a goodly sprinkling"" of ""colored men and women-well dressed and moving about with their fairer brethren"" (195-96). Proslavery Americans traveling overseas were one problem for Brown, with their confrontational, sneering remarks. He also faced a possible rivalry, for Frederick Douglass's stentorian magic, spun around England five years before Brown's visit, might have challenged Brown's status as an orator. However, probably the biggest threat to Brown's impeccable stagecraft was the arrival, in 1852, of the sensational Uncle Tom's Cabin, suggesting an image of blacks as dependent, long-suffering, and in need of paternalism.9 It was the fictional Uncle Tom-a character doted on by the English reader-who really threatened to overtake the persona Brown had so painstakingly constructed. No dependent black, Brown took as his core value ""independence of feeling"" (80). A few London newspapers came to his defense against Stowe's treacly book, urging readers to put it down and pay attention to Brown, a ""real fugitive slave"" speaking in his own voice (318). Was Brown conscious of participating in a cultural traffic? Brown wrote, in an understated way, of negotiating the rapids of mid-nineteenthcentury blackness. However, his volume's twenty-eighth chapter, ""Joseph Jenkins: African Genius,"" the only chapter devoted to one person, is very revealing. Here, Brown recounts his encounters with a free black Londoner from the Sudan, a man of ""many characters"" (272), who was as much a trafficker, as skilled in the commerce in blackness and black culture, as Brown was. At a lower level of society, Joseph Jenkins was also moving from stage to stage. Brown encountered him first as a workingclass man handing out handbills. Next, he saw him daily cleaning an intersection. Much later, Brown found Jenkins playing Othello in a small theater ""to deafening approbation"" (270). A year later, he discovered him in a pulpit preaching. When Brown finally spoke with Jenkins, he found out that Jenkins led a musical group, too. It could be argued that Brown wrote so much about Jenkins because he recognized himself in the man-a person moving from one venue to another, each time assuming a slightly different posture. Brown called him ""the greatest genius I had met in Europe"". Copyright © by the University of Michigan 2005.",0
Teaching as a career? Perspectives from undergraduate musicians in England,"Music is compulsory for all English secondary school pupils up until the age of 14. The current shortage of graduates wishing to pursue a career in secondary school music teaching is therefore a matter of serious concern. Taking the concept of ""musical identity"" as a basis, the Teacher Identities in Music Education (TIME) project investigated the attitudes of final-year undergraduate music students towards secondary school teaching as a career. Sixty-six final-year music students at six English colleges and universities completed a specially-designed questionnaire that explored their background, attitudes towards careers in teaching and music, and their views on important skills for musicians and music teachers. Although over half had been involved in teaching instrumental lessons, only 12% said they were considering a career in secondary school class teaching. Frequent reasons cited by participants for this decision were that their hearts were in professional performance, likely pupil disinterest and misbehavior, and that school working conditions were poor. In some cases, participants' own disappointing experiences of school music lessons informed their viewpoint. The results also suggested that the participants felt that schoolteachers' general teaching skills were more important than their subject-specific musical skills.",0
"Style, identity and English language literacy","This paper investigates English language literacy practices among teenagers, focusing initially on three young Singaporean students who are struggling to do well in English. By employing a conceptual framework that builds on a recent treatment of style as identity construction and drawing on interview data that recount the students' practices of English literacy, we show how adolescent literacy seen as style is deeply influenced by, among other factors, the anticipated reactions of peers, and how these practices impact on language education. The latter part of our paper compares the experiences of our three students with those of a fourth, one who is much more confident and comfortable with his level of English language proficiency (adolescents, identity, language education, literacy, style, teenagers). © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"Indication and identification : On the history of bird protection in Germany, 1800-1918","AROUND 1900 a programmatic debate over the general principles of nature conservation reached its climax within German bird protection. Conservationists asked: Why should birds be protected? Why do animals living freely need the preserving care of man? What are the reasons why nature should be protected by culture from culture? One pole of this debate was based on a utilitarian point of view. Hans von Berlepsch (1857-1933), a leader of the bird protection movement, justified his motive for protecting birds with an argument grounded in the ""Practical Enlightenment"" tradition. He considered nature to be a pseudomechanical and, therefore, adjustable system in which birds were beneficial supporters for man's material interests: Bird protection is not only leisure pursuit, a passion arising out of ethical and aesthetic motives-it does not stem, therefore, from admiration for the birds' song or from the endeavor to beautify and enliven nature-but in the first place, bird protection is exclusively an economical question of most eminent significance. Bird protection is a measure for which we humans have material and great pecuniary use. Bird protection wants to protect and breed the birds useful to man on account of their immediate necessity. In Berlepsch's anthropocentric view, birds deserved protection first and foremost because they served the needs of human beings, rather than having intrinsic value of their own. The counterargument in this debate about the aims of bird protection rejected an instrumental valuation of nature. Important protagonists of bird protection such as Ernst Hartert (1859-1933) looked at birds as creatures worthy of protection for aesthetic, emotional, or ethical reasons. Hartert wrote: ""After all, the question why we actually want to provide birds with protection is not as easily settled as it is usually done. . . . We indeed have the courage to say that we want the birds themselves, that we want to protect them for their own sake, that we don't want nature to become one-sided because of our pouches and our 'development.'""2 In Hartert's view, bird protection was an ethical affair; even birds traditionally deemed ""harmful"" to crops and songbirds were vital to the overall balance of nature and therefore deserved protection. From this ethical perspective, birds had an intrinsic value beyond human needs. Although Berlepsch's utilitarian perspective dominated discussions of bird protection during the nineteenth century, Hartert's ethical view was gaining ground in the years around 1900. This ethical standpoint emphasized that not only ""beneficial"" birds were to enjoy human care, but also those formerly classified as ""harmful."" The institutional formation of the bird protection movement integrated these and other reasons for the conservation of nature: utilitarian ones based on theories derived from agriculture and forestry, aesthetic and emotional ones based on a passion for birds, ethical ones adopted from animal protection, and ecological ones borrowed from scientific ornithology. Bird protectionism's ability to embrace these different perspectives enabled the movement to become a popular force for social integration. In this chapter I want to reconstruct the different motivations for bird protection and show how they reflected the different cultural meanings attached to nature around 1900. During the institutionalization of conservation movements in the final third of the nineteenth century, bird protection was among the earliest, best organized, and most popular environmental movements. In the German Empire, a society very concerned about difference and distinction, bird protection brought people together in societies and institutions who otherwise would have had no contact with each other. Nature conservation allowed new social networks to form: animal-loving aristocrats mixed with the sensitive bourgeoisie, the lower middle class, including farmers moved by utilitarian thinking, joined proletarian members of the Friends of Nature (Naturfreunde), anarcho-syndicalist drop-outs of the political Left found common ground with racist spokesmen of the political Right. The reason for the popularity of bird protection and its status as a vanguard environmental movement stemmed from the manifold ways in which birds could be appreciated. Birds fulfilled needs and longings for an (emotional and aesthetic) identification with the natural world, on the one hand, and for (ecological) indication of human impacts on that world, on the other. Birds, in comparison with other animals or plants, enjoyed a special cultural status in the imagination of modern man. As the ornithologist and nature writer Curt Floericke (1869-1934) noted: ""No other class of animals has won man's pleasure and affection to such a high degree as has the class of birds . . . It is the bird's beauty, its grace, its innocence, its admirable flight and, above all, its magnificent song, which captivates us so much. Under these circumstances it was only natural for man to give his support early to the weal and woe of his feathered friends, for him to be struck by the idea of bird protection.""3 Due to their abilities and characteristics, birds were better suited than other animals and plants to serve as cultural symbols and sources of emotional identification. These ""feathered friends"" were a suitable medium for projecting the values and aspirations of the liberal, Protestant bourgeoisie of Central and Northern Europe.4 Through the binoculars of the ornithologist they embodied the very ideal of the bourgeois society: they are clean and spotless, diligent and orderly. Their sexual life is brief and discreet apart from the emotional production of courtship display and song. It is nonetheless exceedingly effective as far as the success of the efforts of reproduction is concerned. The birds' social existence is filled with a harmonious sense of family and self-sacrificing love for children. They are freedom loving yet socially oriented. They are openminded and have proven themselves to be cosmopolitans when migrating to the south for the winter. But their love for their native land appears to be even greater since they regularly return to their traditional breeding grounds come springtime. Birds build their nests even more skillfully than architects build their homes, and they sing more beautifully than opera tenors-and they even don't have to practice. Thus, on the one hand birds are wild and remain alien and strange, but at the same time they are exceedingly suitable for anthropomorphism and for the construction of emotional relations. Birds are, however, also bio-indicators through which complex ecological changes may be observed and documented. Anyone with an interest in birds, whether layman or scientist, learns much about ecological interconnectedness. Through birds, questions about nature-its endangerment and possibilities for its preservation-became an issue for not only elite discussion, but also popular mobilization. Discoveries about birds provided evidence about the state of the natural environment and therefore material for comments about the development of civilization. Since knowledge about birds was knowledge about the state of nature in general, it became easier to criticize social processes and the pace of historical change associated with industrialization. The rapid growth of book titles handling themes of bird protection from the 1860s onward signaled that this issue was no longer reserved for specialists and scientists but was a concern for everyone.5 The question concerning the welfare of the bird kingdom became a question of public welfare and interest. The moving forces in the public discussion on nature were civic organizations, which tried to establish nature protection as the objective of social action against competing-mostly economic-interests. As institutions of social self-organization they articulated their claim to participate in the shaping of social processes. © 2005 by Rutgers, The State University. All rights reserved.",0
Phenomenology of love and psychopathology,"The question posed by this author is how the universal human phenomenon of love is disturbed in the leading psychopathological syndromes. With a view to answering this question, he proceeds first to make a phenomenology of love, for which he will analyze its spatiality and its temporality. The following step will be to show the way that these anthropological dimensions appear deformed both in schizophrenia and in melancholia. Spatiality of human love: In daily life the space of dimensions remains rather hidden, and thus the ""above"" means ""on the roof"" and the ""below"" is understood as ""on the floor"". Every ""where"" is discovered through the relationship with things and is not determined by spatial measurements. The geometrical space, the artistic or the religious, etc. are possible because the human being is already spatial from his/her structure itself as ""being-in-the-world"". Now, the human spatiality has, according to Heidegger, two fundamental characteristics: das Ent-fernen, which could be translated as ""removing"", that is to say, the human being tendency to make disappear the distances, and das Einräumen, which has, in its turn, two meanings: clearing or cleaning, and conceding or giving. The first corresponds to the ""principle of vital space"", origin of aggressiveness and competence, about which K. Jaspers affirms: ""Every position I conquer excludes some other by claiming for me part of the limited available space"". Love represents the extreme case of the second meaning: to concede or to give space. ""Only where you are, a place for me is born"", tells us the poet R. M. Rilke. In love not only there is no displacement of the other, but also there is creation of a new space, ""our"" space, whose most perfect realization is the embracement. It does not enclose the danger of fusion and loss of freedom because, as Rilke goes on to say, ""no one can damage the other by limiting him/her; on the contrary, lovers constantly give each other space, breadth and freedom"". The spatiality of love in schizophrenia and melancholia: The schizophrenic lives in relation to the other with a great fear of closeness. The other is maintained at a distance through delusion, inadequate behaviors, eccentric plans or autism. In loving relationships the closeness of the other becomes unbearable for them and they frequently react in a paranoid way, which is exacerbated by their difficulty to correctly interpret messages from the other. The limitation of the loving capacity resulting from the failure to create the common space, is also revealed to us in typical triggering situations: love declaration, engagement (the Verlobunskatatonie from the classic German authors), homosexual seduction, entry into group organizations, etc., all situations having in common the fact that the other passes the limits they need to impose in order to maintain their fragile structure. Finally, it would be necessary to add that the loss of the ability to meet with the other in love also means that the world goes from being a home, a dwelling place, to an abstract geography, a place threatened by anonymous voices and enemies, where there are no walls keeping out the alien. Here the very basis of interhuman encounter itself-the fact of being unique, free and personal- has been lost. In melancholia space acquires characteristics to a certain extent polarly opposite to schizophrenia. It is warm and ordered; it is a space, where the kept objects retain the past and avoid change. The limits between the proper and the foreign are here very precise, as are too as the ranks governing human relationships. During the depressive phase this space loses color and perspective and, although the boundary between the familiar and the strange does not disappear, the space is reduced, because of a sort of ""inflation"" affecting the body, which begins to invade the patient through anxiety, discouragement and painful sensations. The depressed patient cannot tolerate the distance of the other, so much so that the most frequent triggering situations are constituted by separations and losses. Their exaggerated tendency to organize and to stick to persons and things indicates to us, for its part, the existence of a disturbance of that form of spatiality already mentioned: ""das Einräumen"", that is to say, giving, conceding space to the other. The depressive space is the contrary of that taught to us by Rilke in the ""Requiem for a friend"" (1908) as most properly pertaining to love: ""Since that is guilt, if indeed something can be guilt: not to increase the liberty of the beloved..."". The temporality of human love: With time it occurs as with space; it is only a derivative, an abstraction of the existential time. And thus, the human being is always temporal by virtue of his very structure as being-in-the-world, as expressed by Heidegger. And the reason is that the motor of this structure is the care, cure or concern (die Sorge), where the past, present and future are articulated. In every action we are anticipating and interpreting the future from a determined ""feeling ourselves"" (the past) and we are carrying out the act of encountering ourselves with something or with somebody (in the present). Now, this time is constituted from finiteness, that is to say, from death, and its central feature is the passing. The time of love, by contrast, is the opposite of chronos, of that all-consuming passing time. The English poet Elizabeth Barrett-Browning compares the life that passes and the love that remains (""love that endures, life that disappears""), while Schiller says to his beloved: ""Only thinking that previously we cared less for each other upsets me, because love must see eternity backwards and forwards"". This temporality of duration that we find in human love, and which opposes the temporary nature of life, is also observed in the realm of the religious and it is expressed in a very particular way in the rites. Finally, it would be necessary to add that the poets teach us how love is not only able to access the time of the eternal, but also to vanquish death. And thus Wagner's poetic version of the old legend of Tristram and Isolde sings: ""The old song has repeated it: / to love and to die, / but no, no, it is not so! / To love! To love! / To love even in death / and not to die of love."" The temporality of love in schizophrenia and melancholia: The most characteristic feature of schizophrenic time is a certain degree of ""atemporality"". The past is never really overcome, because they remain in the symbiotic relationship with the mother seen in the first year of a baby's life. Moreover, their delusions persevere both in the content and in the form, which makes them in a certain way immune to the passing of time. As for the future, we observe a lack of purpose and almost an absence of the phenomenon of ""anticipation"", the very ""motor"" of human life. Finally, the schizophrenic patients show great difficulty to carry out (in the present) the tasks corresponding to their intellectual and socio-cultural level; hence, the frequent failures of gifted youth in their studies and of adults in work. The symptom of apathy is merely another form of disturbance of the relationship with the present. This ""atemporality"" has nothing to do with the ""intemporality"" of love. The schizophrenic is outside of time, while lovers have overcome it. The schizophrenic becomes detached from that time that passes, which is what allows action. The lovers, instead, go on acting and creating, but they are indeed able to overcome, through love, the sad and painful nature of time: the fact that so many things that one would like to retain are destroyed and inexorably pass. This eternity of love is what brings the lovers to live often in a state of ecstasy. Nothing of that shows the ""atemporality"" of the schizophrenics, who rather tend to live in a constant disappointment, pursued by a sort of primary anxiety. In depression time passes slower, and in extreme cases such as stupor, stops. The patient has difficulties in thinking, concentrating and making decisions; his/her movements are slow, he/she takes long answering and his/her words are heard without force. Now it is not, obviously, chronological time that stops, but the immanent time associated with life, time as maturation and growing. But as occurred with spatiality, in the previous personality of depressive patients the alteration of temporality is already noticed in that rigid way of carrying out acts, in the constant attempt to plan the future and prevent fate and in the inability to tolerate separations. And thus, the depressed patient cannot, when loving, transcend together with the beloved the space of dimensions and the time of hours. And this explains why each loss pushes him/her deeper into the abyss and that later less important situations can be enough to trigger the depressive process. Compared to the temporality of the depressed patient, the time of love appears to us in all its luminosity: eternity lightning past, present and future, fertility in all that richness that can emerge in the encounter, maturation and personal growth as envisioned by Plato.",0
Voodoo queen: The spirited lives of Marie Laveau,"Biography Voodoo-> Each year, thousands of pilgrims visit the celebrated New Orleans tomb where Marie Laveau is said to lie. They seek her favors or fear her lingering influence. Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau is the first study of the Laveaus, mother and daughter of the same name. Both were legendary leaders of religious and spiritual traditions many still label as evil. The Laveaus were free women of color and prominent French-speaking Catholic Creoles. From the 1820s until the 1880s when one died and the other disappeared, gossip, fear, and fierce affection swirled about them. From the heart of the French Quarter, in dance, drumming, song, and spirit possession, they ruled the imagination of New Orleans. How did the two Maries apply their ""magical"" powers and uncommon business sense to shift the course of love, luck, and the law? The women understood the real crime-they had pitted their spiritual forces against the slave system of the United States. Moses-like, they led their people out of bondage and offered protection and freedom to the community of color, rich white women, enslaved families, and men condemned to hang. The curse of the Laveau family, however, followed them. Both loved men they could never marry. Both faced down the press and police who stalked them. Both countered the relentless gossip of curses, evil spirits, murders, and infant sacrifice with acts of benevolence. The book is also a detective story-who is really buried in the famous tomb in the oldest ""city of the dead"" in New Orleans? What scandals did the Laveau family intend to keep buried there forever? By what sleight of hand did free people of color lose their cultural identity when Americans purchased Louisiana and imposed racial apartheid upon Creole creativity? Voodoo Queen brings the improbable testimonies of saints, spirits, and never-before printed eyewitness accounts of ceremonies and magical crafts together to illuminate the lives of the two Marie Laveaus, leaders of a major, indigenous American religion.

A review of school-based initiatives in media literacy education,"When teachers use videos, films, Web sites, popular music, newspapers, and magazines in the K-12 classroom or when they involve students in creating media productions using video cameras or computers, they may aim to motivate students' interest in the subject, build communication and critical-thinking skills, encourage political activism, or promote personal and social development. This article reviews teachers' motivations for implementing media literacy in K-12 education, focusing on current efforts in elementary education, secondary English language arts, and media production. An overview of statewide media literacy initiatives in Texas, Maryland, and New Mexico is provided, and the author examines some public anxieties concerning the uses of popular media in K-12 classrooms and makes recommendations for future research.",0
"L'usage de la radio dans l'enseignement secondaire à Montréal, 1920–1970","The use of radio for educational purposes in high schools expanded considerably between 1920 and 1970. Education scholars generally qualify radio for schools as a failure. This conclusion is based on the accessibility of radio sets in schools, the interest of teachers in radio for schools, and the budgets allocated for the purchase of radio sets. A wider investigation shows that educational radio resulted from collaboration among school personnel, radio broadcasters and the political authorities. We agree with communication scholars that using a means of communication for educational purposes involves many spheres of society. An examination of the origins, development and decline of radio broadcasting for schools also reveals that this was a technical substitution phenomenon; one means of communication was replaced by another. The use of radio in schools gradually declined, following the introduction of television in schools during the 1960s. Taking all these aspects into account, our study identifies the social mechanisms whereby radio was used for teaching in high schools. This clearly illustrates on a more general level the change in use of audiovisual tools in schools. The Montreal Catholic School Board (CECM) — the largest French-language school board in Canada — is an institution of particular interest for the study of radio broadcasting for schools. Because of it size, the CECM had sufficient resources and personnel to be a pioneer in education. From 1931, CECM personnel went on the air on CKAC radio to popularize instruction in music, literature and language. Members of Montreal's educational community, parents and students alike, and listeners interested in learning, began to view radio as a means of conveying knowledge. In 1936, Société Radio-Canada (SRC), the French-language section of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, appeared on the Quebec radio scene, and educational radio gradually became more clearly defined. The programs that were aired, of which the best known was Radio-Collège, gave the green light to educational radio in francophone Quebec. Before emulating SRC initiatives, the CECM used radio as a tool for social communication. In the early 1950s, the school board used radio mainly as a forum for explaining educational issues to the public; for example, teachers' salary negotiations. From autumn 1950, the CECM School and Family Committee aired a series of ten programs about the role of the school in society. Post-war Montreal society was in a state of flux. Urbanisation and the emergence of mass communication and consumption were transforming the entire social structure. The francophone elite was starting to question traditional values taught by the Church, and religious practice was declining. Reacting to these new realities, the CECM appealed to parents for their help to ensure that together, family and school would succeed in the task of educating children. The board also used CKAC to discuss the shortage of schools. When parents demanded schools for their children, speakers from the School and Family Committee explained how the problem would be solved. As these examples show, Montreal schools initially made use of radio for social communication. Maurice Debesse & Gaston Mialaret, Traité des sciences pédagogiques (Paris, 1969); Jean Vial, Histoire et actualité des méthodes pédagogiques (Paris, 1982); Robert Lefranc, “Les technologies éducatives”, in Robert Lefranc, Louis Legrand, Joseph Majault & Olga Wormser-Migot (Eds), Aperçus sur l'enseignement dans le monde, situations et tendances (Tournai, 1982), pp. 88–117; Geneviève Jacquinot, L'Ecole devant les écrans (Paris, 1985); Larry Cuban, Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology since 1920 (New York/Londres, 1986). In 1954, following the third congress on the French language in Canada (Troisième congrès de la langue française au Canada), the CECM devised a wide-ranging campaign to improve the spoken language of students. This was the beginning of educational radio. With the help of executives at CKAC radio, the board created school broadcasting designed to improve everyday language in students from grades 1 to 12. After the first series of programs proved a success, the board repeated the project the following year, broadcasting twice as many lessons. The glory years of Améliorons notre langue parlée would follow, with the series airing continuously from 1954 to 1963. As a result of this enduring venture, the government extended teaching by radio to other school boards across the province of Quebec. This marked the institutionalization of school radio broadcasting. Transistor radios, the democratisation of high school teaching and active pedagogy were all elements that boosted the use of radio in schools. Radio was now present in every classroom, but television was also being introduced. Radio had earned pride of place but was gradually superseded by television. The range of academic subjects widened, and the numbers of hours set aside for television broadcasting increased. Meanwhile, the use of school radio broadcasts gradually diminished. We therefore attribute the decline in radio broadcasting for schools to the emergence of television for schools, in other words, a phenomenon of technical substitution. Finally, our research shows that the contribution by social agents incidental to schools and the influence of various factors external to schools are of major importance in explaining the mechanisms whereby educational radio became part of school life. It shows that radio changed in status from a public communication tool in the 1930s, to a pedagogic tool supporting the teaching of French twenty years later. Our study also shows that radio for schools was created not only by school-related actors and institutions but also by the mass media and government. Far from being a failure, as education scholars maintain, educational radio was a success, but was replaced by television in the late 1960s. © Stichting Paedagogica Historica.",0
Dependency,"Systems of domination are often transmitted and replicated in the most innocent forms: through mass media, for example, by way of film and television, sometimes through musical idioms, occasionally by way of fashion and style, through consumption habits and the iconography of popular culture – in sum, within normative systems embedded in notions of progress and modernity and subsequently insinuate themselves in the vernacular forms by which people transact daily life. More than twenty-five years ago, Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelhart chronicled the presence of Donald Duck in Latin America. Donald Duck was identified speaking Spanish and Portuguese, and appeared serialized in the comic strips of scores of newspapers and magazines. The Disney comic book appeared in at least four different Spanish-language editions. In thousands of movie houses and on hundreds of thousands of television screens across the Hemisphere, the accumulated inventory of decades of Disney animated films has played and replayed to the squealing delight of successive generations of unsuspecting Latin American children. Who was this Latin American incarnation of Donald Duck (“el Pato Donald”)? He was North American, and he embodied North American cultural norms and articulated North American ideological imperatives. In dialogue with his nephews, he talked politics; in conversation with his uncle, he discussed economics. The moral was not obvious, but it was never disguised: the virtues of capitalism, the vices of communism. Donald Duck was an agent of imperialism. © Michael J. Hogan and Thomas G. Paterson 2004.",0
Introduction: Rossini’s operatic operas,"‘Since the death of Napoleon, another man has appeared who is talked about every day in Moscow as in Naples, in London as in Vienna, in Paris as in Calcutta. The fame of this man knows no bounds save those of civilisation itself; and he is not yet thirty-two!’ The opening words of Rossini's first biography – by none other than Stendhal, and published in Paris in 1824 – help introduce what at first might seem an extravagant claim: Rossini was Europe's most famous composer in the first half of the nineteenth century; his music reached the largest number of listeners, whether in opera houses, or concert halls, or played in countless arrangements printed for all sorts of performing forces, or simply whistled in the streets. In other words, nineteenth-century musical culture cannot be understood without taking Rossini into prominent account; any history that relegates Rossini to a secondary rôle must to some extent ignore the tastes of those who inhabited the period. And yet such histories have been the norm rather than the exception in the past century, especially in the English-speaking world. The reasons behind this historiographical neglect are numerous and diverse, but chief among them is probably the progressive disappearance of Rossini's works from the repertory of opera houses during the second half of the nineteenth century, a trend not reversed until the later decades of the twentieth. Only a handful of his comic operas were performed, especially Il barbiere di Siviglia, which remains the most popular and frequently revived. © Cambridge University Press 2004 and 2011.",0
Verdi’s life: A thematic biography,"Giuseppe Verdi, born in a country village in the Po Valley in 1813, rose to become the most popular opera composer of his century. Across a career that spanned more than sixty years he won international fame, becoming the venerated and often decorated grand old man of Italy, “il gran vegliardo.” Setting his stamp on two generations of performers, he transformed a showcase for prime donne and celebrated tenors into a serious theatre for singing actors. A patriot, Verdi was twice elected to political office and was honored as Senator for Life. He was also a farmer and philanthropist. At his death in 1901, he left behind a legacy of landmark works. Verdi's art has remained as accessible and popular as it was during his lifetime, his major operas constituting the backbone of today's standard repertory. Three of his homes and the home of Antonio Barezzi, his patron and father-in-law, are open to the public as museums. Now, as before, Verdi speaks to us all, even as he remains a beloved symbol of Italy and its culture, a man for his time and ours. The child, the village, and the land Verdi was born on October 10, 1813, in Roncole, a hamlet standing in open land about sixty-five miles southeast of Milan with the Apennines looming on the south and west and the River Po flowing to the north, where most income came from wheat, corn, and hogs. In this world of flat fields edged by rows of Lombardy poplars and irrigation canals, the only large buildings were the parish churches, among them Verdi's San Michele Arcangelo in Roncole. The people there spoke a sweet, liquid dialect that was heavily influenced by French and was the only spoken language of Verdi’s early years. Peaceful today but chaotic during Verdi’s infancy, the area was overrun with troops fighting the NapoleonicWars. © Cambridge University Press 2004.",0
Cognitive function evaluation in school-age children from economically impoverished community: Results of enriched education program,"Sixty-three school-age children of low socioeconomic status and exposed to adverse environmental factors (malnutrition, familiar distress and low familiar incomes) were submitted to neuropsychological tests to investigate possible cognitive impairments. Classical neuropsychological test battery was employed (Raven test, Bender Gestalt copy of complex figures, draw-a-man Goodenough test). Low intellectual level was found on 30% and 74% showed higher cognitive disorders (visuoperceptual skills and/or perseverations and/or global shapes perception and/or draw-a-man disturbances). These children attended to a school with semi-boarding regimen which receives children under personnel and social adverse factors. School program was enriched with learning activity program based on Piaget and psychomotor exercises based on Lambert for at least one year. They also had some other activities, as painting, singing, computer training, English and Spanish classes. Twenty children were newly accepted and 43 attended at school for one, two or three years. We found significant correlations (p≤0.05) between superior intellectual performances, bigger periods of attendance at school and methods for cognitive development. There was no association between other brain cognitive functions examined, the attendance to the teaching programs and the years of permanence at school.",0
Jesting with edge tools: The dynamics of a fragmentary ballad tradition,"Carpenters and Joiners are not hard to find in English traditional song. James Madison Carpenter is beginning to be recognized as one of the most significant collectors of English, as well as Scottish, song, while one of the best traditional singers at the beginning of this century was Mrs. Joiner of Chiswell Green in Hertfordshire (we do not know her first name) (Bishop 1998). Lucy Broadwood visited her on several occasions, and she sang a fine ""Poacher's Song."" This essay, though, is a search for the other carpenters and joiners, members of the occupations represented by those names. Although they were in other respects a militant and articulate group with a known singing tradition, there is no evidence that the songs they sang ever dealt with their work, and there are no songs with enough circumstantial occupational detail to suggest that it had a significant role. This contrasts, for example, with Germany, where collections of carpenters' songs were edited by firms that sold the special outfits that they wore.1 There are only two examples of songs featuring carpenters in the oral tradition, ""The House Carpenter"" and ""The Cruel Ship's Carpenter,"" and in both the occupation is purely incidental (Porter 1992: 13). By the nineteenth century, the carpenters and joiners were one of the best organized and disciplined of all occupation groups. In the country they owned their own tools and were found in every village. In the towns they combined until 1850 with the millwrights (later the basis of the engineering industry) in a union that included cabinet-makers, pattern makers, and joiners. By 1812 the illegal carpenters' union in London had ten thousand pounds in the kitty. In 1825 they led a strike in the Potteries, the manufacturing district in the English Midlands. As a result, their pay rose by 1832 to nearly as much as an engineer's and three times that of a weaver. In the 1840s, as with the shoemakers, a distinction emerged between the ""honorable"" and "" dishonorable"" parts of the trade, much like the one between ""first fixers,"" ""second fixers,"" and ""shop fitters"" today.2 In 1860, in response to the need for a more-powerful organization after losing a strike the previous year, the General Union of Carpenters was ""battered into insignificance,"" and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners was formed (Cole and Postgate 1981: 406). It was one of the so-called Junta of unions, second only to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (Morton 1974: 443). The iconography of the union's membership certificate indicates its elite status: The design plays down the physical and dynamic presence of its members. They stand to the side, very much at ease with plane and saw resting on the ground, which is strewn with other tools. Only the carpenter on the left strikes a semiheroic pose. However, the workers' stature is achieved metonymically, by associating them with heroic signifiers drawn partly from the dominant discourse, partly from the neoclassical icons of the French and American Revolutions. These include plinths, columns, emblems of health and peace, and symbolic figures like Truth and Justice. However, they do not share the Romantic rhetoric of individualism espoused by those revolutions. Instead, the texts that are visible everywhere emphasize the power that comes from uniting and the humanity of collective action: The text on the architrave reads, ""UNITED TO PROTECT NOT COMBINED TO INJURE,"" and the one beneath the columns says, ""INDUSTRY AND BENEVOLENCE UNITE US IN FRIENDSHIP."" The central panel is devoted to the key cooperative task of centering a bridge, one where many occupations are involved (see, for example, Michael Ondaatje's novel In the Skin of a Lion). The foregrounding of a structure in this way is very common. From the early years of the century, ""the various building trades offered the major outlet for skilled men"" (Burnett 1974: 256), and the members identified increasingly with construction workers as a whole: The text beneath the seated figure at the top reads, ""UNITED WE STAND."" The results were not long in coming. In the next London strike, in 1872, they were supported by other construction workers and won. As late as 1875, their union was still larger than that of the miners and the textile workers (Applebaum 1992: 416). In this company, the silence of the carpenters seems unaccountable. Perhaps the rarity of their songs is explained by a proverb that was common in the seventeenth century: ""The best carpenter makes the fewest chips"" (Wilson 1992: 47).3 However, in the song record, it is precisely the chips that we must deal with: stray references, parodies, sexual metaphors that seem to stand apart from those who were following an occupation that, as part of the huge construction industry, still exists in virtually every street and village in the land. © 2003 by The Utah State University Press.

"""There's a dance every weekend"": Powwow culture in Southeast North Carolina","On a June afternoon last year, Derek Lowry and I visited with members of the Ray Littleturtle family in their Pembroke, North Carolina, home to talk about powwow culture in North Carolina's Indian communities. Derek, a Tuscarora in his mid-forties, and Ray, a Lumbee in his mid-sixties, are longtime powwowers and mainstays in the East Coast powwow world as dancers, emcees, contest judges, and dance organizers. We were joined from time to time by Ray's wife, Kat, who is a well-known Cherokee artisan and storyteller, and by Ray's oldest son, Cochise, who is a lifelong powwower in his thirties. As we waited for Ray to return from an errand, his young grandson Kayla wandered into the room and said to no one in particular that he'd like to sing a powwow song for us from the Northern Plains called a Crow Hop. Picking up a drum stick, he sat by a large powwow drum in the living room and confidently sang with skill and precision. Beaming - and happy to oblige his appreciative audience - Kayla concluded his impromptu performance with an energetic dance demonstration before heading off for another round of hide-and-seek with his cousins. Kat nodded approvingly and said that because of powwows, Kayla and his siblings were growing up with traditions and beliefs that nourished their souls as Indian people, something that had not been easy for her generation to do. Equally important, she added, was the fact that powwows also sent a c lear message to non-natives about Indian values and identity. ""There's a power in that arena that you don't get in other places,"" Kat said. ""These kids feel it. And so do the non-Indians who watch. That's important"" (K. Littleturtle 2001). When Ray rejoined us, our conversations echoed what others had previously told me about powwow culture and identity among southeast North Carolina's Indian people. Ray said that when he was a young man, being Indian had little meaning beyond the largely negative stereotypes that came with being a person of color in Robeson County. ""We had no r eal cultural i dentity. W hat we h ad w as racial identity,"" he said. Moreover, because of the region's deeply ingrained Indian-Jim Crow system, ""Racial identity didn't help us very much in the 1960s in the South."" What Indians lacked, he said, were cultural institutions that could be safely and advantageously displayed in public. There were Indian churches and schools across the region, but although these were important sources of community pride and cohesiveness, Littleturtle was of the opinion that they tended to emphasize values that were not noticeably different from white, mainstream society (R. Littleturtle 2001). When powwow culture gained a foothold in North Carolina in the 1960s, it addressed that identity crisis in several ways. First, it facilitated what Ray described as ""internal reidentification."" ""We had heard grandpa talk about 'Indian ways,' but what did that mean? For my generation, being Indian wasn't something that you showed. You couldn't. And if you tried, you paid hell for it."" But powwow culture gave Indian people an opportunity to publicly negotiate and express their ethnic rather than racial identity in ways that they and non-natives alike recognized and respected according to forums completely controlled by Indian people. ""There was an elevation of pride in a visible sense,"" Ray said. ""We wore that pride, and we invited others in. And we showed non-natives what our culture was all about."" Ray hastened to add that ""these days, children like my grandson have no problem knowing who they are,"" Ray said. ""And it all came from the powwow. Prior to that, you have to understand that it was all underground, and even then no one really had much to go on except for the old people, and they didn't tell us much"" (R. Littleturtle 2001). As Ray, Kat, Derek, Cochise, and I talked, it became clear that powwows in southeast North Carolina are important for a number of different reasons. On the one hand, they express a shared sense of Indian identity and heritage. By drawing together communities, celebrating annual holidays and rituals, and filling voids in the social fabric of people who have often been politically and economically marginalized, powwows in southeast North Carolina allow Indians to safely express their culture in a public arena. On the other hand, powwows also deliberately reinforce public perceptions long associated with Indianness including an emphasis on a relationship with nature that borders on the paranormal, a recognition of the powwow circle's sacral power, and a deeply felt sense of community bonds and relationships. Those perceptions and images have become a c ritical part of the region's powwow lore for partic ipants and observers alike. © 2003 by University of Alabama Press. All rights reserved.",0
Religious healing in southern Appalachian communities,"Mary was canning pickles as I stepped through the kitchen doorway on an August afternoon. Mary, a seventy-six-year-old widow, was the one to first introduce me to the Missionary Baptist church I attended over several years in Bradford County, North Carolina. The mother-in-law of the preacher who founded the church, Mary and her family, including her four granddaughters, are pillars of the church. I enjoyed stopping by frequently to visit with Mary. She was always busy doing something interesting and I learned much about mountain family life in her kitchen. When I pulled into the driveway of Mary's one-story brick house on this particular August afternoon I had been listening to a pop radio station playing Pearl Jam's remake of a song I remembered from my Californian youth - ""Last Kiss."" As I picked up a glass jar to help Mary with her canning, I started singing the song's chorus: Where oh where can my baby be? The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to Heaven so I got to be good, So I can see my baby when I leave this world. ""You can't get to Heaven by being good,"" said Mary, challenging the song's vague version of the Protestant ethic. ""The only way you get to Heaven is by being saved."" I was immediately reminded of the specific emphasis on faith and grace rather than ""works"" in mountain churches. While this emphasis is shared by evangelical traditions of the South generally, religious experience in southern Appalachia lends itself to regional or subregional interpretations. The issue of the uniqueness of Appalachian culture c uniqueness and those who do not (see, for example, Jones 1994; Williams 1961 versus Billings 1974; Fisher 1991). Both factions take umbrage at the stereotypes that continue to reinforce the idea of mountain people being lesser and Other (see Billings, Norman, and Ledford 1999). To be sure, southern mountain people share much in general with southerners and with other Americans. Yet, as I have pointed out elsewhere, Appalachian people continue to be set apart, both by themselves and in the minds of others. Those cultural differences that exist between Appalachians and non-Appalachian Anglo-Americans are most often differences in strength of presence of a trait, rather than differences in kinds of traits. These differences tend to take on significance due to the perceptions of the observer and the observed, rather than any inherent qualities of the traits. Moreover, while an identity as ""Appalachian,"" or more pejoratively ""hillbilly"" or ""redneck,"" may have been largely forced by outsiders in the past, it is becoming an identity of choice among many Appalachian natives for cultural and political reasons. (Keefe 1998, 129) Language and religion shape perhaps the most distinctive aspects of Appalachian culture. Social linguists observe that dialect is a primary means by which boundaries of social groups are marked, especially among people otherwise culturally similar. The Appalachian dialect is one of the five or six distinctive regional dialects recognized by linguists in the United States (Wolfram and Fasold 1974). The dialect includes distinctive phonological and grammatical features, including retaining the initial ""h"" in auxiliaries and pronouns (""h'it"" for ""it"") and the use of variant pronouns (""hisself"" for ""himself"" and ""you'uns"" for ""all of you""). Recent scholarship by Anita Puckett (2000) explores additional linguistic features unique to Appalachian English, including the general prohibition against using imperatives. Foremost among religious studies scholars expounding the uniqueness of Appalachian religion is Deborah McCauley (1995), whose book Appalachian Mountain Religion depicts the historical divergence between modern mainstream American Protestantism and Appalachian mountain religion. This distinctiveness is grounded in theological differences concerning the centrality of ""experience"" beyond ""belief"" and derives from the pietistic phase of the Reformation. In common with southern evangelical traditions, mountain an provoke most Appalachian scholars, both those who believe in that cultural religion emphasizes the personal conversion experience initiated by God's grace through the Holy Spirit (being ""born again""). This emphasis goes beyond mainstream Protestantism's focus on the primacy of a human-initiated, rational choice of faith and its expression through achievement, self-control, and moral living (""being good"") as the means to achieve eternal life. As Humphrey points out, mainstream Christianity is grounded in a rational critical consciousness emerging from the Enlightenment with ""a passion for doctrine, logic, and systems"" (1984, 136). Evangelical religious experience, on the other hand, holds out the possibility of instantaneous conversion. McCauley (1991) characterizes this centrality of grace as ""the heart of Appalachian mountain religion."" McCauley (1995) traces other distinctive aspects of mountain religious life including normative values of humility and grace, a nonrationalist and emotive mode of religious experience with an ""emphasis on the heart rather than the head,"" prophetic rather than charismatic preachers, the independent church polity, and regionally unique aspects of the worship service. Most of these religious features, of course, are characteristic of evangelical Protestantism in general as it emerged during the Great Awakening in eighteenth-century America. This form of Protestantism is common throughout the South and the Midwest, forming the backbone of the political movement often called social conservatism or the Moral Majority. As such, it underlies the thinking of perhaps 30 to 40 percent of the American population. While this religious orientation is, therefore, not uniquely Appalachian, its values and practices resonate throughout the whole of mountain culture. As McCauley states, pietism is ""reflected not just in mountain church traditions but in basic sensibilities representing much of popular religious culture throughout the Appalachian region, whether church attendance is involved or not. In fact, pietists have likely had far greater impact on the religious life distinctive to the mountains of the Appalachian region than on the religious life - other than, of course, their own - of any other region in the United States, large or small"" (1995, 161). Many of these same arguments hold when discussing religious healing in the southern mountains. Religious healing is not unique to Appalachian peoples, nor is it unique to American Protestants, nor, indeed, to Christianity in general. However, religious healing as it is commonly practiced among mountain peoples can only be understood within the cultural web of mountain l ife. The r ituals and practices rely on stable communities in which trusted personal relationships and strong connections to people and place are constructed over time. The religious belief system that provides meaning for these rituals and practices (""Appalachian mountain religion"") predominates in the largely rural landscape of stable communities in the Appalachian region. A host of varieties of Baptist, Pentecostal, Holiness, and other small, independent, nondenominational churches provide the primary venue for the practice of these religious beliefs, but the values are manifested throughout mountain culture. Serious illness provides the catalyst for significant social rituals in these churches, and one consequence of these rituals is to provide an opportunity for the community to reinforce its identity and shared heritage. Even nonbelievers in rural mountain communities may be drawn into religious rituals when sudden illness or a tragic accident strikes their family and the community responds with prayer vigils. Members of the community gather together to provide comfort and aid to the sick, to the family members of those who are ill, and to one another. During such public events, the community reaffirms fundamental cultural values that serve to define mountain people, including individualism, egalitarianism, personalism, familism, and neighborliness (Beaver 1992 [1986]; Keefe 1998). Insofar as this value system contrasts with that of mainstream America, it also contributes to cultural boundary maintenance and the perpetuation of a unique ethnic identity among mountain people. © 2003 by University of Alabama Press.

"""Pleasure by description"": Elizabeth singer Rowe's enlightened Milton","Alexander Pope's 1713 recipe for an epic poem advises that for the language, ""it will do well to be an Imitator of Milton, for you'll find it easier to imitate him in this than any thing else.""1 As Pope's mockery made clear, even early in Milton's afterlife, his peculiar use of language spawned a generation of bad imitation in the eighteenth century. The Tory Anglican Francis Peck, who dared to write a Miltonic imitation in an encomium to Queen Anne, cataloged in his New Memoirs of the Life and Poetical Works of Mr. John Milton some 49 features of the Miltonic style, complete with examples and admiration, especially calling attention to his obscure, Latinate or archaic vocabulary, the excessive use of circumlocutions and syntactic inversions. When R. D. Havens explored the influence of Milton on English poetry in a 1922 study, the primary elements of his analysis were also diction and versification. Blank verse was an obvious starting point, and yet to write unrhymed lines was not enough to distinguish an author as ""Miltonic""; what the non-Miltonics missed, according to Havens, was his prosody: the irregular breaks within the lines, his diction and vocabulary, a penchant for obscure, Latinate and obsolete words.2 The diction peculiar to the poet gloried in inversions, repetitions and circumlocutions, but came to be disliked amongst twentieth century critics in the great ""Milton controversy.""3 While recently students of Milton's Whig or radical legacy have focused on the content of his works and on Milton's ""Visionary poetics,"" here I shall return to the question of poetic style, exploring how ""style"" itself could contribute to a radical, dissenting literary tradition, suggesting additional directions for accounting for Miltonic radicalism in the eighteenth century. The Miltonic ""style"" bore contradictory political or ideological meanings, serviceable to a variety of occasions and interests, even as his political identity remained clearly antimonarchical during this time. This essay looks at one experience of Milton's stylistic influence upon one Whig writer, Elizabeth Singer Rowe (1674- 1737), who, writing her Miltonic imitation well before the Romantic Milton of James Thomson and Joseph Warton, saw Milton not as the arid exponent of a dead language, but rather as the poet of nature, sublimely infused with God's inspiration. Rowe's is among the many now-forgotten names compounded in John Shawcross's collection of Milton criticism from the eighteenth century as an imitator of Milton's ""style.""4 Elizabeth Singer Rowe disrupts the story told by feminist historians of political thought of a demonized liberal or republican tradition; her first publication praised the Glorious Revolution, showering King William in glory in 1691 with her ""Upon King William's Passing the Boyne,"" which announced her poetic ambition to sing for the Protestant king. Admirers called her ""Madam Laureate.""5 Ever loyal to that monarch, even when radical Whigs were abandoning him, Rowe was committed to his internationalist, militant Protestant vision. Her poems sing repeatedly of the liberty of the English people, the self-restraint and valor of their leaders, and praise the violence of military success against Jacobites, the French, and themselves, in a moral and political campaign against the decadence and irreligion of the times. A patriotic poem on the great Whig hero-martyr John Hampden (""his soul with freedom fir'd"") remains in manuscript among her works.6 As if imitating Milton's career, Rowe penned ""A Pastoral on the Nativity of our Saviour,"" which contains Miltonic echoes. Of interest here is her ""A Description of Hell. In Imitation of Milton,"" which will be an excellent case through which to investigate what counted as ""Miltonic"" in the early eighteenth century, as well as to investigate how a woman writer coped with the legacy of that strong forebear. Writing in the Miltonic tradition, Rowe seems not at all interested in the matter of Eve's responsibility for the Fall, as so many women were in ages succeeding Milton; indeed, her interests were moral, social, literary and political. If in Feminist Milton Joseph Wittreich has directed our view to Milton's female readers in order to explode the caricature of Milton as the woman writer's Bogey, this essay turns from a feminist Milton to a political Milton in the hands of a feminist. Rowe's feminism is not in a pro-woman reading of Milton; rather, the feminism is Rowe's assertion of her right to write as a woman, to inherit a major writer in her own attempts at epic verse. With Rowe, we see how the Whig Milton could be, in addition to a defender of political liberty, also a religious Dissenter. Elizabeth Singer was born in Somerset in 1674, the eldest of three daughters of Walter Singer, a nonconformist minister, and his wife Elizabeth Portness. Her father, who had a fair estate in the neighborhood of Frome, had been imprisoned in his early life for nonconformity and he first met his wife when she was visiting prisoners there as an act of charity. Elizabeth was educated religiously, practiced music and drawing, and wrote verse from an early age, including a feminist screed defending her authority as a poet against traditional ""polite"" women's learning.7 In 1694 and 1695 she was anonymously published in John Dunton's Athenian Mercury, and her Poems on Several Occasions by Philomela was brought out, also anonymously, in 1696. Included among her suitors and friends were pious men, the poet Matthew Prior, the nonjuring Bishop Ken, the Dissenter Isaac Watts, and the New England divine, Benjamin Colman. When she married, it was in 1710 to Thomas Rowe, 13 years her junior, son and grandson of ejected Nonconformist ministers. Thomas was a classicist and staunch Whig writer, having translated Plutarch's Lives with its biographies of antityrannical heroes. The couple moved to London; her husband died in 1715 and was buried in the great Nonconformist burial ground in London, at Bunhill fields. After her husband's death, Rowe returned to Frome where she had inherited a small property from her father, remaining there for the rest of her life, writing devotional poetry and publishing these and other literary works, while maintaining a close friendship with Frances Thynne, the countess of Hertford, later duchess of Somerset. Rowe died in 1737; her Miscellaneous Works in Prose and Verse were published in two volumes in 1739.8 A devout dissenter, Rowe spent half her yearly income in charity, in support of her Rook Lane Congregational Meeting at Frome, where she spent most of her life and where she was buried next to her father. Rowe's poetry developed from youthful lyric effusions published by John Dunton to the mature writing of a ten-book biblical heroic poem; she was enamored of the Italians, translated bits of Tasso and made adaptations of Ovid, Crashaw, Drayton and a biblical paraphrase of Song of Songs. With her poetic meditations and experiments in narrative fiction, Rowe crossed the genres of poetry and prose. She was well regarded in her own day; in response to her Pindaric ode, the ""Athenians"" hailed her as William III's laureate; Elizabeth Carter saw her as a spokesperson for all women; the major publisher John Dunton was ever a backer. Her literary ambitions were great, and her tenbook biblical poem The History of Joseph (1736) was a publishing success, running to seven editions, including a German translation.9 Elizabeth Singer Rowe was an avid reader of Milton. In letters to her friends, in her poetic allusions and in her poetic form, Rowe looked to Milton as a model; he was enough of an everyday companion that she cited him to greet the morning, quoted him while moralizing to her sister-in-law, and noted her eagerness for the arrival of Signor Rolli's Italian translation. In an age where the rhyming couplet reigned supreme, Rowe wrote 42 blank verse poems, her ""Soliloquies,"" and she overtly imitated Milton in her ""Description of Hell,"" first published in 1704.10 Rowe's very literary identity was founded upon Milton's - her pen name, ""Philomela,"" was chosen after Milton's figure in Il Penseroso, and she used it in publications in John Dunton's Athenian Mercury in the 1690s as well as in her romantic correspondence with her husband.11 In a letter, Rowe recollects a young lady who was so absorbed in reading Milton in the park that she did not notice her approaching lover.12 Rowe was an excellent devotional poet; in stressing her position as a woman writer, and ignoring her political and religious aims, her recent biographers have misunderstood the power of that religiosity to achieve a radical identity.13 In exploring Rowe as a reader of Milton, I hope to understand how Milton's was not simply an aesthetic style to imitate, but a set of concerns, an orientation toward the natural world and its inhabitants, and a moral perspective on artistic creation.

The guitar in country music,"The guitar has always played a primary role in the composition, performance, and image of country music. The steel-string acoustic guitar, or “flat-top,” provided the rhythmic and harmonic foundation in the original string bands and has since been included in all country music recordings and performances without exception. In North America, the acoustic guitar has become a symbol not only of country music, but of traditionalism, rural values, “down-homeness,” and a folk-based ideology. The authenticity of a country music performance depends upon stylistic variables that combine to create a personal musical experience both for the audience and for the performer. Musical elements such as vocal sound, subject, performance practice, and instrumentation merge with iconographic ones such as boots, cowboy hats, pedal steel guitar, and acoustic guitar in order to maintain this authenticity and produce the genre recognized by audiences as country music. The traditionalism associated with the acoustic guitar lives on in the repertory of folk songs, ballads, dances, and instrumental pieces brought to North America by Anglo-Celtic immigrants during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. British folk culture came to all regions of English-speaking North America, and pockets of tradition still exist in such places as rural New England, Appalachia, and the Maritime provinces of Canada. By the same token, country music is deeply rooted in the folklore of British broadside ballads, which were transported to the New World and gained life as “Americana.” It speaks to its audience from a rural perspective and serves as a vehicle for tapping into and assessing public opinion, relating personal experience, and commenting on situations or events. © Cambridge University Press 2003.",0
Wild Ocean: An interview with Horatiu Radulescu,"This text is a much shortened transcription of an interview by the author with the composer Horatiu Radulescu, recorded in Freiburg, Germany, in 1996. The text preserves the unique flavour of Radulescu's spoken English in an attempt to convey something of the multi-lingual nature of his thought. A secondary text has been added, made up mostly from statements by Radulescu himself and by various performers, musicologists and critics who have written about his music, to provide supplementary material illuminating further the issues that arise in the interview. The discussion centres around Radulescu's development of the spectral technique of composition in the late 1960s and its application in his music.",0
Synchronizing with Music: Intercultural Differences,"The way in which listeners perceive music changes throughout childhood, but little Is known about the factors responsible for these changes. One factor, explicit music training, has received considerable attention, with studies indicating that musicians demonstrate a more complex hierarchical mental representation for music and superior temporal organizational skills. But does acculturation - the passive exposure to a particular type of music since birth - also influence the acquisition of these skills? We compared the music synchronization performance of Tunisian and French subjects with music from these two contrasting musical cultures. Twelve musical excerpts were selected from the two popular music cultures, matched for perceived tempo, complexity, and familiarity, and subjects were asked to tap in time with the music. Tapping mode (rate and hierarchical level) varied with subjects' familiarity with the musical idiom, as evidenced by an interaction between musical culture and type of music: participants synchronized at higher hierarchical levels (and over a wider range) with music from their own culture than with an unfamiliar type of music. Thus, passive acculturation as well as explicit music tuition influence our perception and cognition of music.",0
Localized morphological brain differences between English-speaking Caucasians and Chinese-speaking Asians: New evidence of anatomical plasticity,"Deformation field morphometry was applied to magnetic resonance images to detect differences in brain shape between English-speaking Caucasians and Chinese-speaking Asians. Anatomical differences between these two groups were limited to gyri in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which are known (through functional imaging studies) to differentiate Chinese speakers from English speakers. We interpret these anatomical differences as evidence of neural plasticity shaped by the process of language acquisition during childhood. While anatomical plasticity due to manual skill acquisition (e.g. in musicians) has been established, to our knowledge this is the first report of a brain anatomical difference attributable to a learned cognitive strategy. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",0
An investigation of vocal pitch behaviors of Hong Kong children,"The present study is an investigation of the plausibility of a link between first spoken language and the use of vocal pitch in speaking and singing. Comparisons were made between the use of pitch in the speech and songs among three groups of Hong Kong children, who were English monolinguals, Cantonese monolinguals, and Cantonese/English bilinguals. Speech and songs of 60 children age 3 and 4 were collected and acoustic analyses were performed to extract pitch. All children in the study used pitch to distinguish cognitively between their speech and songs. English monolinguals made wider differences between the fundamental frequency (F0) means for songs and speech compared to the two other language groups. Differences between the F0 means for the criterion and the own choice song were statistically significant in both age groups across languages, suggesting the performance of the two songs might have been very different for these children. English monolinguals had the highest F0 means for both songs, followed by the Cantonese/English bilinguals and then the Cantonese monolinguals. Findings of the study provide evidence of language differences in vocal pitch behaviors for speech and song production.",0
Strategies and questions at stake for the creation of a capes of creole,"The Creole language, in all its different dialectal forms, is spoken by about ten million people in the Americas and the Indian Ocean. Two million of them belong to the French Overseas Departments (DOM) including Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion. For three centuries, Creole, the only language of the black slaves, livedmainly in an oral form, from which grew an outstanding oral literature (tales, riddles, proverbs, songs⋯ ), and this, in spite of the fact that Creole was only written, sporadically, from the middle of the 18th century. This situation, described as « diglossia » in 1959 by Charles Ferguson, similar in many ways to that of Catalonia or Occitania (Provencal), wasn't without repercussions both in schooling and on an identity level. Indeed, the ousting of Creole from the educational sphere caused a massive failure of pupils from the working class. Gradually, it forced the institution to think about new approaches with regard to teaching French, approaches quite similar to those implemented in Black Africa, such as « French as a second language » or « French as a foreign language ».At the same time, diverse cultural and political trends, of nationalistic allegiance, took the question of restoring the full value of the vernacular language, very seriously, giving it all the necessary linguistic equipment (spelling, grammar, dictionaries, pedagogical guides⋯). These efforts led to the creation of a bachelor's degree and master's degree in Creole at the University of the French West Indies and French Guiana at the beginning of the nineties and by a decree dated 9 February 2001, the creation by the French National Ministry of Education, a CAPES in Creole (the CAPES is the French national secondary school teaching certification exam).",0
Zouglou generation,"Offspring of the academic, social and political crisis that shakes out Côte-d'Ivoire as a whole, zouglou is a musical creation of students protesting against their society. Zouglou is sung in Ivorian popular French and in Nouchi, the French spoken by children of the street. Several factors contribute to widen its audience, giving to Côte-d'Ivoire the first national music of its history: the progressive elaboration of a repertory based on funny and humoristic songs; the social output of the topics ; the development of cassette radio that replaces the vinyl records; the support of national and international FM channels...",0
PMSI and French classification of child and teenage mental disorders,"The awaited relevance of the «PMSI» system in Child and Teenage Psychiatry will rely, for a great (the main) part, be dependant (reliant) on the quality of the collection of the pieces of information. As a as this subject is concerned, these elements can't be reduced to some criterious abusively set up as (raised to the status of) signifiants of isolated disorders. However, they come within (fit with) the complexity of the subject in his own story at the heart of the actions and procedures undertaken. Consequently the resort to a classification aiming at defining pathologies requires from this classification some qualities concerning the clinical strictness complexity and singularity of the described situations. The present classifications inspired by descriptive nosographical models patterns can't claim too this precision in the data acquisition of complex pieces of information, with the notable exception of the French Classification of Child et Teenage Mental Disorders (Classification française des troubles mentaux de l'enfant et de l'adolescent). With the ordering of these axes, the place reserved to psychopathological understanding among a strict clinic, the reference to the environment and to the subject's story constitue a referential construction respectful of the clinic preserving the originality and complexity of situations. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",0
A cross-language comparison of preschool children's vocal fundamental frequency in speech and song production,Pitch is a psychoacoustic concept that has distinctive functions in speech and music across languages. The present investigation is based on a hypothesis that speakers of tonal and non-tonal languages may have distinctive vocal pitch behaviours. Ethnographic observations was conducted on the vocal development of a group of English and Chinese Canadian children over 42 months. Acoustic analyses were performed on recorded vocalizations to extract pitch. Comparisons of longitudinal vocal fundamental frequencies between the Chinese and English speaking children suggest possible language differences in the use of pitch to distinguish between speech and song production. Implications on strategies to provide more effective singing experience in a multicultural classroom are discussed.,0
"Accessibility of spoken, written, and sign language in Landau-Kleffner syndrome: A linguistic and functional MRI study","Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is an acquired aphasia which begins in childhood and is thought-to arise from an epileptic disorder within the auditory speech cortex. Although the epilepsy usually subsides at puberty, a severe communication impairment often persists. Here we report on a detailed study of a 26-year old, left-handed male, with onset of LKS at age 5 years, who is aphasic for English but who learned British Sign Language (BSL) at age 13. We have investigated his skills in different language modalities, recorded EEGs during wakefulness, sleep, and under conditions of auditory stimulation, measured brain stem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEP), and performed functional MRI (fMRI) during a range of linguistic tasks. Our investigation demonstrated severe restrictions in comprehension and production of spoken English as well as lip-reading, while reading was comparatively less impaired. BSL was by far the most efficient mode of communication. All EEG recordings were normal, while BAEP showed minor abnormalities, fMRI revealed: 1) powerful and extensive bilateral (R > L) activation of auditory cortices in response to heard speech, much stronger than when listening to music; 2) very little response to silent lip-reading; 3) strong activation in the temporo-parieto-occipital association cortex, exclusively in the right hemisphere (RH), when viewing BSL signs. Analysis of these findings provides novel insights into the disturbance of the auditory speech cortex which underlies LKS and its diagnostic evaluation by fMRI, and underpins a strategy of restoring communication abilities in LKS through a natural sign language of the deaf (with Video).",0
Students teach students,"Distance learning experiments in mathematics and science education as well as in art education in Japan have initiated considerable increase in creativity of pupils, improvement of scholarship, and growth in understanding cultural characteristics of different regions. Based on these experiments, an environment for German-Japanese school education projects using real time interactive audio-visual distance learning between remote classrooms has been established. This has been done with elementary school children speaking in their native languages, translated by interpreters on the topics of symmetries in rectangles and stripes. It has been done with lower secondary students speaking in English on topics related to discovering, proving, and applying the Pythagorean Theorem. Another project is underway now with four pairs of Berlin and Tokyo schools, co-operating in environmental education, Japanese language education, literature (haiku), and music education. In these experiments, the pupils take over the teaching, a method that will be more and more important in the future of learning. Initiated and supervised by their teachers, the pupils select problems from some subject matter, they explore the Internet, and in groups of 2 or 3 they prepare teaching clips for their peers in the foreign country. This technique brings about both progress in personal learning as well as deep mutual understanding in difficulties and aptitudes of the learning partners. © 2001 by Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0
"Name and filiation in reunion island, from the historical to the clinical","Reunion Island, which was deserted until 1665, was populated by successive waves of immigration following colonisation with the arrival of settlers, the development of slavery, then of indenture. In the last decades, thanks to modernisation and economic growth resulting from the change from colony to department status, Reunion Island has become a centre of attraction in the Indian Ocean. The current population, with its multi-ethnic origins, is a veritable kaleidoscope of intermingling beliefs, customs, languages, etc. This diversity has always been at the heart of Creole families and is the vector of values, skills, property and names. But, at the same time, it causes problems, fosters secrets, provokes conflict and leads to fractures. How does each individual stand in terms of transmission (receiving/giving) and links (bonding/unbonding) in the context of plural-identity families ? The complexity and dynamics of each situation give rise to the singularity and richness, but also sometimes to the fragility and suffering of each family. In order to gain a clearer insight into filiation, this study is based on research into family names. There are two main lines of study : - history and legislation (application of the Code Noir or Negro Laws, emigration patterns and the transformation of names to suit French civil status requirements, etc.) ; - the results of clinical study into child psychopathology (consideration of everything relevant to the child's name in therapy). The aim of this study is to analyse the symbolic function of the act of name-giving and the consequences of discrepancies in this identity-building process. For to be named is to take one's place among others and to be thus recognised, to experience sameness and otherness, to acquire a historical dimension, gaining access to dreams and fiction. To be named is to fit into a temporal framework, because names transcend time and are unaltered by racial mixity ; it is perhaps also a means of regaining some degree of happiness and freedom.",0
Modernity and the Singaporean adolescent,"This article investigates the effects of modernity on the purchase intentions of Singaporean adolescents. As a component of subjective norms, modernity had a positive impact on the purchase intention for party clothes among Singaporean Chinese teens. It was also found that the socioeconomic and cultural dimensions of modernity interacted with attitude and subjective norm. Specifically, attitude had a greater effect and subjective norm had less influence on the purchase intention for party clothes among more modern teens who resided in private homes and were English speaking than those who lived in public housing and were non-English speaking. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",0
Student song preference in the elementary music class,"In 1996, the Music Educators National Conference (now MENC-The National Association for Music Education) published a list of 42 songs that ""every American should know"" as part of a nationwide campaign to promote singing. The purpose of the present study was to determine student preferences for several songs on the list, as well as how familiarity with a song may be related to that preference. In addition, possible interactions of gender, grade level, language spoken at home, rehearsal, and self-evaluations of singing were also examined. Ten songs, all limited to a one-octave range, were selected from the MENC list of songs. Subjects (N =160) were nine intact classes of third, fourth, and fifth graders (three classes at each grade level) in an urban school. During their regularly scheduled music class, subjects listened to the 10 recorded songs and rated each on a 5-point Likert-type scale for both preference and familiarity. In 10 subsequent classes, each song (one song per class) was rehearsed for 10 minutes, followed by another preference rating and a self-evaluation of performance quality. This investigation examined possible relationships between students' familiarity with a song and their subsequent preference for the song. Correlations for individual songs ranged from .40 to .64 with a mean correlation over all 10 songs at .57. A significant difference (p<.01) between grade levels was found for both familiarity and preference. The youngest subjects responded most positively. Boys indicated a consistent decline in both song familiarity and preference from Grades 3 to 5. Grade level, gender, and language spoken at home (English or Spanish) interacted significantly (p<.01) in their effect on song preference for these elementary students. Mean preference ratings were consistently higher after the 10-minute rehearsal with one exception (""De Colores""). The student subjects rated themselves consistently high in self-evaluations of singing. © 1999 by MENC-The National Assocation for Music Education.",0
The rhythm of language: Fostering oral and listening skills in singapore pre-school children through an integrated music and language arts program,"The Expressive Language and Music Project (ELM) was initiated at the National Institute of Education in 1996. Its primary aim was to develop an integrated language and music program for preschool children in order to enhance their oral language competency in English. Twelve kindergarten children attended weekly sessions on campus, for a year, where they participated in a wide variety of language arts and musical activities (based on the Orff and Kodaly approaches to the teaching of music). The natural communicative setting and the creative use of resources and these activities, facilitated the children's task of acquiring English. At the end of the year all the children involved had made noticeable gains in language, music and social skills. © 1998 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association).",1

Teaching Literacy Through Rhyme and Rhythm,"Poems, songs and chants are excellent resources for developing competence in English for Aboriginal children who speak other languages at home. Children find rhythmic and repetitive language attractive and accessible. It is not unusual to hear children using the language over and over again in their play and, incidentally, teaching it to younger children in the community. As chunks of language are memorised, new language structures and vocabulary are also internalised. While there is very little commercial material available which is relevant to the interests and needs of remote Aboriginal children, it is a powerful learning activity for children to work with the teacher to create texts which reflect shared experiences. © 1996, Cambridge University Press.

"The relationship among self-esteem, acculturation, and recreation participation of recently arrived Chinese immigrant adolescents","This survey study investigated the relationships among self-esteem, acculturation and recreation participation among recently arrived Chinese immigrant adolescents. A total of 117 Chinese students in New York City, 58 males and 59 females from grades 9 through 12, completed the three questionnaires used in the study. Research findings showed that these students were at a low level of acculturation, but had a moderately high level of self-esteem. They participated most frequently in home/indoor activities and were attracted to various mass media using Chinese language and music. They often recreated with family members, Chinese friends or were alone in their free time. Boys participated significantly more often in sports while girls participated significantly more often in arts and crafts. School clubs and student organizations were the organizations with which these immigrant students most often affiliated. The perceived barriers to participation cited most often were lack of English proficiency, lack of opportunity, lack of partner and money and lack of knowledge about sites or information about activities. Both self-esteem and acculturation had a significant positive correlation with total level of recreation participation and a significant negative correlation with the total number of perceived barriers. Students with higher levels of self-esteem participated more often in recreation activities in the indoor/home-based, spectator, and outdoor activity categories. They also less often associated with non-Chinese people for recreation. Students with higher levels of acculturation participated more often in recreation activities and affiliated more often with organizations. No significant relationship was found between self-esteem and acculturation. Copyright 1996 National Recreation and Park Association.",0
Expressive Language Delay in a Toddler,"Shelly is a 20-month-old white female whose parents thought she was in excellent general health when she came to her pediatrician for a health supervision visit. A developmental survey consisting of focused questions revealed that Shelly spoke only occasionally with a vocabulary limited to five words. Although motor and social skills were age-appropriate, verbal expressions typically consisted of nonintelligable utterances and frequent pointing to objects. She occasionally chatters “as if she had her own language.” Shelly reportedly responds to directions appropriately, and she appears to hear normal human voices, music, and a telephone ring., Shelly has been in home day care since 10 months of age when her mother retumed to work. With four other toddlers, she is cared for by a Spanish-speaking caretaker; her parents speak English at home. She is the only child in her family; her parents remarked that they each had a sibling whose early language acquisition was delayed but as adults did not seem language impaired., Shelly's prenatal course was complicated by premature contractions treated from 30 weeks gestation with terbutaline. She was delivered at term by a spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications. Apgar scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes., On physical examination, Shelly appeared robust. Social and visual engagement occurred easily with her mother and the examiner. Growth parameters were at the 50th percentile. The examination was normal, including her tympanic membranes (normal appearance and compliance), palate, pharynx, facial structure, and neurological assessment. Gross and fine motor skills were documented at the 20− to 24-month level. She responded to commands given by her mother and the examiner. She was able to point to pictures of objects on request and correctly pointed to three body parts. When asked to “go get your shoes and sit down,” she completed the task after the second request. Throughout the interview and examination, Shelly did not say any specific words. However, she pointed to a toy and doll she wanted during a play situation. © 1995, Lippincott-Raven Publishers.

Impact of culturally sensitive AIDS video education on the AIDS risk knowledge of African-American adolescents,"AIDS video education is a major mode of providing information about the spread and prevention of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Very little has been written about the need for culturally salient messages in increasing the acquisition and retention of HIV/AIDS prevention information, even though there is considerable agreement that limited culturally sensitive information is reaching African-American youth. This investigation sought to ascertain the impact of a culturally similar AIDS video on the acquisition of AIDS knowledge and endorsement of HIV/AIDS prevention beliefs. This study randomly assigned classes of African-American teenagers to one of two treatment groups: culturally similar video (CSV) AIDS education and culturally dissimilar video (CDV) AIDS education. Results suggest that the CSV group demonstrated significant improvement in pre- to post- AIDS knowledge scores compared to the CDV group (using ANCOVA procedures). The intervention was not significant in demonstrating change in beliefs about prevention. Implications for the development of HIV/AIDS prevention programs for inner-city African-American youth are discussed.     Psychologists from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia randomly assigned 121 inner-city, African American adolescents into 2 AIDS Education groups. The Culturally Similar Video (CSV) group (experimental group) watched the video Don't Forget Sherrie, which had elements of similarity in terms of language (slang and black English), environment (urban setting), race (African American), fashion, life dilemmas (struggle between choosing mainstream and counterculture lifestyle), and modern background music. The control group watched a culturally dissimilar video (CDV). Before viewing, the 2 groups were similar in variables related to previous AIDS education. 17% of the CSV group and 14% of the CDV group received no formal AIDS education. In fact, the median hours of AIDS education for both groups was just 2 hours. These 2 figures indicate that urban youth receive limited or no formal AIDS education. The youth in the CSV group perceived the video more favorably than did those in the CDV group (score, 3.84 vs. 2.99; p = .04). Their pre- and post-AIDS knowledge scores improved significantly compared to those of the CDV group (score increase, 2.68 vs. 1.27; p .05). Both groups had similar levels of distress concerning HIV/AIDS presented via the video (score, 3.99 vs. 3.96). Their attitudes towards AIDS prevention practices, choice of safer options, and endorsement of culturally-based AIDS beliefs were also similar. These findings show that a CSV similar video intervention is more effective in improving AIDS knowledge for inner-city African American adolescents between pre- and postviewing than is a CDV. Even though the CSV did not have an effect on prevention or cultural beliefs or safer alternative options, the CSV youth did not perceive it to be any less threatening than the CDV. CSV youth believed the video would have been more effective had it shown someone living, struggling, and dying from AIDS and more people injecting drugs. Role playing, rehearsal, and drama may increase knowledge and motivation among these youth.",0
Song-induced ZENK gene expression in auditory pathways of songbird brain and its relation to the song control system,"The ZENK gene encodes a zinc-finger-containing transcriptional regulator and can be rapidly activated in songbird brain by presentation of birdsong (Mello et al., 1992). Here we map the areas of the songbird forebrain that show this genomic response to birdsong, using in situ hybridization. After 30 min of song presentation ZENK mRNA levels reach a peak in the caudomedial telencephalon, in areas adjacent to or closely related with primary auditory structures. These areas include subfields of field L (L1 and L3), the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM), the caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale (CMHV) anterior to field L, the caudal paleostriatum, and two field L targets, HVC shelf and RA cup. In contrast, ZENK induction is absent in some areas that show a response to song by other measures and where ZENK induction might have been expected. These include the direct thalamo-recipient field L subfield L2, and the nuclei of the circuit involved in the acquisition and production of learned song. These results demonstrate that ZENK induction following song presentation occurs only in a subset of areas physiologically activated by song, and draw attention to areas previously unsuspected as related to processing of complex auditory stimuli. Based on what is known about ZENK function in mammalian systems (Christy et al., 1989; Cole et al., 1989; Wisden et al., 1990), we speculate that areas revealed by ZENK induction might correspond to sites where critical neuronal modifications occur in response to birdsong presentation, possibly leading to the formation of song- related memories.",0
On the integration of multimedia applications in education,"Multimedia is a technology that is increasing affordable to secondary and primary schools because of the drop in the cost of hardware and the emergence of a variety of applications oriented to the professional and the consumer market at fair prices. After four years of experimentation and development with different brands of multimedia technology in the areas of geography and musical education, the Department of Education of the Catalunya region is now engaged in two multimedia projects based on MS-DOS computers with CD-ROM players and sound peripherals. The first of these projects is concerned with the integration of interactive multimedia applications in the learning of English as a foreign language in primary and secondary education levels. The second project is the development of a multimedia database on CD-ROM containing no more than 20,000 references of educational materials and a variety of factual materials addressed both to teachers and to students, with the aim of fostering project work and the development of information skills.",0
Comparing writing process and product across two languages: A study of 6 Singaporean university student writers,"A number of studies have attempted to probe the writing process of skilled and unskilled native and normative speakers of English. However, very few investigations of the writing process of students learning other languages have been published to date. This article reports a study of 6 Singaporean university students as they produced written texts in Japanese and, for comparison, in their primary written language (English or Chinese). The study examines process and product data separately to see if any relationship exists between an individual writer's process skill and product quality in the two languages. The findings indicate no clear relationship between process and product data in either language, nor between written products in the two languages. At the same time, the investigation uncovers a similarity in writing process for individual subjects across the two languages and a relationship between general level of proficiency in Japanese and the quality of the subjects' written products in that language. © 1993.",0
"A longitudinal study of primary teachers’ perceived competence in, and concerns about, national curriculum implementation","In 1989, a national questionnaire survey of 901 primary teachers was undertaken by the Leverhulme Primary Project team and published in Research Papers in Education (Wragg et al., 1989). A follow-up survey was conducted in 1991, with a sample size of 433 teachers in 131 schools. Teachers were asked on both occasions how competent they felt to teach the National Curriculum introduced by the 1988 Education Act with their existing subject knowledge. In 1989, whether results were analysed by school size, age of teacher, sex or age group taught, the rank order was similar. Teachers saw themselves as most competent in English and mathematics. Science, music and technology were rated lowest. In 1991, they still perceived themselves to be most competent in English and mathematics but science was elevated to third from eighth place. Music and technology, however, were ranked the lowest, as previously. Within subjects, science and technology show general improvements in personal competence whereas in English and mathematics the trend is to perceive these subjects to be more difficult to teach. Most teachers declared their priorities for future in-service training (INSET) as being in computers, information technology (IT) and the humanities. National assessment and testing was applied formally and publicly to year-2 children at the end of key stage 1 during the summer of 1991. The questionnaire was thus revised to obtain information of teachers’ experience with this process. The quality and nature of INSET and support given to teachers in relation to national testing, while geographically variable, was found to be generally lacking, with school and class routines substantially disrupted, and a preoccupation with assessment tending to drive the curriculum. There were increased pressures on time, increase in workload and evidence of high stress levels on the part of teachers. Year-2 children were substantially unaffected by the experience of National Curriculum assessment, although younger ones, according to teachers and heads, were neglected during the assessment period. Teachers in general were not opposed to the National Curriculum, but concerns about national assessment were dominant. Partly this is due to the change process itself and partly to procedural and structural difficulties encountered by teachers in some subject-specific areas and in conducting national assessment. The preferred assessment model itself in the eyes of teachers requires a reappraisal. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0

The taste for translation,"The author, 'bitten by the tarantula of translation', reflects upon the semantic and emotional aspects of certain psychoanalytic terms which have not yet received much attention. She is surprised at her intimate knowledge of German, spoken only in her early childhood, but which gives her an intuitive grasp of complex adult dialogue. Many questions are raised: an examination of the specific structure of German. What is a translator and to what extent is it possible for him to remain faithful to the sense and emotional content of German writers without producing unduly contorted French? How can a balance be struck between these two contrasting sound worlds? A comparison is made between a translator and the performer of a piece of music, between translator and psychoanalyst: in empathic resonance with text and patient.",0
Proper nouns as proper style-markers of poetry and prose,"Proper nouns have attracted little attention on the part of both linguists and lexicographers. Yet their referential and grammatical specificity in texts, their numerical importance, and their patterns of distribution endow them with considerable stylistic potential.The article begins with a study of the behaviour of proper nouns in a corpus of contemporary English poetry. All the figures and the relevant statistical tests (z-scores,χ2. etc.) point to a disturbingly abnormal distribution. Several possible explanations are envisaged and tested with a view to reconciling linguistic theory, the numerical data, and their statistical characteristics.The study goes on to relate these strictly quantitative findings with the textual behaviour of proper nouns in the actual poetic lines of the corpus as a whole. The first question addressed is whethere proper nouns can be considered as thematic stricto sensu in the texts at large. Closer attention is then brought to bear on the behaviour of proper nouns in both the sentence and the poetic line in order to emphasize their syntactic specificity with respect to the notions of theme (topic) and rheme (comment). Their metric importance, particularly their musical potential, is highlighted through an examination of their place in the line and the distribution of their occurrences in rhyming positions.The final section of the study examines the behaviour of proper nouns in three contemporary novels. An attempt is made to assess their syntactic and semantic roles within the individual sentences and the texts as artistic wholes. The results are contrasted with the findings concerning the poetic corpus and point to the preponderant influence of referential and functional parameters. One of the essential differences confirms R. Jakobson's intuitions on the supremacy of metaphor in poetry and metonymy in prose as the basic, primary principles of text-product. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",0
Russian and the Pre‐Literate Language Learner: On the Development of a Methodology,"ABSTRACT  When the author was asked to design an enrichment program in Russian language for four‐year‐olds and kindergartners, the available literature provided little assistance. Consequently, the experience became a laboratory in which to develop appropriate methods for teaching young learners. Lexical items were introduced and reviewed through visual aids, games, songs, and acting. Only grammatically correct material was utilized, although the issue of adjective‐noun agreement was generally avoided and only limited verb forms were presented. Discussion of cultural material contrasted the lives of Soviet and American children. Although few of the children will continue to study Russian in grade school, perhaps the program's greatest strength has been to help dispel some misconceptions about the Soviet Union © 1990 American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages",0

"Putting the Experience of the World at the Nation’s Command: Music at the Library of Congress, 1800–1917","Between 1800 and 1917 the music section at the Library of Congress grew from a few items in The Gentleman’s Magazine to almost a million items. The history of this development provides a unique view of the infant discipline of musicology and the central role that libraries played in its growth in the United States. Between 1800 and 1870 only 500 items were acquired by the music section at the Library of Congress. In 1870 approximately 36,000 copyright deposits (which had been accumulating at several copyright depositories since 1789) enlarged the music section by more than seventy fold. After 1870 the copyright process brought an avalanche of music items into the Library of Congress. In 1901 Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, hired American-born, German-educated Oscar Sonneck to be the second Chief of the Music Division. Together Putnam and Sonneck produced an ambitious acquisitions program, a far-sighted classification, cataloging, and shelving scheme, and an extensive series of publications. They were part of Putnam’s strategy to transform the Library of Congress from a legislative into a national library. Sonneck wanted to make American students of music independent of European libraries and to establish the discipline of musicology in the United States. Through easy access to comprehensive and diverse collections Putnam and Sonneck succeeded in making the Library of Congress and its music section a symbol of the free society that it served. © 1989, The American Musicological Society, Inc.

Primary teachers and the national curriculum,"A questionnaire survey of 901 primary teachers was undertaken by the Leverhulme Primary Project team. The sample was a national one which closely matched the national distribution of primary schools according to size and region. Teachers were asked to state how competent they felt to teach the national curriculum introduced by the 1988 Education Act with their existing subject knowledge. Whether results were analysed by the size of school, age of teacher, sex or age group taught, the rank order was similar. Teachers saw themselves as most competent in English with maths in second place. In last three places, with lowest perceived competence, were science, music and maths. The other subjects, art, geography, history, RE and PE were grouped in the middle. A similar response was found when teachers were asked to describe their competence on individual attainment targets in English, mathematics, music, science and design and technology. Greatest confidence in existing subject knowledge was expressed in the English and mathematics items. Infant teachers felt more competence in music than junior teachers, but the position was reversed for science and technology. Differences between men and women teachers emerged along traditional stereotypical lines, with women teachers expressing higher self-ratings in humanities and music and men a higher self-rating in science and technology. Though women gave themselves a slightly higher self-rating in mathematics overall, men rated themselves more highly on individual statements of mathematics attainment. Teachers more recently qualified rated themselves more highly competent in science than longer serving teachers, but not in subjects like geography, history and RE. In general teachers were not opposed to the national curriculum, but there were numerous references to the short timescale, their fears about shortage of resources, the personal strain that many felt, especially heads, and anxiety about assessment at the ages of seven and eleven. Most schools were already making extensive use of in-service days, staff meetings and the revision of policy documents in their preparation, but there is relatively little inter-school collaboration or use of local authority advisers. Teachers put forward courses on assessment and testing as their greatest in-service need, and also gave a high priority to two of the subjects they had previously expressed least competence in, science and technology, but assigned a low priority to another of their weakest subjects, music. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
"Nursery rhymes, phonological skills and reading","Nursery rhymes are an almost universal part of young English-speaking children's lives. We have already established that there are strong links between children's early knowledge of nursery rhymes at 3;3 and their developing phonological skills over the next year and a quarter. Since such skills are known to be related to children's success in learning to read, this result suggests the hypothesis that acquaintance with nursery rhymes might also affect children's reading. We now report longitudinal data from a group of 64 children from the age of 3;4 to 6; 3 which support this hypothesis. There is a strong relation between early knowledge of nursery rhymes and success in reading and spelling over the next three years even after differences in social background, I.Q and the children's phonological skills at the start of the project are taken into account. This raises the question of how nursery rhymes have such an effect. Our answer is that knowledge of nursery rhymes enhances children's phonological sensitivity which in turn helps them to learn to read. This paper presents further analyses which support the idea of this path from nursery rhymes to reading. Nursery rhymes are related to the child's subsequent sensitivity to rhyme and phonemes. Moreover the connection between knowledge of nursery rhymes and reading and spelling ability disappears when controls are made for differences in these subsequent phonological skills. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

Andries Bongcn (ca. 1732-1792) en de Franse invloed op de Amsterdamse kastenmakerij in de tweede helft van de achttiende eeuw,"As was the case with silversmiths (Note 3), many more cabinet-makers were wcrking in Amsterdam during the second half of the 18th century than in any other city in the Dutch Republic, the names of 195 of them being now known as opposed to 57 in The Hague and 32 in Rotterdam (Note 2). Most of those 195 names have been culled from the few surviving documents of the Guild of St. Joseph in Amsterdam, to which the cabinet-makers belonged (Note 4), supplemented by other sources, such as printed registers of craftsmen and shopkeepers (Note 6). Another important source is the newspaper the Amsterdamsche Courant with its advertisements placed by craftsmen themselves, with notices of sales, bankruptcies, lotteries and annual fairs and with advertisements concerning subsidiary or related trades. Since these advertisements were directed at the consumer, they often contain stylistic descriptions such as are not found elsewhere. Moreover, they aford valuable clues to archival material. Hence an investigation of all the advertisements from the years 1751-1800 has formed the basis for a study of Amsterdam cabinet-making, some results of which are presented here. Such a study is doomed largely to remain theoretical. The records can hardly ever be linked with surviving pieces, as these are virtually always anonymous since Amsterdam cabinet-makers were not required to stamp or sign their work. Moreover, only a few pieces of Dutch 18th-century furniture have a known provenance, so that it is only rarely possible to link a piece with a bill or another document and identify its maker. Thus it is not yet possible to form a reliable picture of a local Amsterdam style, let alone embark on attributions to individual makers (Note 8). In this light special importance may be attached to two commodes of the third quarter of the century which are exceptional in that they bear a signature, that of Andries Bongen (Figs. 1, 2, Notes 10, 11). These commodes, being entirely French-inspired, illustrate a specific and little-known aspect of Amsterdam cabinet-making. French furniture was so sought after in Amsterdam at that period that in 1771 a strict ban was imposed on its importation in order to protect local cabinet-makers (Note 12). It had begun to be imitated even before that and the commodes by Bongen exemplify this development. Andries Bongen, who was probably born in Geldern, south of Cleves and just east of the border of the Dutch Republic, is first recorded in Amsterdam in May 1763 on his marriage to Willemina, daughter of the smith Lambert van der Beek. He registered as a citizen on 5 July 1763 and became a master cabinet-maker some time between March 1763 and March 1764 (Note 19), so that, accordirtg to the Guild regulations, he must previously have trained for two years under an Amsterdam master (Note 20). At the time of his marriage he was living in St. Jorisstraat, but by the end of 1766 he had moved to Spui and between 1769 and 1771 he moved again, to Muiderpleinlje. When he and his wife made their will in 1772, their possessions were worth something under 8000 guilders (Note 23). This suggests that the business was quite flourishing, which seems to be confirmed by the fact that Bongen received a commission from the city of Amsterdam in 1771. Two more pieces were made for the city in 1786 and 1789, but in the latter year Bongen was declared bankrupt. The inventory of his possessions drawn up then (see Appeytdix) shows how parlous his conditions had become, his goods being valued at only 300 guilders. The reference to a shop indicates that Bongen sold his own furniture, although he had no stock to speak of at that point. The mention of eight work-benches, however, sugests that his output had previously been quite large. This is confirmed by the extent of his debts, notably that to the timber merchant Jan van Mekeren (Note 27). Other creditors included ‘Rudolfeus Eyk’, who probably supplied iron trelliszvork for bookcases and the like (Note 28), and the glass merchants Boswel en Zonen (Note 29) No debtors are listed and the only customer who can tentatively be identified is a ‘Heer Hasselaar’ who might be Pieter Cornelis Hasselaer (1720-95), several times burgomaster of Amsterdam between 1773 and 1794 (Note 30). Bongen died three years after his bankruptcy, at which time he was living in Nieuwe Looiersstraat. He appears to have continued working as a cabiytet-maker up to his death and his widow probably carried on the business until her own death in 1808, but nothing is known of this later period. The clearest insight into the character of part of Bongen’s output is aforded by the advertisement he placed in the Amsterdamsehe Courant of 4 December 1766, describing three pieces of furniture ‘in the French manner’. This is the first announcement by an 18th-century Amsterdam cabinet-maker of work in the French style. Bongen mentions two commodes decorated with floral marquetry, a technique which had flourished in Amsterdam in the late 17th and early 18th centuries (Note 34), but which had largely fallen into disuse on the advent around 1715 of a more sober type of furniture with plain walnut veneers on the English model (Note 36). In France a form of floral marquetry reappeared in the 1740s, being further developed in the following decade under the influence of Jean-FranÃ§ois Oeben (1721-63). From the late 1750s there are indications of the presence of pieces of French marquetry furniture in the new style in Amsterdam (Notes 42, 43). The earliest explicit description of floral marquetry appears in a sale catalogue of 5 June 1765 (Note 44), while in another of 25 March 1766 (Note 46) many French pieces are detailed. Obviously, then, Bongen was endeavouring to capture a share, of this new market. The reappearance of elaborate marquetry on Amsterdam-made furniture was the result of a desire to emulate the French examples. The two commodes described in Bongen’s advertisement can be identified with the one now in Amsterdam (Fig.2) and the one sold in London in 1947 (Fig.1). The latter still had more of its original mounts at the time nf the sale (Fig. 4) and the two probably formed a pair originally. The unusual fact that they are signed indicates that Bongen intended them to serve as show-pieces to demonstrate his skill at the beginning of his career (cf. Note 51, for another craftsman from abroad who began his career in Amsterdam by similarly advertising a spectacular piece). The commode in Amsterdam, with all its original mounts, demonstrates most clearly how close Bongen came to French prototypes, although his work has many personal traits nonetheless. In the marquetry the vase on a plinth on the front and the composition of the bouquets on the sides are notable (Fig.5), as are the large, full-blown blooms. The carcase, made entirely of oak, is remarkably well constructed and has a heavy, solid character. The commodes are outstanding for the complete integration of the marquetry and the mounts, in the manner of the finesl French furniture. The mounts presenl a problem, as it is not clear where they were made. They do not appear to be French or English, but one hesitates to attribute them to Amsterdam, as it is clear from documentary material that ornamental furniture-mounts were hardly ever made there in the second half of the 18th century. The mounts advertised by Ernst Meyrink in 1752 (Note 53) were probably still of the plain variety of the early part of the century and there is no further mention of mounts made in Amsterdam in the Amsterdamsche Courant. Once, in 1768, the silversmith J. H. Strixner placed an advertisement which refers to their gilding (Note 55). There is virtually no indication either of French mounts being imported and there is little Dutch furniture of this period that bears mounts which are indisputably French. In contrast to this, a large number of advertisements from as early as 1735 show that many mounts were imported from England, while among English manufacturers who came to sell their wares in Amsterdam were Robert Marshall of London (Note 60), James Scott (Note 61), William Tottie of Rotterdam (Note 62), whose business was continued after his death by Klaas Pieter Sent (Note 64), and H. Jelloly, again of Rotterdam (Notes 66, 67). It seems surprising that in a period when the French style reigned supreme so many mounts were imported from England, but the English manufacturers, mainly working in Birmingham, produced many mounts in the French style, probably often directed expressly at foreign markets. On the two commodes by Bongen only the corner mounts and the handles are of types found in the trade-catalogues of the English manufacturers (Figs. 7, 8, Notes 65, 70). The corner mounts are of a common type also found on French furniture (Note 71), so they doubtless copy a French model. The remaining mounts, however, are the ones which are so well integrated with the marquetry and these are not found elsewhere. Recently a third commode signed by Bongen has come to light, of similar character to the first two (Fig.3). Here all the mounts are of types found in the catalogues (Figs.7-10, Note 72). Apparently Bongen could not, or did not choose to, obtain the special mounts any more, although he clearly wanted to follow the same design (Fig. 6). This third commode was undoubtedly made somewhal later than the other two. The marquetry on it is the best preserved and it is possible to see how Bongen enlivened it with fine engraving. Because this piece is less exceptional, it also allows us to attribute some unsigned pieces to Bongen on the basis of their closeness to it, namely a commode sold in London in 1962 (Fig.11, Note 73) and two smaller, simpler commodes, which may originally have formed a pair, one sold in London in 1967 (Fig.12, Nole 74) and the other in a Dutch private collection (Figs.13, 14). The first one has a highly original marquetry decoration of a basket of flowers falling down. On the sides of this piece, and on the front of the two smaller ones, are bouquets tied with ribbons. These were doubtless influenced by contemporary engravings, but no direct models have been identified. The construction of the commode in the Netherlands tallies completely with tltat of the signed example in Amsterdam. The mounts are probably all English, although they have not all been found in English catalogues (Fig.15, Note 76). A seventh commode attributable to Bongen was sold in Switzerland in 1956 (Fig.16, Note 77). It is unusual in that walnut is employed as the background for the floral marquetry, something virtually unknown in Paris, but not uncommon on German work of French inspiration (Note 78). That commodes constitute the largest group among the furniture in the French style attributable to Bongen should cause no surprise, for the commode was the most sought after of all the pieces produced by the Ã©bÃ©nistes not only in France, but all over Europe. Two other pieces which reveal Bongen’s hand are two tables which look like side-tables, but which have fold-out tops to transform them into card-tables, a type seldom found in France, but common in England and the Netherlands (Note 80). One is at Bowhill in Scotland (Figs.17, 19, 20), the other was sold in London in 1972 (Fig.18, Note 79). The corner mounts on the Bowhill table, which probably also graced the other one originally, are the same as those on the two small commodes, while the handles are again to be found in an English catalogue (Fig.21, Note 81). What sounds like a similar card-table was sold at auction in Amsterdam in 1772 (Note 82). In Bongen’s advertisement of 1766 mention is also made of a secretaire, this being the first appearance of this term in the Amsterdamsche Courant and Bongen finding it necessary to define it. No secretaire is known that can be attributed to him. A medal-cabinet in the form of a secretaire in Leiden (Figs.22, 23) hasfloral marquetry somewhat reminiscent of his work, but lacking its elegance, liveliness and equilibrium. Here the floral marquetry is combined with trompe l’oeil cubes and an interlaced border, early Neo-Classical elements which were first employed in France in the 1750s, so that this piece represents a later stage than those attributable to Bongen, which are all in a pure Louis xvstyle. Virtually identical in form to the medal-cabinet is a secretaire decorated solely with floral marquetry (Fig. 24, Note 87). This also appears not to be by Bongen, but both pieces may have been made under his influence. The picture we can form of Bongen’s work on the basis of the signed commodes is clearly incomplete. His secretaire was decorated with ‘4 Children representing Trade’, an exceptionally modern and original idea in 1766 even by French standards (Note 88). His ambitions in marquetry obviously wentfar beyondflowers, but no piece has yet beenfound which evinces this, nor is anything known of the Neo-Classical work which he may have produced after this style was introduced in Amsterdam around 1770. Bongen may perhaps have been the first Amsterdam cabinet-maker to produce marquetry furniture in the French style, but he was not to remain the only one. In 1771 and 1772 furniture in both the Dutch and French mode was advertised for sale at the Kistenmakerspand in Kalverstraat, where all furniture-makers belonging to the Guild of St. Joseph could sell their wares (Note 89). The ‘French’ pieces were probably decorated with marquetry. Only a small number of cabinet-makers are known to have worked in this style, however. They include Arnoldus Gerritsen of Rheestraat, who became a master in 1769 and sold his stock, including a ’small French inlaid Commode’, in 1772, and Johan Jobst Swenebart (c.1747 - active up to 1806 or later), who became a master in 1774 and advertised in 1775 that he made ‘all sorts of choice Cabinet- and Flower-works’, the last term referring to furniture decorated with floral marquetry. Not only French types of furniture, but also traditional Dutch pieces were now decorated with French-inspired marquetry, for example a collector’s cabinet advertised in 1775 by Johan Jacob Breytspraak (c.1739-95), who had become a master in 1769-70; a bureau-bookcase, a form introduced in the first half of the century probably under English influence (Note 100), exhibited in 1772 (Note 99); and a display cabinet for porcelain supplied, though not necessarily made, by Pieter Uylenburg en Zoon in 1775 (Notes 101, 102). Even long-case clocks were enriched with marquetry, witness the one advertised by the clock-maker J. H. KÃ¼hn in 1775 and another by him which was sold by auction in Edam in 1777 (Note 104). The latter was, like the bureau-bookcase exhibited in 1772, decorated with musical instruments, again a motif borrowed from France, where it was used increasingly from the 1760s onwards (Note 105). A clock signed by the Amsterdam clock-maker J. George GrÃ¼ning also has a case with marquetry of musical instruments. This must date from about 1775-80, but its maker is unknown (Fig. 25, Notes 106, 107). All four of the Amsterdam cabinet-makers known to have done marquetry around 1770 came from Germany and all were then only recently established in Amsterdam. In fact half of the 144 Amsterdam cabinet-makers working in the second half of the 18th century whose origins it has been possible to trace came from Germany, so the German element was even stronger there than in Paris, where Germans comprised about a third of the Ã©bÃ©nistes (Note 108) and where they had again played an important role in the revival of marquetry. None qf the four in Amsterdam was exclusively concerned with marquetry. Indeed, for some of them it may only have been a secondary aspect of their work. This was not true of Bongen, but he too made plain pieces, witness the four mahogany gueridons he made for the city of Amsterdam in 1771 or the two cupboards also made for the city in 1786 and 1789 (Notes 111, 112).No marquetry is listed in his inventory either. Perhaps fashions had changed by the time of his bankruptcy. Such scant knowledge as we have of Amsterdam cabinet-making between 1775 and 1785 certainly seems to suggest this. In the descriptions of the prizes for furraiture-lotteries, such as took place regularly from 1773 onwards (Note 114), marquetry is mentioned in 1773 and 1775 (Notes 115, 116), but after that there is no reference to itfor about tenyears. Nor is there any mention of marquetry in the very few cabinet-makers’ advertisements of this period. When the clock-maker KÃ¼hn again advertised long-case clocks in 1777 and 1785, the cases were of carved mahogany (Notes 121, 122). Certainly in France the popularity of marquetry began to wane shortly before 1780 and developments in the Netherlands were probably influenced by this. Towards the end of the 1780s, however, pieces described as French and others decorated with ‘inlaid work’ again appear as prizes in lotteries, such as those organized by Johan Frederik Reinbregt (active 1785-95 or later), who came from Hanover (Note 128), and Swenebart. The latter advertised an inlaid mahogany secretaire in 1793 (Note 132) and similar pieces are listed in the announcement of the sale of the stock of Jean-Matthijs Chaisneux (c.1734-92), one of a small group of French upholsterers first mentioned in Amsterdam in the 1760s, who played an important part in the spread of French influence there (Note 134). In this later period, however, reference is only made to French furniture when English pieces are also mentioned, so a new juxtaposition is implied and ‘French’ need not mean richly decorated with marquetry as it did in the 1760s. In fact the marquetry of this period was probably of a much more modest character. A large number of pieces of Dutch furniture in the late Neo-Classical style are known, generally veneered with rosewood or mahogany, where the marquetry is confined to trophies, medallions on ribbons, geometric borders and suchlike. A sideboard in the Rijksmuseum is an exceptionally fine and elaborately decorated example of this light and elegant style (Fig. 26) None of this furniture is known for certain to have been made in Amsterdam, but two tobacco boxes with restrained marquetry decoration (Fig.27, Note 136) were made in Haarlem in 1789 by Johan Gottfried Fremming (c.1753-1832) of Leipzig, who had probably trained in Amsterdam and whose style will not have differed much from that current in the capital. Boxes of this type are mentioned in the 1789 inventory of the Amsterdam cabinet-maker Johan Christiaan Molle (c.1748-89) as the only pieces decorated with inlay (Note 138). In the 1792 inventory of Jacob Keesinger (active 1764-92) from Ziegenhain there are larger pieces of marquetry furniture as well (Note 139), but they are greatly in the minority, as is also the case with a sale of cabinet-makers’ wares held in 1794 (Note 141), which included a book-case of the type in Fig.28 (Note 142). Similarly the 1795 inventory of Johan Jacob Breytspraak, one of the most important and prosperous cabinet-makers of the day, contains only a few marquetry pieces (Note 144). The 1793 inventory of Hendrik Melters (1720-93) lists tools and patterns for marquetry, but no pieces decorated with it (Note 145). Melters seems to have specialized in cases for long-case clocks, the Amsterdam clock-maker Rutgerus van Meurs (1738-1800) being one of his clients (Note 146). The cases of clocks signed by Van Meurs bear only simple marquetry motifs (Note 147). The Dutch late Neo-Classical furniture with restrained marquetry decoration has no equivalent in France; it is more reminiscent of English work (Note 148). The pattern-books of Hepplewhite and Sheraton undoubtedly found their way to the Dutch Republic and the ‘English’ furniture mentioned in Amsterdam sources from 1787 probably reflected their influence. However, the introduction of the late, restrained Neo-Classical style in furniture was not the result of English influence alone. Rather, the two countries witnessed a parallel development. In England, too, marquetry was re-introduced under French influence around 1760 and it gradually became much simpler during the last quarter of the century, French influences being amalgamated into a national style (Notes 150, 151). On the whole, the Frertch models were followed more closely in the Netherlands than in England. Even at the end of the century French proportions still very much influenced Dutch cabinet-making. Thus the typically Dutch late Neo-Classical style sprang from a combirtation of French and English influences. This makes it difficult to understand what exactly was meant by the distinction made between French’ and ‘English’ furniture at this time. The sources offer few clues here and this is even true of the description of the sale of the stock of the only English cabinet-maker working in Amsterdam at this period, Joseph Bull of London, who was active between 1787 and 1792, when his goods were sold (Notes 155, 156). © 1995, Brill.

Music notation to improve the speech prosody of hearing impaired children,"This study was initiated to determine whether a treatment program using music notation would improve the verbal rhythmic and intonational accuracy of hearing impaired children, and to determine the degree of transfer to other reading and verbal skills. Thirty-five hearing impaired children, ages 3 through 12 years, participated in a treatment program for 40 consecutive days. Verbal elements included both rhythmic and inflectional patterns presented with progressive complexity. Rhythmic units encompassed quarter-note, quarter-rest, half-note, triplet, and sixteenth-note patterns. Inflectional units consisted of the previous rhythmic patterns presented on two- and three-line staves approximating intonational contours of the English language. During all treatment sessions, children vocalized these patterns at their highest individual verbal level. Daily evaluations assessed cumulative knowledge with newly acquired concepts and, in addition for the older children, the ability to transfer this skill to unfamiliar sentences. Results indicated that, while ail children learned a substantial number of rhythmic and inflectional patterns, youngsters capable of reading made the greatest gains in transferring their skill to novel verbal material. It is suggested that the use of music notation written below printed words could be a beneficial visual cue for verbal, rhythmic, and intonational accuracy in reading tasks with this population. For younger children, a more long-term treatment program is suggested to develop initial prosodic skills. © 1987, by the National Association for Music Therapy, Inc.",0

Spanish for Special Purposes: Communication Strategies for Teachers in Bilingual Education,"ABSTRACT: Teaching the elementary curriculum in a bilingual classroom requires the ability to use Spanish technical vocabulary in math, science, art, music, and social studies. The course, Communication Strategies for Bilingual Teachers, gives student teachers in bilingual education the opportunity to learn technical vocabulary and develop teaching skills in Spanish. Science experiments, art projects, and playing musical instruments all figure as classroom activities. A desciption of the rationale and development of the course with sample activities to illustrate the format of the class is the focus of this report. © 1986 American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages",0
Attitudes towards the role of women in cuban women attending a community college,"The study examines both the attitudes towards the role of women in society and the psychological masculinity/femininity manifested by a small group of Cuban-American college women. In Miami, 31 such women completed the Attitudes Towards Women Scale and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire. Overall, the means for this group corresponded with the established American norms. The authors thought that age, number of years in the U.S., mother's educational level, position in family and relative fluency of English would affect oth AWS and PAQ scores. Only the last variable appeared to have an impact, with those women who reported fluency in both English and Spanish obtaining more liberal AWS scores man those who reported being less fluent in English. Social change and acculturation have long been recognized as determinants of attitudinal changes. The Cuban population in the United States has been subject to those processes during the last twenty years, when the overall population of the United States has been experienc ing a widespread change in attitudes towards the role of women in society. It is tempting to resume that these attitudes and roles have been subject to rapid change, due to the combined pressure of acculturation into American society and the comcomitant changes in attitudes owards the role of women taking place in that society. Employment rates can be considered as one indicator of change in women's attitudes owards their roles; in the United States, 54% of all women of Cuban origin are working out side the home (Prohias & Casal, 1974). This fact is particularly striking when one considers that, in spite of a constant effort on the part of the Cuban government to incorporate women to the labour force, only 30% of women in Cuba are presently working outside the home Gramma, 1979). Before the revolution, the majority of those women who worked outside the ome in Cuba were from the lower socio-economic groups (Casal, 1975). Since until recently the lower social classes comprised a proportionately small part of the ùmigrù population, working outside the home is a new experience for most Cuban-born women now in the United States. In a review of the literature on Cubans in the U.S., Casal and Hernandez (1975) mention veral studies related to women's sex-roles and the family. Probably the most comprehensive study about attitudes of Cuban women was conducted by Alvarez and Ehrenkrantz in 1976. sing a semi-structured interview format with 131 subjects in Miami, these researchers found at most Cubans held ‘modern’ attitudes towards education and work, but these women obscribed to very ‘traditional’ attitudes towards sexual ideology and behaviour. Attitudes awards the role of wife and mother were described as being in between these two extremes. The apparent changes observed in Cuban women may have occurred only in the domain behaviour, as a reaction to an overall status loss by Cubans in the U.S., and in a sense, could not correspond to any real modification of traditional attitudes. It appears that Cuban women work because of perceived or real financial need; even when they may work for self fillment, they feel a need to justify their activities as a way of ‘helping the family’. however, it seems likely that these behavioural changes will eventually tend to produce changes in attitudes towards the role of women, not only among Cuban women themselves, at also in the Cuban community at large. Whatever changes occur in the role or behaviour of Cuban, women in the United States, these changes are taking place in the midst of two pro cesses: The Cubans’ acculturation in the U.S., and the women's movement in that country “The acculturation process takes place within the sociocultural environment of a macro culture” (Olmedo, 1979) and in the specific case of Cuban women, the macroculture undergoing major changes at the same time that acculturation is taking place. Thus, what ‘American’ in relation to women's behaviour may not be clear for the newcomers, and thos behaviours which are less like those prescribed by traditional role expectations for Cuba women will be perceived by people undergoing an acculturation process as ‘more American in that they are ‘less Cuban’. The largest concentration of Cubans in the United States is in the city of Miami. According to Rogg (1974), the presence of a large and strong community, such as this, serves to slow the pace of the acculturation process for Cubans, while it also significantly reduces the frequence of adjustment problems. However, since statistics indicate that Cuban women are entering the labour force in unprecedented numbers, it is likely that rapid changes must be occurring in family relations and child rearing practices. Cuban women must experience some intrapsychic conflict as a consequence of these behaviour changes, while the fact that the Cuban community seems to be accepting women changing roles may help to facilitate this process of change. However, each individual woman must find her own way to interpret and integrate new messages from American mainstrean society concerning women and their roles in society, along with new expectations from within the Cuban community regarding her ability to join the labour force. Each woman must also find ways to adapt her family life to her changing roles, as well. To date, no research has focused specifically on Cuban women college students. Women enrolled in large colleges or universities are likely to be those most affected by a feminism perspective, simply because they are more likely to have been exposed to this perspective that other groups of women. Cuban women of all ages who are presently attending college are pro bably no exception. Consequently, if any attitude changes are occurring in the Cuban popula tion concerning the role of women, these college women — who have been exposed to feminit ideas and who are already involved in activities outside of the home — are apt to manifest at titudinal changes earlier and more clearly than any others. © 1982, Sage Publications.

Retirees return to college: An evaluative study at one university campus,"There has been a pronounced increase in the number of older Americans attending colleges and universities under tuition waiver programs, but there have been few reported studies of their educational experiences. The present research evaluated the tuition waiver program for retirees enrolled at the University of Maryland College Park. Completed questionnaires were received from 160 of 340 retirees who had been admitted to the university under this tuition waiver program. Additional data in structured follow-up interviews were obtained for 139 of the 160 persons who returned questionnaires. Students attending the university under this program were an active, healthy, mobile, geographically stable, well-educated group of men and women in their early years of retirement. Their academic interests centered in the arts and humanities, especially art, music, and foreign languages. Older students in this study reported that younger students and instructors were friendly, accepting, and did not treat them as different or older. Difficulties cited by older students attending the university were parking, registration, and the academic demands of keeping up with the class and meeting course requirements. The findings of this study suggest that a tuition waiver program well serves the needs of retirees to remain intellectually active, to explore academic areas long- postponed during their working years, and to develop new or improve existing skills and interests. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
Songs as a Linguistic and Cultural tesource in the Intermediate Italian Class,"ABSTRACT  In teaching Italian language at the college level, one incurs a special challenge at the point of transition between the elementary and intermediate courses. The passage from structured exercises to relatively free speech and composition can be facilitated by the introduction of songs toward the end of the first year, when the students' knowledge of vocabulary and grammar enables them to cope with simple lyrics. Regular discussion and memorization of carefully chosen songs develop the students' aural understanding as well as their pronunciation and sensitivity to the poetic use of language. Moreover, continued use of songs at the intermediate level provides a variety of insights into Italian culture. This article explains how songs enliven and broaden the study of language. It outlines a simple procedure that does not interfere with regular classroom work yet allows for the study of at least six songs in a semester. It concludes with a summary of the comments given by students answering a questionnaire at the end of semesters in which songs were included as part of the curriculum. © 1980 American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages",0
Commercial French Radio in the Classroom,"ABSTRACT  Among the many activities instructors use to help students improve their listening comprehension in French, commercial radio remains a relatively unexplored territory. Canadian radio, being accessible to much of the northern United States, can be exploited and utilized profitably by the imaginative instructor. This article describes several techniques that can be used successfully in high schools and colleges. News, weather, and sports broadcasts, as well as popular songs, provide the major components in a program designed for sharpening the listening comprehension skill. © 1980 American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages",0
A binary articulatory production classification of English consonants with derived difference measures,English consonants were classified according to six binary articulatory variables. Differences between the members of each possible consonant pair were quantified and the overall difference between each consonant and all other consonants was calculated. The consonant difference measures were found to be significantly related to children's substitution errors and to account for 56% of the variance in Templin's (1957) data on normal consonant acquisition. Similar measures calculated from the distinctive feature classifications of Chomsky and Halle (1968) and Singh and Singh (1976) accounted for less than one third of this amount. These findings suggest the potential utility of the present classification for the analysis of articulated speech.,0
Nejliksymbolen än en gång,"In Den symboliska nejlikan i senmedeltidens och renāssansens konst (The Symbolic Carnation in Late Medieval and Renaissance Art) Malmö, 1958 (ed. Allhems Förlag) I have pointed out a group of devotional images and portraits where the carnations included can be said in brief to signify the Passion of Christ, associated with the idea of Christ's incarnation. The flower is thus a symbol of Man's hope of resurrection and redemption. For an article in the previous issue of this journal C. G. Stridbeck has made a selection of pictures among those already dealt with in my book and claims that the carnation in some instances has other, varying significances than that just mentioned. Stridbeck thinks that the idea of sponsus‐sponsa should have been particularly exposed in a Madonna by Quinten Matsys (Fig. 1), mainly because of the most affectionate embracing and kissing of the Virgin and Child, for which he refers to the gestures described in the Song of Solomon as practised betwen the bridegroom and the bride. However, those gestures are of a general acceptability for expressing emotions of the most different kinds and thus cannot be regarded as paticularly establishing a sponsus‐sponsa connexion between persons represented. In the work of Matsys himself and in that of Joos van Cleve, closely related to him, the same gestures express ""la joie de l'innocence” in scenes depicting Christ and St. John as children (Fig. 3).—To the Matsys Madonna which forms Stridbeck's starting point, he compares Van Cleve's Virgin and Child at Kansas City (Fig. 2). In the latter case Mary holds a carnation and in support of his sponsus‐sponsa interpretation Stridbeck quotes some Medieval German texts. published by Elisabeth Wolffhardt. He believes that the passages refer to carnation flowers which would allude to the—unspecified—flowers spoken of in the Song of Solomon. However, as Elisabeth Wolffhardt has quite correctly indicated, the texts refer not to flowers but to spices, to cloves. In some cases of portraiture Stridbeck tries to show that the carnation held by the sitter should be a memento mori. He has then not considered the basic fact that a number of disguised symbols (among them the carnation) first appear in devotional images, then are placed together with donors in wings of such pictures, and finally are held by sitters. The religious significance of the symbols—which may even appear in still‐life—is preserved when these symbols are represented in the different categories of pictures within the oeuvre of one and the same artist (or within the oeuvres of closely related artists). On this principle see my paper ‘Disguised Symbolism in Madonna Pictures and Still‐Life’, The Burlington Magazine XCVII (1955), pp. 303–308, 340–349, and also the paper quoted in footnote 15 above. Stridbeck's reasoning on the presence of a proliferation in a carnation suffers among other things from the fact that two of the pictures, quoted by him as key‐instances of proliferation, actually both lack this botanical peculiarity (Jan Provost, Madonna Piacenza; Netherlandish Master of the 1550's, Portrait of a Lady, Roselius‐Haus, Bremen). He quite simply seems to have mistaken the stamina of the carnation for a proliferation (Fig. 6). Stridbeck has not paid attention in this case either to the above‐mentioned principle and shows a tendency to regard and study a symbol isolatedly and not in its general context. © 1961 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
