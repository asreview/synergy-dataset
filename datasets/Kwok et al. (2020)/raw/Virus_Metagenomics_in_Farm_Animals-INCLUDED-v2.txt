AB  - Porcine kobuviruses (PoKoVs) are ubiquitously distributed in pig populations worldwide and are thought to be enteric viruses in swine. Although PoKoVs have been detected in pigs in Japan, no complete genome data for Japanese PoKoVs are available. In the present study, 24 nearly complete or complete sequences of the PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheic feces and 14 non-diarrheic feces of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2–100% identity with the complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and the closest relationship of 85.1–98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a deletion of 90 nt in the 2B coding region. Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to their geographical region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, and P3 genetic regions showed topologies different from each other. Similarity plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different similarity patterns among strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV strains are prevalent and not restricted geographically on pig farms worldwide and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs.

AB  - An outbreak of enteric disease of unknown etiology with 60% morbidity and 8% mortality in weaning piglets occurred in November 2015 on a farm in Buryat Republic, Russia. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in feces from diseased piglets while no other pathogens were identified. Clinical disease was reproduced in experimentally infected piglets, yielding the 11 RVB gene segments for strain Buryat15, with an RVB genotype constellation of G12-P[4]-I13-R4-C4-M4-A8-N10-T4-E4-H7. This genotype constellation has also been identified in the United States. While the Buryat15 VP7 protein lacked unique amino acid differences in the predicted neutralizing epitopes compared to the previously published swine RVB G12 strains, this report of RVB in Russian swine increases our epidemiological knowledge on the global prevalence and genetic diversity of RVB.

AB  - Antibiotics are a cost-effective tool for improving feed efficiency and preventing disease in agricultural animals, but the full scope of their collateral effects is not understood. Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sul-famethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the "kill-the-winner" ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics. © 2011 Allen et al.

AB  - Pigs harbor a variety of viruses that are closely related to human viruses and are suspected to have zoonotic potential. Little is known about the presence of viruses in smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to the metagenomics analysis of viruses in feces collected from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. Blastx search results revealed that 1039 contigs (>200 nt) were related to viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa because they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian viruses resembling members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. This is the first report on the diversity of the fecal virome of pig populations in East Africa. The findings of the present study help to elucidate the etiology of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify potential zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region. Further investigations are required to compare the incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs in order to better elucidate their pathogenic role.

AB  - Congenital tremors is a sporadic disease of neonatal pigs characterized by action-related repetitive myoclonus. A majority of outbreaks of congenital tremors have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were to 1) detect potential pathogen(s) in samples from piglets with congenital tremors and 2) develop an infection model to reproduce disease. Using next-generation sequencing, a divergent lineage pestivirus was detected in piglets with congenital tremors. The virus was originally most closely related to a bat pestivirus but is now more closely related to a recently published novel porcine pestivirus provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus. A quantitative real-time PCR detected the virus in samples from neonatal piglets with congenital tremors from two separate farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To fulfill the second objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with either serum containing the pestivirus or PBS (control) by intravenous and intranasal routes simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic vesicles by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. Inoculations were performed at either 45 or 62 days of gestation. All sows inoculated with the novel pestivirus farrowed piglets affected with congenital tremors while PBS-inoculated control piglets were unaffected. Tremor severity for each piglet was scored from videos taken 0, 1 and 2 days post-farrowing. Tremor severity remained relatively constant from 0 to 2 days post-farrowing for a majority of piglets. The prevalence of congenital tremors in pestivirus-inoculated litters ranged from 57% (4 out of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 out of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors but was not detected in control piglets. Samples positive by PCR in greater than 90% of piglets sampled included brainstem (37 out of 41), mesenteric lymph node (37 out of 41), tracheobronchial lymph node (37 out of 41), and whole blood (19 out of 20). Although the first description of congenital tremors was in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremors following experimental inoculation with a divergent lineage porcine pestivirus. Studies investigating disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors due to this pestivirus.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to represent one of the most significant threats to human health. In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus Hepacivirus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly yielded a nearly full-length genome coding for a polyprotein of 2,779 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a novel species within the genus Hepacivirus. Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.

AB  - Papillomaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that are known to infect a wide range of animal species. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are divided into at least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21),  with most BPV isolates/strains described to date belonging to one of four genera, including Deltapapillomavirus, Xipapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus and Dyoxipapillomavirus. Here, we describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new BPV type in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in the state of New York, USA, reported chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab samples collected from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic investigation. Conventional diagnostic assays yielded negative results, and vaginal swab samples were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome with 7480 bp in length (67% nt sequence identity to BPV16). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene of the papillomavirus identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it clusters with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the recently identified BPV16, which was detected in fibropapilloma lesions in cattle also clusters within the Dyokappapapillomavirus group. Each virus, however, forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. These results indicate that the putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus.

AB  - Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play an important role in balancing microbes within an ecosystem and facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (~78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to be the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed the possibility to investigate and characterise the entire microbiome of individuals, providing better insight to the complex interaction between different microorganisms. This will help to understand how the microbiome influence the susceptibility of secondary agents and development of disease. We have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as from healthy pigs. The aim is to increase knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these types of viruses will help to better understand the role that these ubiquitous viruses may have on health and disease of pigs. We also demonstrate for the first time, in Europe, the presence of a novel porcine pestivirus.

AB  - Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.

AB  - Members of the family Picornaviridae are important pathogens of humans and animals, although compared with the thousands of known bird species (>10 000), only a few (n = 11) picornaviruses have been identified from avian sources. This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two of three) and affected (seven of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven (88 %) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank accession no. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96 %) to the partial P3 genome region of a picornavirus reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long 'barbell-like' structure found at the 3′ UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera Avihepatovirus and Kobuvirus. The general presence of turkey picornavirus - a novel picornavirus species - in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms. Further studies are needed to investigate the aetiological role and pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in food animals. © 2012 SGM.

AB  - This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples of healthy (1/3) and affected (6/8) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome in Hungary. The virus was detected at seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically different from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), and showed distant phylogenetic relationship and common genomic features (e.g. uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A polypeptides) to duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) of the genus Avihepatovirus. The complete genome analysis revealed multiple distinct genome features like the presence of two in-tandem aphthovirus 2A-like sequence repeats with DxExNPG/P 'ribosomeskipping' sites (76 %, 23/30 amino acids identical), with the first aphthovirus 2A-like sequence being located at the end of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1/2A1 'ribosome-skipping' site). The phylogenetic analyses, low sequence identity (33, 32 and 36% amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions) to DHAV, and the type II-like internal ribosome entry site suggests that this turkey picornavirus is related to, but distinct from the genus Avihepatovirus and it could be the founding member of a novel Avihepatovirus sister-clade genus. This is the third, taxonomically highly distinct picornavirus clade identified from turkeys exhibiting varied symptoms. © 2013 SGM.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Members of the family Picornaviridae consist of small positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses capable of infecting various vertebrate species, including birds. One of the recently identified avian picornaviruses, with a remarkably long (>9,040-nucleotide) but still incompletely sequenced genome, is turkey hepatitis virus 1 (THV-1; species Melegrivirus A, genus Megrivirus), a virus associated with liver necrosis and enteritis in commercial turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). This report presents the results of the genetic analysis of three complete genomes of megriviruses from fecal samples of chickens (chicken/B21-CHV/2012/HUN, GenBank accession no. KF961186, and chicken/CHK-IV-CHV/2013/HUN, GenBank accession no. KF961187) (Gallus gallus domesticus) and turkey (turkey/B407-THV/2011/HUN, GenBank accession no. KF961188) (Meleagris gallopavo) with the largest picornavirus genome (up to 9,739 nucleotides) so far described. The close phylogenetic relationship to THV-1 in the nonstructural protein-coding genome region and possession of the same internal ribosomal entry site type (IVB-like) suggest that the study strains belong to the genus Megrivirus. However, the genome comparisons revealed numerous unique variations (e.g., different numbers of potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3' genome parts with various lengths of a potential second open reading frame, and multiple repeating sequence motifs in the 3' untranslated region) and heterogeneous sequence relationships between the structural and nonstructural genome regions. These differences suggest the classification of chicken megrivirus-like viruses into a candidate novel species in the genus Megrivirus. Based on the different phylogenetic positions of chicken megrivirus-like viruses at the structural and nonstructural genome regions, the recombinant nature of these viruses is plausible. IMPORTANCE: The comparative genome analysis of turkey and novel chicken megriviruses revealed numerous unique genome features, e.g., up to four potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3' genome parts with various lengths containing a potential second open reading frame, multiple repeating sequence motifs, and heterogeneous sequence relationships (possibly due to a recombination event) between the structural and nonstructural genome regions. Our results could help us to better understand the evolution and diversity (in terms of sequence and genome layout) of picornaviruses.

AB  - Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) of family Picobirnaviridae have bisegmented (S1 and S2 segments), double-stranded RNA genomes. In this study a total of N = 12 complete chicken PBVs (ChPBV) segments (N = 5 of S1 and N = 7 of S2, Acc. Nos.: MH425579-90) were determined using viral metagenomic and RT-PCR techniques from a single cloacal sample of a diarrheic chicken. The identified ChPBV segments are unrelated to each other and distant from all of the currently known PBVs. In silico sequence analyses revealed the presence of conserved prokaryotic Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequences upstream of the three presumed open reading frames (ORFs) of the S1 and a single presumed ORF of the S2 segments. According to the results of expression analyses in E. coli using 6xHis-tagged recombinant ChPBV segment 1 construct and Western blot these SD-like sequences are functional in vivo suggesting that S1 of study PBVs can contain three ORFs and supporting the bacteriophage-nature of PBVs.

AB  - Novel types of astrovirus have been identified recently in association with neurological disease in cattle. Among those viruses is bovine astrovirus CH13 (BoAstV CH13) that has been identified in Switzerland in a cow with encephalitis. Molecular testing by a combination of reverse transcription (RT-) PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) indicated that astrovirus infection accounts for around one quarter of viral encephalitis cases of unknown etiology in cattle. Yet, it remained to be explored whether these animals were infected by BoAstV CH13 or other astrovirus species. In the present study we sequenced the entire astrovirus genome in brain tissues of eight RT-PCR and/or ISH positive cattle. Phylogenetic comparison of the genomic RNA and the encoded non-structural and structural proteins revealed that all these astrovirus strains were very similar to BoAstV CH13 as well as to a bovine encephalitis strain reported from the USA (BoAstV NeuroS1), and clearly distinct from other previously reported astroviruses. Conserved 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were predicted to display distinct secondary RNA structures, which likely play a role in viral RNA replication and/or protein translation. Based on these data we propose that BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 represents a new genotype species within the genus Mammastrovirus. The high degree of similarity between the strains and their relative distance to other genotype species suggest that during evolution some astroviruses acquired factors that specifically contribute to neuroinvasion.

AB  - Encephalitis is a frequently diagnosed condition in cattle with neurological diseases. Many affected animals present with a non-suppurative inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Additionally, BoAstV RNA was detected with reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in about one fourth (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses.

AB  - Rotavirus B (RVB) has been associated with enteric disease in many animal species. An RVB strain was identified in pooled intestinal samples from Alpine caprine kids (between 2 and 3 days of age) experiencing high (>90%) morbidity, and the complete caprine RVB genome was characterized. Histology revealed villus atrophy, the samples tested positive for RVB by real-time RT-PCR and metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified only RVB and orf virus. In the VP4 gene segment, the caprine RVB strain had a higher percentage nucleotide identity to the Indian bovine RVB strains than to the Japanese bovine RVB strains, but the VP7, VP6, VP2, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP5 gene segments of the American caprine RVB strain were genetically related to the Japanese bovine RVB strains. The results indicate a lack of RVB sequences to understand reassortment or the evolutionary relationship of RVB strains from cattle and goats.

AB  - The rapid discovery of novel viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our understanding of viral diversity in recent years. The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs. © 2013 Chen et al.

AB  - Background: Emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in North America, Asia and Europe has caused severe economic loss to the global swine industry. However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. Methods: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. Results: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.

AB  - The yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4-66.2% similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that one possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2. In summary, this study expanded our understanding of the viral communities of diarrhoeal yaks and identified a novel AstV that was associated with diarrhoea in yaks.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases in swine caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Genome sequences of sixty-six PRRSV strains were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the U.S. in 2014 to explore contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct lineages with > 87% intraclade identity. To explore the effect of the observed genetic diversity on antigenicity, the genome regions encoding either GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of eight distinct PRRSV strains using reverse genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region from only four of the eight strains yielded viable recombinant virus. When viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A strain-dependent significant loss in cross reactivity was variably observed by indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with commercial modified-live vaccines following replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using antisera from naturally PRRSV-exposed pigs. These results illustrate the need to consider genomic regions besides GP5 for PRRSV epidemiology and vaccination.

AB  - Using metagenomics and molecular cloning methods, we characterized five novel small, circular viral genomes from pig feces that are distantly related to chimpanzee and porcine stool-associated circular viruses, (ChiSCV and PoSCV1). Phylogenetic analysis placed these viruses into a highly divergent clade of this rapidly growing new viral family. This new clade of viruses, provisionally named porcine stool-associated circular virus 2 and 3 (PoSCV2 and PoSCV3), encodes a stem-loop structure (presumably the origin of DNA replication) in the small intergenic region and a replication initiator protein commonly found in other biological systems that replicate their genomes via the rolling-circle mechanism. Furthermore, these viruses also exhibit three additional overlapping open reading frames in the large intergenic region between the capsid and replication initiator protein genes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien (outside the USA).

AB  - A novel bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) genotype comprising 5394 nt was identified by next generation sequencing from sera of healthy cattle at different age groups farmed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The genome organization of new BPV2 genotype retains the two ORFs typical of members of the Parvovirinae with 86.4 % of overall nucleotide sequence identities in comparison to other members of the subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similar clustering with two previously described bovine BPV2 within the genus Copiparvovirus. No significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) were detected in the distribution of BPV2 infection in cattle at different age groups. This is the third complete or near complete genome sequence of BPV2 reported to date and may contribute to a better understanding of the biology of copiparvoviruses and its interactions with the host.

AB  - Diarrhea outbreaks in pig farms have raised major concerns in Europe and USA, as they can lead to dramatic pig losses. During a suspected outbreak in Belgium of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), we performed viral metagenomics to assess other potential viral pathogens. Although PEDV was detected, its low abundance indicated that other viruses were involved in the outbreak. Interestingly, a porcine bocavirus and several enteroviruses were most abundant in the sample. We also observed the presence of a porcine enterovirus genome with a gene insertion, resembling a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed using re-sequencing, bioinformatics, and proteomics approaches. Moreover, the predicted cleavage sites for the insertion suggest that this gene was being expressed as a single protein, rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported as a major mechanism to generate genetic diversity, but gene insertions across viral families are rather uncommon. Although such inter-family recombinations are rare, our finding suggests that these events may significantly contribute to viral evolution.

AB  - Viral enteric disease is an ongoing economic burden to poultry producers worldwide, and despite considerable research, no single virus has emerged as a likely causative agent and target for prevention and control efforts. Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, with many small, round viruses eluding classification based solely on morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We utilized the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis of this turkey gut RNA metagenome focuses in particular on the turkey-origin members of the Picornavirales, the Caliciviridae, and the turkey Picobirnaviruses. © 2010 Dayet al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Previous research into the viral community in the poultry gastrointestinal tract has revealed a number of novel and partially described enteric viruses. It is evident that the poultry gut viral community remains minimally characterized and incompletely understood. Investigations into the microbiome of the poultry gut have provided some insight into the geographical distribution and the rapidly evolving taxonomy of the avian enteric picornaviruses. The present investigation was undertaken to produce a comparative metagenomic analysis of the gut virome from a healthy turkey flock versus a flock placed in the field. This investigation revealed a number of enteric picornavirus sequences that were present in the commercial birds in the field that were completely absent in the healthy flock. A novel molecular diagnostic assay was used to track the shedding of field strains of turkey enteric picornavirus in commercial poults inoculated with picornavirus-positive intestinal homogenates prepared from turkeys that were experiencing moderate enteric disease. The propagation of this novel enteric picornavirus in commercial poults resulted in significant reduction in weight gain, and suggests that this common inhabitant of the turkey gut may result in performance problems or enteric disease in the field.

AB  - Parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Many parvoviral pathogens of medical, veterinary and ecological importance have been identified. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds and cattle in Pernambuco, São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul states. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches and were thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been described previously), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus). Moreover, our investigation provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, revealing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sub-lineages that circulate widely throughout the world within particular taxonomic groups of hosts.

AB  - Recent studies show that human skin at homeostasis is a complex ecosystem whose virome include circular DNA viruses, especially papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses. To determine the chicken skin virome in comparison with human skin virome, a chicken swabs pool sample from fifteen indoor healthy chickens of five genetic backgrounds was examined for the presence of DNA viruses by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The results indicate a predominance of herpesviruses from the Mardivirus genus, coming from either vaccinal origin or presumably asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS method used herein to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, or circoviruses, indicating that these viruses may not be resident of the chicken skin. The results suggest that the turkey herpesvirus is a resident of chicken skin in vaccinated chickens. This study indicates major differences between the skin viromes of chickens and humans. The origin of this difference remains to be further studied in relation with skin physiology, environment, or virus population dynamics.

AB  - Runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in broiler chickens is an enteric disease that causes significant economic losses to poultry producers worldwide due to elevated feed conversion ratios, decreased body weight during growth, and excessive culling. Of specific interest are the viral agents associated with RSS which have been difficult to fully characterize to date. Past research into the aetiology of RSS has implicated a wide variety of RNA and DNA viruses however, to date, no individual virus has been identified as the main agent of RSS and the current opinion is that it may be caused by a community of viruses, collectively known as the virome. This paper attempts to characterize the viral pathogens associated with 2-3-week-old RSS-affected and unaffected broiler chickens using next-generation sequencing and comparative metagenomics. Analysis of the viromes identified a total of 20 DNA and RNA viral families, along with 2 unidentified categories, comprised of 31 distinct viral genera and 7 unclassified genera. The most abundant viral families identified in this study were the Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Coronaviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae. This study has identified historically significant viruses associated with the disease such as chicken astrovirus, avian nephritis virus, chicken parvovirus, and chicken calicivirus along with relatively novel viruses such as chicken megrivirus and sicinivirus 1 and will help expand the knowledge related to enteric disease in broiler chickens, provide insights into the viral constituents of a healthy avian gut, and identify a variety of enteric viruses and viral communities appropriate for further study.

AB  - Heparin is one of the main pharmaceutical products manufactured from raw animal material. In order to describe the viral burden associated with this raw material, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on mucus samples destined for heparin manufacturing, which were collected from European pigs. We identified Circoviridae and Parvoviridae members as the most prevalent contaminating viruses, together with viruses from the Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, and Anelloviridae families. Putative new viral species were also identified. The load of several known or novel small non-enveloped viruses, which are particularly difficult to inactivate or eliminate during heparin processing, was quantified by qPCR. Analysis of the combined HTS and specific qPCR results will influence the refining and validation of inactivation procedures, as well as aiding in risk analysis of viral heparin contamination.

AB  - Vampire bats are the only mammals known to feed exclusively on blood from other animals, often from domestic cattle. We tested the hypothesis that the adaptation of vampire bats to hematophagy would have resulted in shared viral communities among vampire bats and cattle, as a direct result of historic spillover events occurring due to hematophagy. We analyzed the presence of different viruses in sample populations of sympatric bat and prey populations and searched for shared viruses between taxa. A limited number of DNA viral groups were detected within each species. However, there was no evidence for a shared viral community among the vampire bat and cattle populations tested.

AB  - BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes an acute hemorrhagic infection in suids with a mortality rate of up to 100%. No vaccine is available and the potential for catastrophic disease in Europe remains elevated due to the ongoing ASF epidemic in Russia and Baltic countries. To date, intra-epidemic whole-genome variation for ASFV has not been reported. To provide a more comprehensive baseline for genetic variation early in the ASF outbreak, we sequenced two Georgian ASFV samples, G-2008/1 and G-2008/2, derived from domestic porcine blood collected in 2008. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted directly from low-volume ASFV PCR-positive porcine blood samples and subjected to next generation sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform. De novo and mapped sequence assemblies were performed using CLCBio software. Genomic illustrations, sequence alignments and assembly figures were generated using Geneious v10.2.4. Sequence repeat architecture was analyzed using DNASTAR GeneQuest 14.1.0. RESULTS: The G-2008/1 and G-2008/2 genomes were distinguished from each other by coding changes in seven genes, including MGF 110-1 L, X69R, MGF 505-10R, EP364R, H233R, E199L, and MGF 360-21R in addition to eight homopolymer tract variations. The 2008/2 genome possessed a novel allele state at a previously undescribed intergenic repeat locus between genes C315R and C147L. The C315R/C147L locus represents the earliest observed variable repeat sequence polymorphism reported among isolates from this epidemic. No sequence variation was observed in conventional ASFV subtyping markers. The two genomes exhibited complete collinearity and identical gene content with the Georgia 2007/1 reference genome. Approximately 56 unique homopolymer A/T-tract variations were identified that were unique to the Georgia 2007/1 genome. In both 2008 genomes, within-sample sequence read heterogeneity was evident at six homopolymeric G/C-tracts confined to the known hypervariable ~ 7 kb region in the left terminal region of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first intra-epidemic comparative genomic analysis reported for ASFV and provides insight into the intra-epidemic microevolution of ASFV. The genomes reported here, in addition to the G-2007/1 genome, provide an early baseline for future genome-level comparisons and epidemiological tracing efforts.

AB  - Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens detected in fecal samples of both diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves from several countries worldwide. However, epidemiological information regarding bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle producing countries from South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third one (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) together with the presence of another sequence (B4881) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1, but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). According to this data, this strain could be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is widespread in the global pig population. Although clinically inapparent in pigs, HEV infection is the cause of Hepatitis E in humans and transmission via the food chain has been established. Following a 2013 study that investigated prevalence of HEV infection in UK slaughter-age pigs samples indicating highest viral load were selected for further characterisation. High throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete coding sequence from five samples. An in-frame insertion was observed within the HEV hypervariable region in two samples. To interrogate whether this mutation may be the cause of high-level viraemia and faecal shedding as observed in the sampled pigs virus isolation and culture was conducted. Based on viral growth kinetics there was no evidence that these insertions affected replication efficiency in vitro, suggesting as yet undetermined host factors may affect the course of infection and consequently the risk of foodborne transmission.

AB  - In this study, a novel circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single stranded (CRESS) DNA virus was discovered in diarrheic sample of a calf with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. The virus, named Bo-Circo-like virus CH, has a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circo-like virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in bovine. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between the virus infection and diarrhea.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine caused by the eponymous virus (PEDV) which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains. In detail, three pasivirus A strains, two astroviruses, a porcine sapelovirus, a kobuvirus, a porcine torovirus, a posavirus, and an enterobacteria phage were almost fully sequenced.

AB  - In this study, a novel parvovirus (strain swine/Zsana3/2013/HUN, KT965075) was detected in domestic pigs and genetically characterized by viral metagenomics and PCR methods. The novel parvovirus was distantly related to the human bufaviruses and was detected in 19 (90.5 %) of the 21 and five (33.3 %) of the 15 faecal samples collected from animals with and without cases of posterior paraplegia of unknown etiology from five affected farms and one control farm in Hungary, respectively. Swine/Zsana3/2013/HUN is highly prevalent in domestic pigs and potentially represents a novel parvovirus species in the subfamily Parvovirinae.

AB  - Advances in DNA sequencing have increased our ability to generate large amounts of sequence data at lower costs. These developments have enabled microbial detection and characterization directly from clinical specimens, known as metagenomic sequencing. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed on five nasal-and five fecal-swab pools collected from each of two primary and two secondary market slaughterhouses and a cull-swine buying station in the southeastern United States. Sequences were assembled de novo and analyzed by BLASTN to identify viruses present in the samples. Twenty seven different viruses were identified. Reads similar to a diverse family of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified in nearly every sample (47 of 50). Other viruses identified at all five sampling sites and in over half of the samples were bocavirus, torovirus, posavirus, torque teno virus, IAS virus, picobirnavirus, and teschovirus. Viruses identified in multiple sites in greater than 20% of the samples included enterovirus, parvovirus, influenza A virus, sapelovirus, and Senecavirus A. Other significant swine viruses detected less frequently include porcine circovirus type 2, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus. Together, these results suggest that metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for virus detection and characterization.

AB  - Bovine rhinitis viruses (BRV) are established etiological agents of bovine respiratory disease complex however little research into their epidemiology and ecology has been published for several decades. In the U.S., only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were previously only identified in England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5'-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from diverse locations.

AB  - Pestiviruses are some of the most significant pathogens affecting ruminants and swine, Here, we assembled a 11 276 bp contig encoding a predicted 3635 aa polyprotein from porcine serum with 68 % pairwise identity to that of a recently partially characterized Rhinolophus affinis pestivirus (RaPV) and approximately 25–28 % pairwise identity to those of other pestiviruses, The virus was provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), Metagenomic sequencing of 182 serum samples identified four additional APPV-positive samples, Positive samples originated from five states and ELISAs using recombinant APPV Erns found cross-reactive antibodies in 94% of a collection of porcine serum samples, suggesting widespread distribution of APPV in the US swine herd, The molecular and serological results suggest that APPV is a novel, highly divergent porcine pestivirus widely distributed in US pigs.

AB  - De novo assembly of metagenomic sequencing reads from feces from a clinically normal pig identified two approximately 9 kb contigs which each consisted of a single large open reading frame. While one contig encoded a predicted 2990 amino acid protein with 83 % identity to the recently described posavirus 1, the other contig encoded a predicted 2942 amino acid protein with only 25 % identity limited to the genomic region encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of posavirus 2. Besides RdRp, search of the conserved domain database identified domains associated with picornavirus capsid proteins but failed to identify picornaviral helicase and proteinase domains. In addition, a domain representing a family of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma immunoglobulin-blocking virulence proteins was identified near the 5′-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis found a distant relationship between this novel virus, provisionally named posavirus 3, to the unclassified posaviruses and fisavirus which are proposed to represent different genera in a novel family of the Picornavirales.

AB  - Feral swine are known reservoirs for various pathogens that can adversely affect domestic animals. To assess the viral ecology of feral swine in the USA, metagenomic sequencing was performed on 100 pooled nasal swabs. The virome was dominated by small, ssDNA viruses belonging to the families Circoviridae, Anelloviridae and Parvovirinae. Only four RNA viruses were identified: porcine kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus and a novel Orthopneumovirus, provisionally named swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared ~90% nucleotide identity to murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine pneumovirus. A modified, commercially available ELISA for MPV found that approximately 30% of both feral and domestic swine sera were positive for antibodies cross-reactive with MPV. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR identified two (2 %) and four (5.0 %) positive nasal swab pools from feral and domestic swine, respectively, confirming that SOV circulates in both herds.

AB  - Bovine rotavirus B (RVB) is an etiological agent of diarrhea mostly in adult cattle. Currently, a few sequences of viral protein (VP)1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and nonstructural protein (NSP)1, 2, and 5 of bovine RVB are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases, and none have been reported for VP3, NSP3, and NSP4. In order to fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB strains, we used a metagenomics approach and sequenced and analyzed the complete coding sequences (CDS) of VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes, as well as the partial or complete CDS of other genes of RVBs detected from Japanese cattle. VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 of bovine RVBs shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3–64.9% for VP3, 65.9–68.2% for NSP3, and 52.6–56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine, human, and porcine RVBs, suggesting that bovine RVBs belong to a novel genotype. Furthermore, significantly low amino acid sequence identities were observed for NSP4 (36.1–39.3%) between bovine RVBs and the RVBs of other species. In contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those of RVBs of other species and rotavirus A (RVA) strains. Phylogenetic analyses of all gene segments revealed that bovine RVB strains formed a cluster that branched distantly from other RVBs. These results suggest that bovine RVBs have evolved independently from other RVBs but in a similar manner to other rotaviruses. These findings provide insights into the evolution and diversity of RVB strains.

AB  - Porcine astroviruses (PoAstVs) are ubiquitous enteric virus of pigs that are distributed in several countries throughout the world. Since PoAstVs are detected in apparent healthy pigs, the clinical significance of infection is unknown. However, AstVs have recently been associated with a severe neurological disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of nearly complete genomes of 36 PoAstVs detected by a metagenomics approach in the feces of Japanese pigs. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was found in individual fecal samples from eight pigs. The phylogenetic trees of ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their topologies. The PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 strain showed considerable sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence of multiple possible intra-genotype recombination events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have contributed to the genetic diversity and played an important role in the evolution of Japanese PoAstVs.

AB  - Neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology has been reported from a number of European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth, indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection.

AB  - Transmissible viral proventriculitis (TVP), an infectious disease in chickens, is responsible for economic losses in the commercial poultry industry. The major etiologic agent, however, is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the diversity of viruses present in proventriculus samples from flocks diagnosed with TVP to those of healthy flocks in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads generated by high-throughput sequencing, with a mean length of 160 nt. Enrichment in viral sequences suggested that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although we could not determine a pathogen of TVP that matched the known morphology, picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an association with TVP. The five samples yielded 1,045-1,720 bp contigs with 81-84 % nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). Whole-genome analysis indicated that the QIA01 strain of the novel picornavirus was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7 % nt and 95.5 % aa sequence identity), but different in the structural region and partial 2A peptides (56.2 % nt and 23.9 % aa sequence identity). In addition, the QIA01 virus was similar (87.0 % nt and 95.6 % aa sequence identity) to chicken megrivirus, recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in Hungary. Our results are useful for understanding the genetic diversity of avian picornaviruses and for classifying chicken megrivirus as a pathogen affecting the digestive tract of chickens.

AB  - Identification of unknown pathogens in pigs displaying enteric illness is difficult due to the large diversity of bacterial and viral species found within faecal samples. Current methods often require bacterial or viral isolation, or testing only a limited number of known species using quantitative PCR analysis. Herein, faeces from two 25-day-old piglets with diarrhoea from Texas, USA, were analysed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing to rapidly identify possible pathogens. Our analysis included a bioinformatics pipeline of rapid short-read classification and de novo genome assembly which resulted in the identification of a porcine enterovirus G (EV-G), a complete genome with substantial nucleotide differences (>30 %) among current sequences, and a novel non-structural protein similar in sequence to the Torovirus papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro). This discovery led to the identification and circulation of an EV-G with a novel PLpro in the USA that has not been previously reported.

AB  - Sapoviruses (SaV) are enteric viruses infecting humans and animals. SaVs are highly diverse and are divided into multiple genogroups based on structural protein (VP1) sequences. SaVs detected from pigs belong to eight genogroups (GIII, GV, GVI, GVII, GVIII, GIX, GX, and GXI), but little is known about the SaV genogroup distribution in the Japanese pig population. In the present study, 26 nearly complete genome (> 6000 nucleotide: nt) and three partial sequences (2429 nt, 4364 nt, and 4419 nt in length, including the entire VP1 coding region) of SaV were obtained from one diarrheic and 15 non-diarrheic porcine feces in Japan via a metagenomics approach. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 amino acid sequence (aa) revealed that 29 porcine SaVs were classified into seven genogroups; GIII (11 strains), GV (1 strain), GVI (3 strains), GVII (6 strains), GVIII (1 strain), GX (3 strains), and GXI (4 strains). This manuscript presents the first nearly complete genome sequences of GX and GXI, and demonstrates novel intergenogroup recombination events.

AB  - Although advances in nucleic acid sequencing have enabled the discovery of many infectious agents, challenges remain for scientists and veterinary diagnosticians trying to design animal studies with a minimum of variables and to interpret laboratory results. To evaluate pyrosequencing technology as a potential screening method to estimate the virome in pigs, fecal samples were collected from 4 pigs out of a group of 175 that had been raised together since birth. A number of viruses were detected, demonstrating the application of this technology to determine the background "noise" in the pigs. However, pyrosequencing also demonstrated the diversity of viruses within a group of animals and how that can confound experimental design and obscure a definitive diagnosis. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Sapoviruses (SaVs), belonging to the genus Sapovirus of the family Caliciviridae, were known as the enteric pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis. SaVs have been detected in humans and several animals including pigs and some porcine SaVs showed close sequence relationship with human strains suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission. Here, we sequenced the genomes of two porcine SaVs (with strain names of p38 and SH1703) using the metagenomic analyses and traditional RT-PCR methods. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the complete genome, the full-length VP 1 nucleotide and amino acid sequences to group those two strains. The two porcine SaV strains, p38 and SH1703, detected in this study, were classified as genogroup III and genogroup VII, respectively. These two strains showed similar genomic organization with that of other SaVs. We firstly divided SaVs into 51 genotypes within 19 genogroups. Our data are helpful for genetic characterization and classification of newly detected SaVs worldwide.

AB  - Using viral metagenomics of brain tissue from a young adult crossbreed steer with acute onset of neurologic disease, we sequenced the complete genome of a novel astrovirus (BoAstV-NeuroS1) that was phylogenetically related to an ovine astrovirus. In a retrospective analysis of 32 cases of bovine encephalitides of unknown etiology, 3 other infected animals were detected by using PCR and in situ hybridization for viral RNA. Viral RNA was restricted to the nervous system and detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons within the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions were of widespread neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing preferentially distributed in gray matter and most severe in the cerebellum and brainstem, with increasing intensity caudally down the spinal cord. These results suggest that infection with BoAstV-NeuroS1 is a potential cause of neurologic disease in cattle.

AB  - This study is focused on the identification of the faecal virome of healthy chickens raised in high-density, export-driven poultry farms in Brazil. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 7743 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with known nucleotide/amino acid sequences from the GenBank database. Analyses with BLASTx revealed that 279 contigs (4%) were related to sequences of eukaryotic viruses. Viral genome sequences (total or partial) indicative of members of recognized viral families, including Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, were identified, some of those representing novel genotypes. In addition, a range of circular replication-associated protein encoding DNA viruses were also identified. The characterization of the faecal virome of healthy chickens described here not only provides a description of the viruses encountered in such niche but should also represent a baseline for future studies comparing viral populations in healthy and diseased chicken flocks. Moreover, it may also be relevant for human health, since chickens represent a significant proportion of the animal protein consumed worldwide.

AB  - Malabsorption syndrome (MAS) is an economically important disease of young, commercially reared broilers, characterized by growth retardation, defective feather development and diarrheic faeces. Several viruses have been tentatively associated to such syndrome. Here, in order to examine potential associations between enteric viruses and MAS, the faecal viromes of 70 stool samples collected from diseased (n = 35) and healthy (n = 35) chickens from seven flocks were characterized and compared. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 8,347,319 paired end reads, with an average of 231 nt, were generated. Through analysis of de novo assembled contigs, 144 contigs > 1000 nt were identified with hits to eukaryotic viral sequences, as determined by GenBank database. A number of known and unknown representatives of Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, as well as novel uncharacterized CRESS-DNA viruses, were identified. However, the distribution of sequence reads of viral genomes identified in diseased or healthy birds revealed no statistically significant differences. These findings indicate no association between the occurrence of MAS and enteric viruses. The viral genomes reported in the present study, including a variety of novel viruses, seem part of the normal intestinal microbiota of chickens.

AB  - The virome in genital tract secretion samples collected from 80 dairy cattle in Shanghai, China, was characterized. Viruses detected included members of the families Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Hepeviridae, Parvoviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, and Picobirnaviridae. A member of a new species within the genus Dyoxipapillomavirus and six circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (CRESS-DNA) viral genomes were fully sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The prevalence of bovine polyomaviruses 1 and 2 was measured by PCR to be 10% (8/80) and 6.25% (5/80), respectively. PCR screening also indicated that the novel papillomavirus ujs-21015 and bovine herpesvirus 6 were present in three and two out of the 80 samples, respectively.

AB  - Bufavirus is a single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Protoparvovirus. This study reports the identification and characterization of a porcine bufavirus by a metagenomic approach, and a limited epidemiology investigation of bufavirus in six swine farms. A comparative genome analysis showed a similarity of 93% to a Hungarian porcine bufavirus. Bayesian and maximumlikelihood analyses of genome sequences showed a close relationship of porcine bufaviruses to human and monkey bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common ancestors supported a recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and pig populations, respectively. A real-time PCR method was developed to screen 60 faecal samples for the porcine bufavirus DNA, and eight positive samples were found in two neighbouring farms, suggesting a relatively low prevalence (13.3 %). No direct transmission of porcine bufaviruses between two neighbouring farms was found, suggesting that bufaviruses may have spread widely in different geographical regions.

AB  - Background: Orf or contagious ecthyma is a zoonotic viral infection with a potential serious health threat for the small ruminants industry as well as humans. It is currently emerging in new territories. Results: Eight suspected clinical cases of pustular dermatitis in goats occurred in the rural area of Tebe, in southeastern Gabon, in January 2013. The orf virus (ORFV) was detected by high-throughput sequencing on sera, buccal swabs and scab pool samples. It was confirmed in six out of eight sick goats by using specific PCR targeting the major envelope protein (B2L) and the orf virus interferon resistance (VIR) genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Gabonese strain and South Korean strains evolved from a common ancestor, suggesting an Asian origin of the ORFV' Gabonese strain. Conclusions: This study provides the molecular detection of the ORFV strain involved in the cases of pustular dermatitis in goats and highlights its circulation in Gabon.

AB  - Background: The rising demand for pork has resulted in a massive expansion of pig production in Uganda. This has resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Findings. Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. Conclusions: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact. © 2012 Masembe et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - There are few reports describing diarrhea of adult cattle caused by group A rotaviruses. Here, we report the identification of a novel bovine group A rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected from an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decrease in milk production in Japan in 2013. The comprehensive genomic analyses from fecal samples by viral metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an unreported genotype combination G15P[14]. The genome constellation of this strain, namely, RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14] was G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 representing VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Each gene segment of Tottori-SG was most closely related to Japanese bovine group A rotaviruses suggesting that Tottori-SG might have derived from multiple reassortment events from group A rotavirus strains circulating among Japanese cattle. No other diarrhea pathogen of adult cattle was detected by routine diagnosis and metagenomics. Viral metagenomics, using a next-generation sequencer, is useful to characterize group A rotaviruses from fecal samples and offers unbiased comprehensive investigations of pathogen. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel virus related to the Enterovirus/Sapelovirus supergroup in the family Picornaviridae was identified in healthy porcine feces in Japan by using a metagenomics approach. The genome of the virus, named Sapelo-like porcine picornavirus Japan (SPPVJ) Pig/Isi-Im1/JPN/2016, had a type-IV internal ribosomal entry site and carried a 6978-nucleotide-long single open reading frame encoding a 2326 amino acids (aa) polyprotein precursor. The coding sequence region consisted of leader protein (68 aa), a structural protein region P1 (824 aa), and the non-structural protein regions P2 (672 aa) and P3 (762 aa). Among representative picornaviruses, the P1, 2C, and 3CD regions of SPPVJ had the highest aa identities of 64.4%, 61.9%, and 73.3%, respectively, with the corresponding regions of sapelo-like bat picornavirus BtVs-PicoV/SC2013. Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from the 5’ untranslated and 3D regions revealed the presence of SPPVJ in 17.8% (19/107) of the feces from healthy and diarrheal pigs in 12 farms in 2015–2016. Further studies are needed to determine the origin and pathogenic potential of SPPJV in pigs and other mammals.

AB  - The influenza D virus, a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is predominantly found in cattle. Although viral pathology and clinical disease in cattle appear mild, this virus plays an important role as a trigger of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a costly illness worldwide. Thus, epidemiological surveys of the influenza D virus are necessary. Here, we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey for the influenza D virus in healthy and respiratory-diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of the cattle were infected with influenza D. The cattle with and without respiratory symptoms had approximately equal amounts of the virus. A full-genome sequence analysis revealed that the influenza D virus that was isolated in Japan formed an individual cluster that was distinct from the strains found in other countries. These results suggest that this virus might have evolved uniquely in Japan over a long period of time and that the viral pathology of Japanese strains might be different from the strains found in other countries. Continuous surveillance is required to determine the importance of this virus and to characterize its evolution.

AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease affecting the cattle industry. The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, respectively, in April–October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7%) and B (23.7%) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7%) being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses to BRD pathogenesis.

AB  - We identified novel viruses in feces from cattle with diarrhea collected in 2009 in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, by using a metagenomics approach and determined the (near) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyses revealed that they had a standard picornavirus genome organization, i.e. 5' untranslated region (UTR) - L- P1 (VP4- VP3- VP2- VP1) - P2 (2A- 2B- 2C) - P3 (3A- 3B- 3C-3D) - 3'UTR- poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; bat picornaviruses group 1-3, feline picornavirus, and canine picornavirus, sharing 45.4-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2), and 49.6-53.3% (P3) amino acid identities, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses and detailed genome characterization showed that they, together with the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses, grouped as a cluster for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. These viruses had conserved features (e.g. predicted protein cleavage sites, presence of a leader protein, 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D functional domains), suggesting they have a common ancestor. Reverse-transcription-PCR assays, using specific primers designed from the 5'UTR sequence of these viruses, showed that 23.0% (20/87) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, indicating the prevalence of these picornavirus in the Japanese cattle population in Hokkaido Prefecture. However, further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic potential and etiological role of these viruses in cattle.

AB  - A viral metagenomics approach was used to investigate fecal samples of Japanese calves with and without diarrhea. Of the different viral pathogens detected, read counts gave nearly complete astrovirus-related RNA sequences in 15 of the 146 fecal samples collected in three distinct areas (Hokkaido, Ishikawa, and Kagoshima Prefectures) between 2009 and 2015. Due to the lack of genetic information about bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to Chinese BoAstVs and clustered into a lineage (tentatively named lineage 1) in all phylogenetic trees. Three of 15 strains were phylogenetically separate from lineage 1, showing low sequence identities, and clustered instead with an American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively named lineage 2). Interestingly, two of 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b regions, while they clustered with lineage 2 in the ORF2 region. Remarkably, one of 15 strains exhibited low amino acid sequence similarity to other BoAstVs and was clustered separately with porcine astrovirus type 5 in all trees, and ovine astrovirus in the ORF2 region, suggesting past interspecies transmission.

AB  - This project sought to investigate the domestic caprid rumen virome by developing a robust viral DNA isolation and enrichment protocol (utilizing membrane filtration, ultra-centrifugation, overnight PEG treatment and nuclease treatment) and using RSD-PCR and high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques. 3.53% of the reads obtained were analogous to those of viruses denoting Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Mimiviridae, Microviridae, Poxviridae, Tectiviridae and Marseillevirus. Most of the sequenced reads from the rumen were similar to those of phages, which are critical in maintaining the rumen microbial populations under its carrying capacity. Though identified in the rumen, most of these viruses have been reported in other environments as well. Improvements in the viral DNA enrichment and isolation protocol are required to obtain data that are more representative of the rumen virome. The 102,130 unknown reads (92.31%) for the goat and 36,241 unknown reads (93.86%) for the sheep obtained may represent novel genomes that need further study.

AB  - During an investigation of porcine fecal viruses using a metagenomics approach, a novel picornavirus was identified from the feces of a healthy two-month-old pig. This virus, named porcine picornavirus Japan (PPVJ), had a standard picornavirus genome organization, including the L protein region. The 5' untranslated region harbored a type II internal ribosomal entry site. This virus was most closely related to lesavirus 1 (amino acid sequence identity: 38.2 %) in P1, equine rhinitis A virus (25.8 %) in P2, and lesavirus 2 (40.9 %) in P3. According to the genus demarcations for the family Picornaviridae (less than 40 %, 40 %, and 50 % amino acid sequence identity in P1, P2, and P3, respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. PPVJ was detected in 23.3 % of the fecal samples (from 58.3 % of the farms across a wide area) from pigs less than four months old, by reverse transcription PCR, using specific primers designed from the 3D sequence, followed by sequencing. The host range and pathogenic potential of this virus in animals is yet to be determined.

AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem for both dairy and beef cattle, resulting in significant economic loses. In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing, de novo assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirtyeight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (P<0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P = 0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (P = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and realtime PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies.

AB  - Porcine rotavirus C (RVC) is distributed throughout the world and is thought to be a pathogenic agent of diarrhea in piglets. Although, the VP7, VP4, and VP6 gene sequences of Japanese porcine RVCs are currently available, there is no whole-genome sequence data of Japanese RVC. Furthermore, only one to three sequences are available for porcine RVC VP1-VP3 and NSP1-NSP3 genes. Therefore, we determined nearly full-length whole-genome sequences of nine Japanese porcine RVCs from seven piglets with diarrhea and two healthy pigs and compared them with published RVC sequences from a database. The VP7 genes of two Japanese RVCs from healthy pigs were highly divergent from other known RVC strains and were provisionally classified as G12 and G13 based on the 86% nucleotide identity cut-off value. Pairwise sequence identity calculations and phylogenetic analyses revealed that candidate novel genotypes of porcine Japanese RVC were identified in the NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3 encoding genes, respectively. Furthermore, VP3 of Japanese porcine RVCs was shown to be closely related to human RVCs, suggesting a gene reassortment event between porcine and human RVCs and past interspecies transmission. The present study demonstrated that porcine RVCs show greater genetic diversity among strains than human and bovine RVCs.

AB  - Porcine Teschoviruses (PTVs) are associated with polioencephalomyelitis and various diseases, including reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders, of pigs and wild boars, and are also detected in the feces of healthy pigs. The genus Teschovirus contains a single species Teschovirus A that currently includes 13 serotypes. In the present study, we identified novel PTVs that are distantly related to Teschovirus A and were found in fecal samples of pigs with or without diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid (aa) sequences of the complete coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses did not cluster with any strains of PTVs or other strains within the picornavirus supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not belong to Teschovirus A or any genus of the family Picornaviridae. These novel PTVs share a type IV internal ribosomal entry site and conserved characteristic motifs in the coding region, yet exhibit 62.2–79.0%, 86.6–92.8%, 77.1–81.0%, and 84.3–86.7% aa identities to PTV strains in P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D regions, respectively. In contrast, PTV 1–13 strains of the Teschovirus A share 76.5–92.1%, 88.1–99.7%, 93.2–100%, and 95.8–100% aa identities in the P1, 2C, 3C, and 3D, respectively, within the species. These data imply that the newly identified viruses belong to teschoviruses, and may represent a novel species in the genus Teschovirus.

AB  - Goat diarrheal feces were subjected to metagenome analysis by the next-generation sequencing. Nucleotide sequences with homology to enteroviruses were obtained. Primers for RT-PCR were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of these sequences at the 5′-untranslated region, and we determined 563 bp nucleotide sequences that showed homology to bovine-like and ovine enteroviruses (77-87%). We named the virus detected in this study goat enterovirus G1 (GEV-G1). In the phylogenetic analysis, GEV-G1 belonged to a cluster containing ovine enteroviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report on nucleotide sequences of an enterovirus infecting Japanese goats. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.

AB  - Metagenomic sequencing of three nasal swabs collected from 10- to 21-day-old pigs exhibiting unexplained acute respiratory disease from two different commercial production facilities in Oklahoma identified a novel genotype of porcine astrovirus 4 (PAstV-4). The genomes had only ~75 % nucleotide sequence identity to previously characterized PAstV-4 isolates, while the capsid-encoding ORF2 had only ~53 % amino acid sequence identity to reference strains. A TaqMan assay targeting the novel ORF2 gene found 21 % and 19 % incidence in nasal and fecal swabs, respectively, submitted for unrelated diagnostic testing. PAstV-4 RNA levels were significantly higher (P = 0.04) in nasal swabs, suggesting a possible atypical respiratory tropism.

AB  - Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is clinically manifested by postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), respiratory and enteric disease, reproductive failure, and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical signs. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 × 107 genome copies/ml), and no other viruses were detected by PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of sow tissue samples identified PCV3 antigen in skin, kidney, lung, and lymph node samples localized in typical PDNS lesions, including necrotizing vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Further study of archived PDNS tissue samples that were negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis identified 45 of 48 that were PCV3 positive by quantitative PCR (qPCR), with 60% of a subset also testing positive for PCV3 by IHC analysis. Analysis by qPCR of 271 porcine respiratory disease diagnostic submission samples identified 34 PCV3-positive cases (12.5%), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of anti-PCV3 capsid antibodies in serum samples found that 46 (55%) of 83 samples tested were positive. These results suggest that PCV3 commonly circulates within U.S. swine and may play an etiologic role in reproductive failure and PDNS. Because of the high economic impact of PCV2, this novel circovirus warrants further studies to elucidate its significance and role in PCVAD.

AB  - Parvoviruses are a diverse group of viruses containing some of the smallest known species that are capable of infecting a wide range of animals. Metagenomic sequencing of pooled rectal swabs from adult pigs identified a 4103-bp contig consisting of two major open reading frames encoding proteins of 672 and 469 amino acids (aa) in length. BLASTP analysis of the 672-aa protein found 42.4 % identity to fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) parvovirus 2 (EhPV2) and 37.9 % to turkey parvovirus (TuPV) TP1-2012/HUN NS1 proteins. The 469-aa protein had no significant similarity to known proteins. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that PPV7, EhPV2, and TuPV represent a novel genus in the family Parvoviridae. Quantitative PCR screening of 182 porcine diagnostic samples found a total of 16 positives (8.6 %). Together, these data suggest that PPV7 is a highly divergent novel parvovirus prevalent within the US swine.

AB  - Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are bisegmented viruses with a wide geographical and host species distribution. The number of novel PBV sequences has been increasing with the help of the viral metagenomics. A novel picobirnavirus strain, pbv/CHK/M3841/HUN/2011, was identified by viral metagenomics; the complete segment 1 (MH327933) and 2 (MH327934) sequences were obtained by RT-PCR from a cloacal sample of a diseased broiler breeder pullet in Hungary. Although the conserved nucleotide (e.g., ribosome binding site) and amino acid motifs (e.g., ExxRxNxxxE, S-domain of the viral capsid and motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) were identifiable in the chicken picobirnavirus genome, the putative segment 1 showed low (< 30%) amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding proteins of marmot and dromedary PBVs, while segment 2 showed higher (< 70%) amino acid sequence identity to a wolf PBV protein sequence. This is the first full-genome picobirnavirus sequence from a broiler breeder chicken, but the pathogenicity of this virus is still questionable.

AB  - In June 2013, a 4-year-old Welsh Mountain ewe and in March 2014 a 10-day-old lamb of the same breed and the same flock presented progressive neurological signs including depressed sensorium, tremor, and unusual behaviour. Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord detected non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionitis, characteristic of a neurotropic viral agent in both sheep. Metagenomic analysis of different tissue samples from both animals identified a novel Ovine Astrovirus (OvAstV). The presence of viral genome in the central nervous system was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Although the cases presented nine months apart, the identified OvAstV shared nearly identical sequences, differing in only three nucleotide positions across the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relation of OvAstV to neurotropic bovine astroviruses and an enteric OvAstV. In conclusion, these are the first reported cases of astrovirus infection in domestic sheep that were associated with encephalitis and ganglionitis.

AB  - Background: Porcine circovirus 2 causes different clinical syndromes resulting in a significant economic loss in the pork industry. Three pigs with unexplained cardiac and multi-organ inflammation that tested negative for PCV2 and other known porcine pathogens were further analyzed. Methods: Histology was used to identify microscopic lesions in multiple tissues. Metagenomics was used to detect viral sequences in tissue homogenates. In situ hybridization was used to detect viral RNA expression in cardiac tissue. Results: In all three cases we characterized the genome of a new circovirus we called PCV3 with a replicase and capsid proteins showing 55 and 35 % identities to the genetically-closest proteins from a bat-feces associated circovirus and were even more distant to those of porcine circovirus 1 and 2. Common microscopic lesions included non-suppurative myocarditis and/or cardiac arteriolitis. Viral mRNA was detected intralesionally in cardiac cells. Deep sequencing in tissues also revealed the presence of porcine astrovirus 4 in all three animals as well as rotavirus A, porcine cytomegalovirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in individual cases. Conclusion: The pathogenicity and molecular epidemiology of this new circovirus, alone or in the context of co-infections, warrants further investigations.

AB  - Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it.

AB  - Virome (viral megagenomics) detection using next generation sequencing has been widely applied in virology, but its methods remain complicated and need optimization. In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of no statistical significance. Moreover, 11 mammalian viral genera in minks were possibly identified for the first time through this study.

AB  - The family Astroviridae consists of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus, whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts, respectively. We serendipitously identified a novel ovine astrovirus in a fecal specimen from a domestic sheep (Ovis aries) in Hungary by viral metagenomic analysis. Sequencing of the fragment indicated that it was an ORF1b/ORF2/3′UTR sequence, and it has been submitted to the GenBank database as ovine astrovirus type 2 (OAstV-2/Hungary/2009) with accession number JN592482. The unique sequence characteristics and the phylogenetic position of OAstV-2 suggest that genetically divergent lineages of astroviruses exist in sheep. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In 2011, a novel Orthobunyavirus was identified in cattle and sheep in Germany and The Netherlands. This virus was named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Later, presence of the virus was confirmed using real time RT-PCR in cases of congenital malformations of bovines and ovines in several European countries, including Belgium. In the absence of specific sequencing protocols for this novel virus we confirmed its presence in RT-qPCR positive field samples using DNase SISPA-next generation sequencing (NGS), a virus discovery method based on random amplification and next generation sequencing. An in vitro transcribed RNA was used to construct a standard curve allowing the quantification of viral RNA in the field samples. Two field samples of aborted lambs containing 7.66 and 7.64 log(10) RNA copies per micro L total RNA allowed unambiguous identification of SBV. One sample yielded 192 SBV reads covering about 81% of the L segment, 56% of the M segment and 13% of the S segment. The other sample resulted in 8 reads distributed over the L and M segments. Three weak positive field samples (one from an aborted calf, two from aborted lambs) containing virus quantities equivalent to 4.27-4.89 log(10) RNA copies per micro L did not allow identification using DNase SISPA-NGS. This partial sequence information was compared to the whole genome sequence of SBV isolated from bovines in Germany, identifying several sequence differences. The applied viral discovery method allowed the confirmation of SBV in RT-qPCR positive brain samples. However, the failure to confirm SBV in weak PCR-positive samples illustrates the importance of the selection of properly targeted and fresh field samples in any virus discovery method. The partial sequences derived from the field samples showed several differences compared to the sequences from bovines in Germany, indicating sequence divergence within the epidemic.

AB  - Background: The pig faecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses present in pig faeces, is complex and consists of pig viruses, bacteriophages, transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species. Only little is known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. Results: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55-77%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8-10%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and "circovirus-like" viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group. Conclusion: The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method. © 2014 Sachsenröder et al.

AB  - Using viral metagenomics we analyzed four bovine serum pools assembled from 715 calves in the United States. Two parvoviruses, bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) and a previously uncharacterized parvovirus designated as bosavirus (BosaV), were detected in 3 and 4 pools respectively and their complete coding sequences generated. Based on NS1 protein identity, bosavirus qualifies as a member of a new species in the copiparvovirus genus. Also detected were low number of reads matching ungulate tetraparvovirus 2, bovine hepacivirus, and several papillomaviruses. This study further characterizes the diversity of viruses in calf serum with the potential to infect fetuses and through fetal bovine serum contaminate cell cultures.

AB  - The incidence and severity of respiratory diseases in commercial broiler chicken flocks have increased recently in India because of intensification of the broiler industry. Viral population are predominant in respiratory tract infections and they pose continuous economic burden to poultry industry by causing severe economic losses through decreased productivity [1], [2]. To understand viral metagenome of poultry associated with respiratory infections, we performed DNA virome sequencing and data analysis of broilers from 8 districts of Gujarat State in India. We report high quality sequencing reads and highly abundant DNA viral population present in the infected broiler birds. The raw sequencing data used to perform metagenomic analysis is available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the BioProject No. PRJNA322592 and Accession No. MAUZ00000000, MAVA00000000, MAVB00000000, MAVC00000000, MAVD00000000, MAVE00000000, MAVF00000000, MAVG00000000 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA322592).

AB  - Recently, there have been reports of new members of posavirus-like viruses in the order Picornavirales. In this study, using a metagenomics approach, 11 posavirus-like sequences (>7,000 nucleotides) were detected in 155 porcine fecal samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the newly identified virus sequences, together with other posavirus-like viruses, form distinct clusters within the order Picornavirales, composed of eight genogroups and unassigned sequences based on amino acid sequences of the helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions, with <40 % and <50 % sequence identity, respectively. We propose further classifications of highly diverse posavirus populations based on newly identified sequences from Japanese pig feces.

AB  - Background: Currently, eight species in four genera of parvovirus have been described that infect swine. These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate tetraparvovirus 3 (which includes PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (which includes PPV4 and PPV5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (which includes porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 (porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1 and 4-2). PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. Prevalence of PPV6 in China was found to be similar in finishing age pigs from farms with and without evidence of swine reproductive failure. Methods: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive samples. Results: Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 2 positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined PPV6 to be present in 13.2 % of the serums tested. Additionally, PPV6 was present in samples from all of the geographic locations sampled encompassing nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum indicates that the PPV6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a specific tissue type. Alignments of the near full length genomes, NS1, and capsid genes identified one of the five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5 % identity with the North American strains) to be the North American strains nearest relative. Conclusions: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in the United States and in Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic animals is relatively low. Further, all of the PPV6 genomes found in North America are most closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in 2014 in healthy pigs from the Tianjin province of China.

AB  - Encephalitis can be caused by several infectious agents, including bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. In many cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous disorders and died within 6 days after the onset of clinical signs. The histopathology revealed an acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brain stem, and a ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necroses in both the brain and the ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and viral infections of cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain sample from the cow was analysed using a metagenomics approach with next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) could be identified using the analysis pipeline RIEMS, and the finding could be confirmed with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome of the bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), belonging to the family Astroviridae in the genus Mamastrovirus, has a length of 6478 bp. Sequence identities between 71% to a sheep astrovirus and 69% to two recently described bovine astroviruses from the USA and Switzerland were ascertained. The latter were also connected to encephalitis cases in cattle. Like these, the new virus described here was detected in different brain sections using the specific BoAstV RT-qPCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization. In conclusion, while astroviruses so far were mainly found in relation to gastroenteritis in animals and humans, recently detected astrovirus infections were also related to encephalitis.

AB  - RNA viruses have been associated with enteritis in poultry and have been isolated from diseased birds. The same viral agents have also been detected in healthy flocks bringing into question their role in health and disease. In order to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles, which do not involve the use of density gradients, for generating viral metagenome data. In this study, the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for RNA viruses from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, with the use of the best method and increased sequencing depth, a glimpse of the RNA viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is presented. The viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified. The rarefaction curve at the species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was included with the increased sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other viral families were present in very low abundance.

AB  - Several RNA viruses such as astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus and parvovirus have been detected in both healthy and diseased commercial poultry flocks. The aim of this study was to characterize (a) the development of the RNA viral community in the small intestines of healthy broiler chickens from hatch through 6 weeks of age (market age) and (b) the contribution of the breeder source vs. bird age in development of the community structure. Intestinal tissue samples were harvested from breeders and their progeny, processed for viral RNA extraction and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq sequencing technology resulting in 100 bp PE reads. The results from this study indicated that the breeder source influenced the RNA viral community only at hatch but later environment i.e. bird age had the more significant effect. The most abundant RNA viral family detected at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age was Astroviridae, which decreased in abundance with age while the abundance of Picornaviridae increased with age.

AB  - Swine are an important source of proteins worldwide but are subject to frequent viral outbreaks and numerous infections capable of infecting humans. Modern farming conditions may also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheic piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrheic pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families Circoviridae, and Parvoviridae. Porcine RNA viruses identified, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. The near-full genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the Picornavirales order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensely farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses providing favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral surveys of animals can readily document the circulation of known and new viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - In recent years, innovations in molecular techniques and sequencing technologies have resulted in a rapid expansion in the number of known viral sequences, in particular those with circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA genomes. CRESS DNA viruses are present in the virome of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide range of organisms. A large number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into any known viral families, indicating that the current view of CRESS DNA viral sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal faecal matter has proven to be a particularly useful source for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem, as it is cost-effective and non-invasive. In this study a viral metagenomic approach was used to explore the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the faeces of domesticated and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (that may be defective molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from forty-nine individual animal faecal samples. Based on shared genome organisations and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates were classified as smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity with any members of known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, emphasising the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforcing the suggestion that a large proportion of CRESS DNA viruses are yet to be identified.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, leading to an expanded interest in the composition of the porcine enteric virome. In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production.

AB  - Enteric diseases in swine are often caused by different pathogens and thus metagenomics are a useful tool for diagnostics. The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet's microbiome. Contigs matched Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10<sup>6.42</sup>-10<sup>7.01</sup> copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.

AB  - Two full-genome sequences of porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) are reported. The genomes were recovered from pooled serum samples from sows who had just delivered litters with variable numbers of stillbirths. The two circular genomes (PCV3-BR/RS/6 and PCV3-BR/RS/8) are 2,000 nucleotides long and contain two open reading frames (ORFs) oriented in opposite directions that encode the putative capsid (Cap) and replicase (Rep) proteins. The intergenic region contains a stem-loop motif, as reported for other circoviruses. Rolling circle replication motifs and putative helicase domains were identified in the Rep coding region. The degree of overall nucleotide similarity between the genomes reported here and those available at GenBank was higher than 97%. No PCV3 sequence was detected in pooled serum samples from sows which had no stillbirths on the same farms. However, further studies are necessary to confirm the association between PCV3 and the occurrence of stillbirths.

AB  - The family Coronaviridae represents a diverse group of vertebrate RNA viruses, all with genomes greater than 26 000 nt. Here, we report the discovery and genetic characterization of a novel virus present in cattle with respiratory disease. Phylogenetic characterization of this virus revealed that it clusters within the subfamily Torovirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. The complete genome consists of only 20 261 nt and represents the smallest reported coronavirus genome. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, tentatively named bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the recently described python-borne nidoviruses and contains several conserved nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the NendoU or O-MT domains that are present in other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. In concert with its reduced genome, the atypical domain architecture indicates that this virus represents a unique lineage within the order Nidovirales.

AB  - To study the genetic diversity of enterovirus G (EV-G) among Japanese pigs, metagenomics sequencing was performed on fecal samples from pigs with or without diarrhea, collected between 2014 and 2016. Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were >5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C–3A junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains. Our findings may advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of EV-Gs.

AB  - Since early 2017, in Spain there was an apparent increase in reports on rotavirus involvement in neonatal diarrhoea outbreaks, affecting also adult sows. In this study, 16 unrelated outbreaks of diarrhoea in suckling pigs and sows, where rotavirus A was the only pathogen detected, were investigated. Deep-sequencing was performed on total RNA from twenty-four positive faecal samples. Genotyping, phylogenetic and bayesian analyses showed that all isolates had a common ancestor of porcine, or human porcine-like, origin. The new strain was introduced in the population shortly before the onset of the outbreaks. Besides, a high diversification of the VP7 and VP4 genes occurred in a short time. Isolates presented a high number of amino acid changes in the neutralizing epitopes compared to vaccine sequences. The present report illustrates how a new rotavirus A strain may disseminate rapidly and the extremely high diversification that this pathogen may undergo in a short period.

AB  - Background: Free-range cattle are common in the Northeast China area, which have close contact with farmers and may carry virus threatening to cattle and farmers. Methods: Using viral metagenomics we analyzed the virome in plasma samples collected from 80 cattle from the forested region of Northeast China. Results: The virome of cattle plasma is composed of the viruses belonging to the families including Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and divergent viral genomes showing sequence similarity to circular Rep-encoding single stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses. Five such CRESS-DNA genomes were full characterized, with Rep sequences related to circovirus and gemycircularvirus. Three bovine parvoviruses belonging to two different genera were also characterized. Conclusion: The virome in plasma samples of cattle from the forested region of Northeast China was revealed, which further characterized the diversity of viruses in cattle plasma.

AB  - Recombination occurs frequently between enteroviruses (EVs) which are classified within the same species of the Picornaviridae family. Here, using viral metagenomics, the genomes of two recombinant EV-Gs (strains EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014 and EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) found in the feces of pigs from a swine farm in China are described. The two strains are characterized by distinct insertion of a papain-like protease gene from toroviruses classified within the Coronaviridae family. According to recent reports the site of the torovirus protease insertion was located at the 2C/3A junction region in EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014. For the other variant EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014, the inserted protease sequence replaced the entire viral capsid protein region up to the VP1/2A junction. These two EV-G strains were highly prevalent in the same pig farm with all animals shedding the full-length genome (EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) while 65% also shed the capsid deletion mutant (EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014). A helper-defective virus relationship between the two co-circulating EV-G recombinants is hypothesized.

AB  - Non-suppurative encephalitis is one of the most frequent pathological diagnosis in cattle with neurological disease, but there is a gap in the knowledge on disease-associated pathogens. In order to identify viruses that are associated with non-suppurative encephalitis in cattle, we used a viral metagenomics approach on a sample set of 16 neurologically-diseased cows. We detected six virus candidates: parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5), bovine astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1), bovine polyomavirus 2 (BPyV-2 SF), ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), bovine herpesvirus 6 (BHV-6) and a novel bovine betaretrovirus termed BoRV-CH15. In a case-control study using PCR, BoAstV-CH13 (p=0.046), BoPV-2 SF (p=0.005) and BoHV-6 (p=4.3E-05) were statistically associated with the disease. These data expand our knowledge on encephalitis-associated pathogens in cattle and point to the value of NGS in resolving complex infection scenarios in a clinical disease setting.

AB  - Ticks are medically-important arthropods that maintain and transmit numerous emerging viruses. China suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited. Here we report the virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from SFTS-epidemic areas, and serological investigation of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV). Results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera, including SFTSV and NSDV. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the SFTSV identified here was most closely related to human SFTSV in sampling and surrounding areas, and the NSDV to the previously identified NSDV from northeast China. Serological investigation of SFTSV infection in goats revealed intensive activity in those areas. Surprisingly, two different methods of NSDV serological investigation showed no sera positive for this virus.

AB  - Using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method, one DNA sequence (contig01006), suspected to belong to a novel porcine bocavirus (PBoV), was found with a high rate of detection (19. 6 %) in fecal samples from healthy piglets. Moreover, a novel PBoV (tentatively named PBoV3C) with a nearly complete genome sequence (5235 bp) was identified. PBoV3C exhibits typical genome characteristics of bocaviruses and shows the highest genomic sequence identity (78 % to 81 %) to PBoV3A/B (PBoV3/4-UK) and PBoV3D/E (PBoV3/4-HK), respectively. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis indicated high diversity, prevalence and complexity among the PBoVs. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) site of VP1 and the secondary structure of VP2 of PBoV3C were also analyzed. Additionally, we propose a uniform method of PBoV nomenclature based on the VP1 gene. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: Pigs are well known source of human infectious disease. To better understand the spectrum of viruses present in pigs, we utilized the 454 Life Sciences GS-FLX high-throughput sequencing platform to sequence stool samples from healthy pigs. Findings. Total nucleic acid was extracted from stool samples of healthy piglets and randomly amplified. The amplified materials were pooled and processed using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique. The raw sequences were deconvoluted on the basis of the barcode and then processed through a standardized bioinformatics pipeline. The unique reads (348, 70 and 13) had limited similarity to known astroviruses, bocaviruses and parechoviruses. Specific primers were synthesized to assess the prevalence of the viruses in healthy piglets. Our results indicate extremely high rates of positivity. Conclusions: Several novel astroviruses, bocaviruses and Ljungan-like viruses were identified in stool samples from healthy pigs. The rates of isolation for the new viruses were high. The high detection rate, diverse sequences and categories indicate that pigs are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of different enteric viruses. © 2013 Yu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Avian influenza virus A of the novel H7N9 reassortant subtype was recently found to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using realtime reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (n=31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal- segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus- 4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact coinfected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have increasingly played crucial roles in biological and medical research, but are not yet in routine use in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture-derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with a PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct ≤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct ≤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct ≤ 20.6. For mixtures with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them as well as obtain their respective genome sequences. For mixtures with 2 PRRSV-2 isolates (92.4% nucleotide identity), sequence reads with nucleotide ambiguity at numerous sites were observed, indicating mixed infection; however, individual virus sequences could only be separated when 1 isolate identity and sequence in the mixture is known. The NGS approach described herein offers the prospect of high-throughput sequencing and could be adapted to routine workflows in veterinary diagnostic laboratories, although further improvement of sequencing outcomes from clinical specimens with higher Ct values remains to be investigated.

AB  - Ducks play an important role in transmitting and maintaining mammalian viruses in nature, and are a reservoir host of many animal viruses. We analyzed the fecal virome of four strains (A, B, C, and D) of ducks living in isolation by using metagenomic analysis. The feces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal virus families. The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods, and highlights the variation in the percentage of viral families present. These results can be used as a reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) was detected in Shandong, China. One hundred and thirty-two of 222 (59.46%) samples were PCV3 positive, while 52 of 132 (39.39%) samples were co-infected with PCV2. There were no clinical signs of infection in either multiparous sows or live-born infants. Two strains of PCV3 were indentified from natural stillborn foetuses. Phylogenetic analysis showed the two strains of PCV3 are 96% identical to the known PCV3/Pig/USA (KX778720.1, KX966193.1 and KX898030.1) and closely related to Barbel Circovirus. Further studies of the epidemiology of PCV3 and the co-infection with PCV2 are needed.
